# Joe Rogan Experience #2234 - Marc Andreessen
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [November 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye8MOfxD5nU)
*  Hello. Good to see you. Thanks for having me back. My pleasure. Good to see you. Where
*  the world's still functional. It's amazing. Yeah, amazing. We wanted to talk, you wanted
*  to talk about the post-election sort of a wrap up. Yeah. Sort of where we stand. Are
*  you happy? Very happy. It was a weird one. Morning in America. That was one of the first
*  times ever I felt hopeful after an election. Like you should have seen the green room
*  at the comedy club. Everybody was like, yes. Yes. Whoo. So my theory is the timeline, like
*  in a science fiction movie, the timeline has split twice in the last, in the last like
*  nine months. What was the first split? That was when Trump got shot. Oh, yeah. And there
*  was that moment where the world was going to head in two totally different directions.
*  Right. If he got hit. Yeah. Yeah. And we saw the most conspicuous display of physical bravery
*  I've ever seen. Right. At that moment. Exactly. And it could have gone horrifically badly
*  for the entire world after that. So that was timeline split number one. So that other
*  timelines out there somewhere. Yeah. And I don't want to visit it. Boy, imagine being
*  stuck there. What kind of horrible karma? No. I mean, that's a totalitarian dystopian
*  nightmare. That's the bad place. Yeah. And then timeline split again on election day.
*  I know you're you fancy a good conspiracy theory. Yes. And that that gentleman being
*  able to pull off what he did. And, you know, the way it happened, the way it all went down
*  is it's a Lee Harvey Oswald 2.0. Oh, yeah. Clearly. Yeah. The shooter. Yeah. That we
*  still don't know anything. There's no call for disclosure. There's no call for a press
*  conference. There's no toxicology report. The toxicology report had to have been done.
*  Wouldn't you want to know what kind of stuff this kid is on that made him want to do that?
*  Or if anything. Yeah. So my theory is it's almost as if the people want us to think it's
*  a conspiracy. Like it's almost like the whole thing is almost orchestrated. Like it's just
*  it's so strange. This is like the rapid cremation. Like the whole thing was just completely
*  bizarre. And then you're exactly right. Like no hearings. No, no, nothing. Now, having
*  said that, I expect that this will change. Right. So you think they're going to do a
*  dive into what happened? I mean, I would. I don't know if they will. But, you know,
*  I certainly would if I was in a position to do that. I wonder what they can actually find.
*  I mean, I don't know if they wanted it to be a conspiracy that people talked about or
*  if that's simply the best way to pull it off. Yeah. Or it's just yeah. Or it's just, you
*  know, as we saw, I think in the hearing afterwards, maybe just a systemic collapse of competence.
*  There's also a confidence in the fact that the the news timeline today is so rapid that
*  when things are relevant and people are paying attention to them is you have a couple of
*  days, even with an assassination attempt on a former president where people were murdered.
*  And there's it's in and out. Yeah, that's right. I think it's exactly I think the news
*  cycle now is like a two to three day social media firestorm. And we just cycle from one
*  to the next. Yeah. And we have the memory of goldfish and right. You know, things right.
*  Things that would have been error defining just come and go with astonishing speed and
*  shock. By the way, I should say I don't think there was I doubt there was a conspiracy.
*  I think anything's possible. I think it's just we have a competence collapse. And I
*  think we saw that on display when the when the director at the time testified. Well,
*  there's all the elements that could have been a conspiracy. But this is kind of the thing,
*  which is this like it also could have been right. Systemic competence collapse. And then
*  it's like, OK, would it be better off for the Institute? You know, if it looks like
*  a conspiracy. Right. Yeah. You know, which OK, two timelines. Which world would you
*  rather live in, the one with the conspiracies or the one with just like incompetence everywhere?
*  Well, I think you have both simultaneously. I don't think it's binary. Right. I think
*  there's incompetence everywhere. And conspiracies are legitimate. They're real. Yeah. And that
*  one seems like conspiracy. The fact that is his house was professionally scrubbed. There's
*  no social media record of this kid online. There's no nothing. He's the only kid of his
*  generation who's that far enough about politics to have no online foot. Right. It just doesn't
*  make any sense. He's a registered Republican. The whole thing is like so weird. And he was
*  like a bad shooter and then he became a great shooter. And well, he definitely trained.
*  Yeah. Right. You could train someone to be a good shooter. This is all you have to do.
*  But don't move and do that. Get all your mechanics in place. Understand technique and positioning.
*  Breathing is not like the most complicated thing from a prone position. Right. But the
*  chose to use iron sights I thought was weird too. There's a lot of weirdness to it. You
*  know, from 140 yards with a scope, that is an easy shot. Yeah. Well, then he could just
*  like wander up. That's the different timeline. The different timeline is he has a scope and
*  that's it. Okay. All right. Right. That would have. And Trump's dead. And then boy, boy,
*  we live in a crazy world then. Yeah. Completely bizarre. I mean, what do the streets look
*  like right now? Yeah. What kind of like protests and riots and. Yeah. You think January 6 was
*  nice. If they had killed Trump, that would be January 6 on steroids everywhere. Yeah.
*  That's right. And we would we would experience it. I mean, you know, I don't know. When I
*  was a kid, my my high school high school history teacher got us a bootleg copy of the Zapruder
*  film. Really? Which I was like, what a gangster high school. He was actually pretty focused
*  on that. He really loved the Kennedy assassination. So we spent a lot of time on that. And you
*  know, you know, you kind of watch it frame by frame and you can kind of see what's happening
*  with his lots of questions. But like when things like that happen, you know, today, it's going
*  to be a high definition 4K ultra surrounds on forever. Yeah. Right. Playing out in real
*  time forever. And so like, yeah, I very much don't want to live in the world where those
*  things happen. Well, we are very fortunate. I mean, like I said, after the election, I
*  was like, wow, voting works. Voting works. That's nice. Like, they don't have the system
*  completely rigged. And then but they kind of tried to rig it, at least with the media,
*  the where the real rigging in the 2020 elections. You can cast all your conspiracies upon it
*  was in terms of like mail in ballots and all this jazz. But the real rigging was the
*  collusion between social media companies and the government to suppress information that
*  would have altered the effect of the election. That's legitimate. Oh, yeah, for sure. Yeah.
*  That was like direct interference. And it was in aided and abetted by a lot of former
*  intelligence officials and by the current administration, you know, tons of pressure
*  on censorship coming from this, you know, the current administration and all their kind
*  of arms of the censorship, censorship apparatus. You have your hands in the tech community,
*  you have your fingers in all that jazz. Like, what was the general attitude about all that
*  stuff when it was revealed? How did how did people you know, how did your peers respond
*  to that? I think anybody in social media, the internet companies knew it. So I think
*  it was pretty widely understood. I mean, look, there's nothing that happened at Twitter
*  and the Twitter files. It wasn't happening all the all the other companies. Right. It's
*  a consistent pattern. If you got the YouTube files, they would look exactly the same. And
*  of course, we should get the YouTube file. Sure. And now we probably we probably will
*  now with this new administration is probably going to carve all this stuff open. But yeah,
*  no, look, it was a pattern. And then look, you know, the companies bear a lot of responsibility
*  and the people in the companies, you know, made a lot of I think bad judgment calls.
*  But the government like the Biden White House was directly exerting censorship pressure
*  on American companies to censor American citizens, which I think, by the way, is just
*  flatly illegal. Like I think it's actually subject to criminal charges. Like I think
*  there are people with criminal liability who are involved in this. So there was that there
*  were also members of Congress doing the same thing, which is also illegal. And then there
*  was a lot of funding of outside third party groups that were that were bringing a lot
*  of pressure down on censorship. Yeah. And just an example of that is there's a unit at Stanford,
*  you know, right next door, you know, to us that, you know, was the Internet censorship
*  unit that was funded by the U.S. government and exerted tremendous pressure on the companies
*  to censor. And it was and was very effective at doing so.
*  Does it smell like sulfur when you walk those halls?
*  It is very dark and grim. This whole thing is very bad.
*  And so Stanford. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Stanford, Stanford, by the way, another unit like that
*  at Harvard. You know, a bunch of universities got pulled into this. A lot of NGOs and
*  nonprofits got pulled into this. And so the Twitter file showed us kind of the basic
*  roadmap. And then there's this thing called the Weaponization Committee that Congressman
*  Jordan is running that has also revealed a lot of this. But I I would imagine the new
*  Trump administration is going to come in and carve all that wide open. And I know that
*  there are people in being appointed to senior positions who are very determined to do
*  that. This episode is brought to you by blinds dot com.

*  One of the things that I found really kind of shocking was when they revealed how much money the Democrats had spent on the election and how much money was spent on activist groups.
*  It's like more than a hundred million dollars.
*  Right. Yeah. There's just there's extensive government funding of politically oriented NGOs.
*  Yeah.
*  NGOs one of those great terms like non-governmental organization.
*  All right. Like what what what the hell is that?
*  Tell me. I don't know.
*  Well it's it's sort of a charity and but it's sort of sort of.
*  But most of the time it's a it's a political entity.
*  It's an entity with a political agenda.
*  But then it's funded by the government in a very large percentage of cases including the NGOs in the censorship complex like the government grants National Science Foundation grants like direct state department grants.
*  Yeah. Right. Direct money.
*  And then OK. Now you've got an NGO funded by the government.
*  Well that's not an NGO.
*  Right. That's a GEO.
*  Right. Right. And then you've got a conspiracy.
*  Like when censorship then you have a conspiracy because you've got government officials using government money to fund where what look like private organizations that aren't.
*  And then what happens is the government outsources to these NGOs the things that it's not legally allowed to do.
*  Like what.
*  Like like censorship.
*  Oh OK.
*  Like violation of First Amendment rights.
*  Right. The government is on the first.
*  So what they always say is the First Amendment only applies to the government.
*  The First Amendment says the government cannot cannot censor American citizens.
*  And so what they do is if you want to censor American citizens in the government if you're smart you don't do that which you do is you fund an outside organization and then you have them do it.
*  Boy.
*  Right. And that's what's been happening.
*  Right. And that's like hiring a hitman.
*  Like it's not OK to murder someone but you can hire someone to murder someone and then you're clean.
*  Yeah. And if you want to solve a murder it's not enough to find out who the hitman was you have to find out who paid the hitman.
*  Right.
*  You want to work your way up the chain.
*  And so a lot a lot of this traces into the White House.
*  The best defense the companies have is that a lot of this happened under coercion.
*  Right. Because when the government when the government puts pressure on you like it might be a phone call it might be a letter it might be the threat of an investigation it might be a subpoena.
*  It could take many forms.
*  But when the government does that it carries you know that's a very powerful message.
*  Right.
*  It's like a message from my boss.
*  Right. Right.
*  Don't you want to do me a favor.
*  It's like yes Mr.
*  Gambino I do.
*  Right.
*  Like I like my corner store.
*  I'd like it's not catching fire tonight.
*  Yeah.
*  And so there's there's this overwhelming hammer blow pressure that comes in.
*  And by the way even when the government doesn't talk to you directly if they're funding the organization that is talking to you then it's very clear what's happening.
*  And so you come under incredible pressure.
*  And so the whole kind of chain this whole chain of governments activists universities and companies was corrupted.
*  And then on top of that people in the companies in a lot of cases made a lot of decisions that I think they're probably increasingly starting to regret.
*  What was confusing to me was that the government spent so much money on these activist groups during the election and I didn't understand like what purpose that would serve.
*  Like what what function would it serve to spend all this money on these activist groups that already support you supposedly.
*  Like are you bribing them to support you.
*  Are they.
*  What are they.
*  Are they.
*  Are you paying them to go on talk shows and consistently repeat the government's message the current administration's message.
*  Like what will be the function of that.
*  So I think in some cases it's just it's just pay to play.
*  Right.
*  So for example we know that Kamala's campaign paid certain on her personalities you know fall in and then there were there were you know it's your point people very supportive of Kamala who then gave her interviews that went really well.
*  And so I think in some cases you just have straight pay to play.
*  That's just how that system works.
*  It's just expected.
*  And then I think you have other organizations like like these NGOs and others activist groups where they're actually you know they actually do field activities.
*  Right.
*  And so there's you know maybe there's a get out the vote component or there's you know social media influence downstream component or some other you know kind of field activity that's happening in support of the election.
*  I just didn't think that they pay like when it's still unclear whether or not celebrities got paid to endorse her.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  They've mixed it up because there's like Oprah said Oprah says her production company was paid to put on the production but she was not paid for the interview.
*  Yeah whatever.
*  But it was you know to whatever to me.
*  Two and a half million dollars was initially listed as one and it turned out it was two point five.
*  Right.
*  And so like production company.
*  Right.
*  And my production company gets paid two point five million dollars to endorse Trump.
*  Right.
*  And then I go I didn't get any of that money.
*  Right.
*  People like shut the fuck up.
*  It's your company.
*  What are you talking about.
*  Yeah.
*  And also how much does it cost to do an event.
*  Yes.
*  How does it cost two point five million dollars to put on an event like are you feeding people gold sandwiches.
*  What are you doing.
*  How is that possible.
*  Yeah exactly.
*  So yeah.
*  And then you consider the fact that it's deliberately obfuscated of course is a clue.
*  I just thought the really bizarre one was the allegations and I'd say unsubstantiated allegations.
*  It's been alleged that Beyonce got 10 million dollars and Lizzo got three million dollars.
*  Eminem got one point eight million.
*  Really.
*  I think if you just like published all these numbers these celebrities will get so mad at each other that you know then you would learn everything.
*  Eminem got short.
*  Right.
*  Lizzo's furious right now.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  Lizzo's probably listening to this right now being like what.
*  Well I wonder if Lizzo's like I didn't get shit.
*  I would say it.
*  But why haven't they said it.
*  Like Beyonce has been mum about the whole thing.
*  I think I would probably say like I didn't get any money to do that.
*  But that was a weird one too because a lot of people thought Beyonce was going to do a concert.
*  Right.
*  And she just went out there and talked and everybody's like what the fuck because they all came to see a free Beyonce concert.
*  And then she just said I want to support Kamala Harris.
*  And everybody's like good good.
*  Now if you like it then you should have put a ring on it.
*  Come on.
*  We love your songs.
*  That's what we're here for.
*  Yes.
*  I just didn't think that it was even possible that a I didn't think a candidate would ever pay for an endorsement.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean the fact that it was even alleged.
*  Yeah.
*  Well you know and then there's of course there's there's the even stinkier version arguably which is all the all the social media influencer campaigns now.
*  There's you know tremendous amount of payola.
*  That's for sure.
*  Right.
*  Because I know people personally who are approached multiple times and offered a substantial amount of money to post things in support of Harris.
*  Yeah.
*  And like I'm pro capitalism and I'm happy for them to think it paid but like maybe we should know.
*  Yeah that seems like something you should absolutely have to disclose.
*  It should be like like say if I was going to do an ad for you know whatever a certain coffee company Black Rifle Coffee and I did it on my Instagram.
*  I'd have to say add.
*  I have to say this is an ad.
*  It's a paid ad.
*  And that's part of the thing.
*  You know unless it's your company.
*  Like you're supposed to say they're paying me to do this.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Well you know look the good news with these is we learn each cycle we learn a lot about how politics works.
*  We learn about a lot about how fake it is.
*  We learn a lot about the things we put up with for a very long time.
*  I mean everybody's always like freaked out by like whatever the new guy does but like this real scandal in most cases I think is just the way the system already works.
*  It's a sneaky system.
*  Well another fascinating aspect of the system that we learned out this time around is the uncontrolled aspect of it.
*  Like what Trump called earned media was much more powerful than anything else.
*  The uncontrolled version of it like one of the things that unfortunately for them mass media or corporate media has done is they've diminished their credibility so much so much so that like Joy Reid was on TV today talking about saying that Trump was going to shoot protesters and just wild unsubstantiated crazy shit.
*  And the more they do stuff like that the more that they say things like that the more it diminishes their impact and the more it drives people to independent media sources.
*  Yeah I'm sure you've seen the ratings collapse that they've been they've been they're down to like they're down to like MSNBC is down to like 50,000 people in the 18 to 20 18 to 49 demo.
*  That is so wild which is tiny.
*  It's so crazy.
*  It's really tiny.
*  So I think that's happening.
*  The Gallup organization has done polls on trust in institutions including media for the last 60 years.
*  It's been a steady slide down and in the last four years it's fallen off a cliff.
*  I think it's real.
*  There's another study that came out.
*  The kids are not watching a lot less TV.
*  Kids are just giving up on TV.
*  Yeah.
*  And they're just you know they're on YouTube and tick tock and Instagram and other things.
*  And so like I think it's tipping.
*  Question I've been asking myself is when when will the actual you know famously 1960 was the first television election.
*  Right.
*  You know sort of legend has it because it was the one where the televised debate really mattered.
*  And if you saw the televised debate you saw confident Kennedy and nervous Nixon and if you heard right you experience something different.
*  And handsomeness and hands and vitality health.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  And all these things sort of positive positive spirit positive energy.
*  I'm actually not this might be have been the first Internet election or maybe we actually haven't had it yet.
*  Like I feel like we're really close to the first Internet election but maybe it's not all the way there.
*  This is it.
*  I think this is there's an argument that this is it.
*  Right.
*  And that you know all the you know all the stuff especially in the last six months all the podcasts obviously in your show played a big role.
*  But like I think there's a real if you're going to run in 28 like I think there's like a fully Internet native way to run these campaigns that might literally involve like zero television advertising.
*  And maybe you don't even need to raise that money.
*  And maybe to your point if you have the right message maybe you just go straight direct.
*  Yeah I think completely different way to do this.
*  I think that's the only way now.
*  And I think if you do pay people it's not going to have the same impact.
*  You know I think these call her daddy shows and all these different shows that she went on.
*  I mean I'm sure they had an impact.
*  But I think that in the future I'm sure they're scrambling to try to create their own version of this show.
*  This is one thing that keeps coming up like we need our own Joe Rogan.
*  But they had me.
*  Number one they had you.
*  Number one they had you.
*  They had you in the drove you away.
*  Is that number one number.
*  But they also have you know ABC NBC CBS CNN.
*  Right. But that doesn't work anymore.
*  That's like you know like you're using smoke signals and everybody else has a cell phone.
*  It doesn't work.
*  Yeah that's right.
*  That's right.
*  It's just it's it's a bizarre time.
*  It's really interesting though.
*  Like as you said like we're in a great timeline.
*  And I think it's a fascinating timeline too because there's so much uncertainty and there's so much right.
*  We're at the verge of A.I.
*  You know open A.I.
*  You know Altman has said now that he thinks 2025 will be the year that A.I. becomes sentient whatever that means.
*  You know artificial general intelligence will be will emerge.
*  And who knows how that affects.
*  I've said publicly and I'm kind of half joking that we need A.I.
*  government.
*  You know it sounds crazy to say.
*  But instead of having this like alpha chimpanzee that runs the tribe of humans.
*  How about we have some like really logical fact based you know program that makes it like really reasonable and equitable in a way that we can all agree to.
*  Let's govern things in that manner.
*  Right. So you can actually simulate this today because you can go on these systems.
*  Shed GPT or Claude or these others.
*  And you can ask you know how should we handle issue X.
*  How should this be.
*  Yeah we've done that.
*  Right. How should the Department of Energy do whatever nuclear policy or whatever.
*  And what I find when I do that is I discover two things.
*  Number one of course these things are these things have the same problem.
*  Social media said which is they're tremendously politically biased and that's on purpose and they need to fix that and that's going to be a big topic in the next several years.
*  But the other thing you learn is if you can get through the political basically bias and censorship if you can actually get to a discussion of the actual issue it's you get very sophisticated answers.
*  Yes.
*  Right. Very logical very straightforward and it will explain every aspect of the issue to you and it'll take you through all the pros and cons.
*  Yeah.
*  And you know.
*  I mean it might be the way to go.
*  Which is so horrifying for people to think because everyone's worried about the Terminators taking over the world.
*  And like if that's the first step as we let them govern us.
*  Well there's nothing stopping a politician from using this.
*  There's nothing stopping a policymaker from using it as a tool.
*  Right.
*  You start out at least you start out using it as a tool.
*  There's nothing to prevent.
*  You know like for example I think military commanders in the field are going to have basically a battlefield assistance that are going to advise the most strategy tactics.
*  Yes.
*  How to win conflicts and then it'll start to work its way up and then they'll be doing you know war planning.
*  And then if you're a general if you're a sergeant or a colonel or a general it's going to just mean you perform better.
*  Yes.
*  So maybe there's like you know the human sort of man machine kind of symbiotic relationship and you could imagine that happening more in the in the policy process and in the political process.
*  And there's also a control jets which are far superior.
*  They did.
*  Mike Baker was telling us about that they did the simulated dogfights and the A.I. controlled jets won 100 percent of the time over humans.
*  And there's a bunch of reasons for that.
*  And part of it is just simply the speed of processing and so forth.
*  But another big thing is if you don't have a human in the plane you don't have the spam in the can.
*  You don't have that you don't have the human body.
*  Yeah.
*  In the plane you don't have to keep a human being alive which means you can be a lot faster and you can move a lot more quickly.
*  And G forces much higher G forces.
*  Yeah.
*  And then there's no option for someone to go crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  That's also right.
*  Yes exactly.
*  It's no there's no human element.
*  Yeah.
*  You know which is a real element.
*  Yeah.
*  No look I think we're going to it's going to be common to have like Mach 5 drone you know jet drones within within a few years.
*  And you know there'll be a fraction of the size of the current you know manned planes which means you can have like a lot more of them.
*  And so you kind of want to imagine you know a thousand of these things like coming over the horizon right at you.
*  And it really changes.
*  It's actually I think it'd be very interesting.
*  It really changes the fundamental equation of war in the following sense fundamentally in the past the people who won wars with the people who had the most men and the most material.
*  Right.
*  You just need the most soldiers and you needed the most equipment.
*  And in this drone world that we're talking about it's going to be the people with the most money and the best technology.
*  Yeah.
*  So for example small states you know small advanced states like Singapore will be able to punch way above their weight and then kind of large sort of economically or technologically backwards.
*  That normally would have won will now lose.
*  And so it's going to it's going to be a recalibration and then it has the good news is you're not putting soldiers at risk.
*  Right.
*  So you have a lot less lot less stuff.
*  The bad news arguably is it'll be easier to get into conflicts because you're not putting soldiers at risk.
*  So there's going to have to be a recalibration of like when you actually like lean into an attack.
*  I'm sure you're aware of all this you know you AP disclosure jazz that you see on television.
*  The more I look into it the more I think at least a percentage of it a healthy percentage of it is bullshit.
*  And there's probably some government projects where they've developed some very sophisticated propulsion systems that they've applied to drones and that that's what these people are seeing.
*  And this is one of the reasons why they continually have sightings over secured military spaces like out in the eastern seaboard like there's areas over Virginia where they continually see them in San Diego.
*  They see them off the coast of San Diego where there's a place where you would test stuff like that.
*  Well so of course we know that that was the case for a very long time for sure from the 50s through the 80s because we the development of stealth was highly classified and the other 71 was brand new at one point.
*  And so you had these like you know alien you know you pay attention to that stuff.
*  Of course 100 percent.
*  Yeah.
*  And then and then and then by the way we're not the only ones.
*  And so I you know my speculation would be that a lot some of the military based stuff is you know the Chinese doing something similar.
*  And you know we got a glimpse into that with the balloon.
*  You know that was goofy though.
*  They got shut down but still the fact that the Chinese are flying surveillance balloons over American territory and they were able to slip through our early warning systems and just like you know later above military bases and like you know take lots of you know imagery and do whatever scans they do.
*  Yeah.
*  And like not literally nothing was happening and we didn't even know they were there most of the time.
*  And so like you know that's like a tip of the ice.
*  It feels like a tip of the iceberg kind of thing where if they were doing that there are probably other things going on.
*  Well I've read that someone had commented that similar things had happened during the Trump administration but they didn't tell Trump because they didn't want him to shoot them down.
*  Interesting interesting.
*  For the record I'm pro shooting them down.
*  Yeah I think you should probably shoot them down and take pictures of shit they're not supposed to.
*  There's not even people up there fucking shoot them down.
*  What's the problem.
*  Yes.
*  Do you think there are any of those that are not of this world.
*  I don't think there's any way to know from the outside.
*  Have you ever like pondered it late at night sitting on your porch staring up at the sky.
*  Of course.
*  Well it raises to you know raises to number one is there not a minute if it is you know did it recently get here have they been here for a long time.
*  You know they arrived five thousand years ago.
*  Thanks there are demons and angels.
*  You know I mean demons and angels.
*  Are demons and angels real.
*  It's like you know literally you know probably not but like certainly they're metaphorically real and are there kind of shades of gray between literal metaphorical.
*  Well the actions are certainly demonic and angelic right.
*  Actions of human beings mass things that happen in the world are uplifting or horrific.
*  Evil people doing evil things are possessed.
*  I mean they're they're possessed by something like something is going on.
*  Right.
*  And like you know what's right.
*  What's the dividing line between you know an actual supernatural force and then some sort of psychological sociological thing that's so overwhelming that it just takes control of people and drives them crazy.
*  Like you might as well call that a demon.
*  Yeah it's fascinating because like when you think about from theological turn like you think of it from a religious perspective you know people would apply.
*  What would a demon do.
*  What would angels do.
*  What is what is a what is the will of God and what is like the evils of the worst aspects of humanity.
*  You would you know you could apply them to so many things in the world but we're very reluctant to say that something is demonic.
*  Like even though it's clearly demonic like clearly inaction like this is what a demon would do.
*  A demon would possess people to gun down children.
*  Exactly.
*  You know and you know use drones to shoot down a wedding party.
*  A demon would do that.
*  Exactly.
*  So a friend of mine is a religious scholar teaches at Catholic Catholic University and he's a religious history scholar and he says that medieval people would have had a medieval people were psychologically better prepared for the era ahead of us with AI and robots and drones everywhere than we are.
*  Because medieval people took it for granted that they lived in a world with higher powers higher spirits angels demons all kinds of supernatural entities and they just it was just assumed to be true and in the world we're heading into that we're arguably already in.
*  You know there are going to be these new forces these new entities running around doing things and you know we're going to just we're going to struggle and we're going to you know we're going to catastrophize we're going to conclude you know like AI is the end of the world.
*  Yeah.
*  The medieval's would have said oh it's just another spirit like you know it's just another kind of entity.
*  Yeah it's better it's better than humans and some things with so are angels.
*  And so we're going to have to like change our mentality we're almost going to have to become a little bit more medieval we're going to have to open up our minds to the kinds of entities that we're dealing with.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  Which which also could help us actually deal with people like it may be maybe maybe maybe there's an explanatory way to think about human behavior here that seems less rational but might actually be more rational.
*  Well you express yourself very brilliantly and describing the current state of woke ideology as a religion.
*  Yeah that's right.
*  And that the way you described it was brilliant because you were saying that it has all the elements excommunication adherence to a very strict doctrine all these different aspects of it saying things that you everyone knows to be illogical and nonsensical but you must repeat it.
*  You know these things are indicative of people that are in cults or people that are a part of like a very like a serious fundamental religion.
*  Yeah.
*  Well I mean of course the big difference between woke and those traditional religions as woke has no concept of redemption.
*  Right.
*  No concept of forgiveness.
*  Right.
*  Which is a very evil religion.
*  You do not want that.
*  Well it's ill conceived right because it's like immature it's an immature religion.
*  Yes it's absolute it's inherently totalitarian it has to be because it can be permanently destroy people.
*  Yeah.
*  Woke also understands something that the Greeks understood which is that being ostracized and being put to death are the same thing.
*  And so when the Greeks sent somebody like Socrates to death they gave them the option of just leaving.
*  But the problem was really yes Socrates could have just walked out and left.
*  No kidding.
*  The reason that was considered equivalent sentences is because at that time if you were not a citizen of a particular city you would get killed in the next city.
*  You'd be identified as the enemy presumptively and killed.
*  So there was no way to survive without being part of your community.
*  And that's what the woke's figured out is you can do the same thing if you're able to like you know nail somebody on you know on charges of having done something you know unacceptably horrible then you make them toxic and all of a sudden they can't you know they can't have you know people you know they lose friends they lose family.
*  Yeah.
*  They can't get work you know before you know it like they're you know living you know severely diminished damaged lives.
*  Some people then go on to kill themselves.
*  I don't know if you've been paying attention at all to blue sky.
*  I have but I have multiple friends that have accounts on blue sky that are very sophisticated trolls and are pushing like the woke agenda to a satirical point like to like parody.
*  But like on the edge where you're not quite sure.
*  They'll say enough real things that make sense and talk about their own anxieties and personal issues with stuff and then say fucking ridiculous shit and it's fascinating.
*  I bet it works.
*  It does work.
*  That's what's so terrifying.
*  It's like all the outcasts of Twitter all the people that were like I can't take this a few of them come back which is wonderful.
*  I love when they come back.
*  I'm gone.
*  I'm going to go to blue sky.
*  Fuck you people like a bunch of them went to threads for a while like Stephen King he went to threads came right back.
*  They all come right back.
*  They can't the marketplace of ideas like OK you could go to like a fruit stand in the middle of the fucking desert and that's a marketplace or you can go to the farmers market where everybody's there.
*  Where are you going to go.
*  That's right.
*  You're going to go to the farmers market.
*  Tons of people.
*  It's a lot of fun.
*  A lot of activity.
*  Yes that fruit stands fucking barren and deserted.
*  There's no one there.
*  There's very few choices.
*  Yeah.
*  It's not fun.
*  And it's when when it's when when when they're back on Twitter because it's good for them because they want to proselytize.
*  And so they need an audience.
*  So they they win and then we win because it's really really fun to dunk on them.
*  But it's also weird for them to not want any pushback at all.
*  Like don't it isn't the whole thing supposed to be about an exchange of ideas like if you have a controversial idea and someone disagrees with it.
*  Don't you want to hear that position.
*  I know I do.
*  I want to hear it.
*  Even if I vehemently disagree with it.
*  I want to hear it.
*  I want to know where how do you how's your brain work.
*  How are you coming to these conclusions.
*  What makes you think this way.
*  Who are you.
*  What do you like.
*  I want to go on Instagram.
*  I want to look at your pictures.
*  I want to see what you're up to.
*  What are you doing.
*  You know.
*  We do you free time.
*  You know what you complaining about.
*  I want it's like it's a fascinating education on human psychology and to watch people express themselves publicly and then also be attacked publicly by strangers which never happens in the real world.
*  Like at scale.
*  The way it happens on social media.
*  And I think it's an amazing time for people to examine ideas.
*  If you can handle it.
*  Yeah.
*  My favorite term is marketplace of idea.
*  Yeah.
*  You could have a marketplace of ideas.
*  It's just going to be one idea.
*  So blue sky is a marketplace of ideas.
*  Sure.
*  Yeah.
*  Access the marketplace of ideas.
*  That final S makes a lot of difference.
*  Yeah.
*  But the thing about X is it really is diverse.
*  There's I follow tons of like kooky leftist progressive nutbags that like have bizarre takes on everything.
*  And they were 100 percent convinced that Kamala Harris is going to sweep all the swing states including Iowa.
*  They were all in and I was like this is wild.
*  Yeah.
*  Like is that going to happen.
*  Are they right.
*  Like this is crazy.
*  But it's they were 100 percent convinced.
*  And it's fascinating to see all these different kinds of people to see the Charlie Kirk's and you know the full on left wing kooks and see them all together.
*  Right.
*  You need that.
*  Yeah.
*  Look so one of the ways I think to think about this is all new information is heretical by definition.
*  Right.
*  So anytime anybody has a new idea it's a threat to the existing power structure.
*  So all new ideas start as heresies.
*  And so if you don't have an environment that can tolerate heresies you're not going to have new ideas and you're going to end up with
*  complete stagnation.
*  Right.
*  If you have stagnation you're going to go straight into decline.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  And I think this is that the aberrant nature.
*  This is the timeline split.
*  I think that I think the last decade has just been like a really weird aberrant time where things have not been working like they should.
*  And you know in 2015 Twitter called itself the free speech wing of the free speech party.
*  Right.
*  And Elon Elon has not like change.
*  Elon has restored it.
*  Right.
*  But he brought it back.
*  He brought it back to something that everybody thought was completely normal 10 years ago.
*  Yeah.
*  And I think I hope this last 10 years increasingly is just going to feel like a bad dream.
*  Like I can't believe we tolerated the level of repression.
*  Right.
*  And anger and you know emotional incontinence and you know cancellation campaigns.
*  Emotional incontinence is a great term.
*  Yes.
*  There has been a lot.
*  That's really what it's like.
*  It's like you're just diarrhea in your emotions.
*  Just spraying rage in all directions.
*  And so I you know I'm very at the moment at least very optimistic that there is a cultural change happening here that's even more profound than the than the political.
*  I have a lot of respect and also sympathy for Jack Dorsey.
*  I like him a lot as a human being.
*  I think he's a brilliant guy and I think he had very good intentions but he was a part of a very large corporation and he had an idea for a wild west Twitter.
*  He wanted to have two versions of Twitter.
*  He wanted to have the Twitter that was pre Elon where there's moderation and you know you can't dead name someone and all that jazz.
*  And then he wanted to have an additional Twitter that was essentially what X is now.
*  And he just didn't have the ability to push that through with the board and the executives and all the people that you know were fully on board with woke ideology.
*  So the experience that people like Jack have had running these companies in the last decade has been and I don't mean to let them off the hook for their decisions but just the lived experiences they say of what these people's lives have been like is just daily pounding.
*  Just every single day it's like meteor strikes coming down from the sky exploding around you getting attacked from every conceivable direction being called just incredibly horrible things being attacked from many different directions.
*  He's already left blue sky.
*  Well yeah so so that's it.
*  Ernie and Jack is the Jack then created this blue sky which is kind of exactly the opposite of anyway where he thought.
*  You know by the way you know the new the new name for it of course is Blue Cry.
*  Yeah exactly.
*  Yeah but he's also got you know look to his credit he's still trying and so he's got Nostra you know which is another another what is it is called Nostra N.O.S.T.R.
*  Okay it's just kind of new this is it's actually his third he's going to keep swinging.
*  Full credit full credit he's going to he's going to keep swinging and by the way full credit he supported Elon you know they've mixed up a little bit but by and large he's been very supportive and was very supportive at a key time.
*  Well I also found it fascinating that when there was any sort of a right wing branch of that stuff like gab or any of these they would immediately be infiltrated by bots as well like my friends that troll on blue sky.
*  But these are Nazis like these are Nazi bots these are people that would just spew horrible hate and then gab would be labeled oh this is where the Nazis go this is a right wing psychopath social media app.
*  Yeah and I think frankly I think you get the same thing if you start out if I think if you start out of really political on either side I think that's what you end up with.
*  Yes.
*  And so I just like that that doesn't seem to be an effective route to market.
*  It seems like you have you have to start from the beginning as a general purpose service but you need to have some sense of the actual guardrails you're going to have around.
*  By the way every social media service internet service that ever works there's always some content.
*  Yes restrictions because you can't have child porn you can't have violence you can't have terrorist recruitment.
*  Right.
*  And even the First Amendment there's like a dozen carve outs the Supreme Court has ruled on over time there are things like that that you can't just like say right.
*  I can't say let's go join ISIS and let's go attack Washington like it's just it's literally not allowed.
*  So there's always some controls but you need to have like a spine of steel if you're going to hold back the censorship pressure and you know there's basically a sub stack company I'm involved you know doing very well you know small.
*  I love sub stack.
*  Smaller than Twitter but doing extremely well.
*  Fantastic.
*  And they've done a great job I think of holding the line on this.
*  Yes.
*  And then obviously.
*  And it's an amazing resource there's so many brilliant people on sub stack.
*  Yeah that's right.
*  I love sub stack.
*  I get a large percentage of my news from sub stack.
*  That's right.
*  It's really good and it's so valuable and it's such a great place for people who are independent journalists and physicians and scientists to publish their ideas and actually get paid for it by the people who subscribe to it.
*  I think it's fantastic.
*  And there's lots of people on the far left and the far right.
*  Yes.
*  So you actually have the full spread of like when a far left person gets upset at where you know somebody working in the New York Times is mad because they're not far left enough they quit and they start a sub stack.
*  And sub stack welcomes them in.
*  Yes.
*  Which is which is why they don't devolve into a gab or something like that because it really is a platform.
*  It really does welcome all.
*  Well it's also very difficult to subvert in that same way because sub stack is essays.
*  Right.
*  You're reading people's essays and papers on things and like these are long form things that are very well in a lot of cases very well researched and it's not the kind of thing you just shitpost on.
*  Right.
*  You know there are comments but it's just like they don't hold the weight that the actual article holds.
*  Right.
*  So my partners my partners at work they've observed that I tend to be able to inflame situations from time to time.
*  I can tend to be provocative and get people really upset.
*  And so the rule they've asked me to comply with is I'm allowed to write essays for example in sub stack and I'm allowed to go on long form podcasts but I'm not allowed to post.
*  Really.
*  Right.
*  Exactly.
*  You have rules.
*  It's the rule it's the rule.
*  Now by the way I struggle I struggle against the rules because I can't I can't help myself.
*  Why do they want you to have rules.
*  Because otherwise I inflame people too much.
*  I drive people too crazy.
*  You do it on purpose.
*  Sometimes.
*  I mean sometimes you have to.
*  Sometimes it's unintentional.
*  Did you ever hear about when the entire continent when the entire country of India was mad at me.
*  No.
*  Oh I spent one night with the entire country of India basically wanted to kill me.
*  It was like it was it was incredible.
*  Oh my goodness.
*  What happened.
*  I mean I was in a Twitter debate with somebody back when I was just posting freely on Twitter and it was a debate about economics and the topic of colonialism came up.
*  And I made a comment in a long thread about you know colonialism and it turns out the Indians are still extremely sensitive about the topic of colonialism.
*  And I did not understand.
*  The mindset and the historical orientation and I tripped the line.
*  And I stayed up all night and I went hyper viral in every time zone in India.
*  Every hour there would be like an entirely new activation.
*  Well and I was like I was like front page headline news top of the hour TV news like all the way across India.
*  Yes it was like a I do not recommend this as an experience.
*  I by the way I learned how many incredible Indian American friends I have because they all rallied to my you know my side you know said he's he's not you know Marx not literally calling
*  for the recolonization of India like that.
*  Probably the language Barry as well.
*  Language and then just what I was just historical context.
*  Americans have a different.
*  We Americans experience history differently than almost everybody else.
*  History for us is just like stuff that happened in the past that doesn't matter anymore.
*  But a lot of other people around the world experience history is something that really still matters like really matters to their lives today.
*  Yes they just they live in history more than we live a deeper understanding of kind of how they got to where they were and the things that happened to their parents and grandparents.
*  Right.
*  And ancestors and so there's just it's just it's just you know I don't know if it's better or worse it's just a different way of experiencing reality.
*  Yeah.
*  Anyway I recommend learning that lesson not by enraging a billion people.
*  I experienced a small version of that recently because I said we shouldn't be using long range missiles on Russia.
*  OK.
*  And the Ukrainians like and Ukrainian bots a bunch of people came after me because I was saying like the Biden administration I was like fuck these people.
*  And then I think some people misconstrued that as fuck the Ukrainian people which I absolutely was not saying I was saying fuck whoever in the last days of the presidency's decide to escalate this war because it appears that that's what they've done.
*  It appears that they're leaving Trump of giant mass.
*  At the very least.
*  So the good news is I am allowed to go on podcasts.
*  In the theory it's it's your sub bring it up though because it's your sub stack thing it's it's because it's basically Mark you need you need to explain yourself in long form.
*  Yeah.
*  You can't just say a thing exactly to your example you can't just say a thing and have people extrapolate from it.
*  Right.
*  Extrapolate.
*  It's not their fault because you haven't.
*  It's your fault because you haven't explained it.
*  Right.
*  Right. And so if you write something long form or if you go talk for three hours at least you'll the context will be there and then if they want to get mad at you that's fine.
*  But you can point everybody to the transcript and it's clear that that's not what you meant.
*  Do you also think while you're writing how things could be misconstrued.
*  So let me like do a really good job of being very clear about this.
*  100 percent.
*  Yeah. You kind of have to.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Yeah. Like Jimmy Corsetti on the other day and he is an expert in ancient history and ancient civilizations and we had these fascinating subjects and one of them that came up was the Nazis and their fascination with the occult.
*  And so you had to like clearly say listen fuck Hitler.
*  OK. Can I be really clear.
*  Fuck Hitler.
*  Fuck the Nazis.
*  OK. I have not in any way.
*  OK. Now that we're clear let's talk about where the swastika came from.
*  Fuck Hitler.
*  Did I say fuck Hitler.
*  Let me say it again.
*  Fuck Hitler.
*  But the swastika is this ancient symbol and he's like talking about like why did the Nazis have this fascination with the occult and with ancient civilizations.
*  And so we got into it but it was like one of those things where it's like all right we're hitting the third rail everybody get your rubber boots on.
*  You know let's let's save everybody here.
*  I've got a friend in the entertainment business who is quite left wing but really likes World War Two documentaries.
*  Oh.
*  And so he'll be like yeah I saw this great documentary last night about Hitler and I'm like I bet you did.
*  You can't even have a copy of Mein Kampf in your house.
*  Oh a student.
*  This is actually one of the Stanford crazy stories.
*  A student at Stanford was reported to the disciplinary board the civil whatever discipline disciplinary board for reading a copy of Mein Kampf in the quad.
*  Oh my God that's so crazy.
*  Which is a book that's been you know assigned for.
*  You can buy it right now on Amazon.
*  80 years.
*  Yeah.
*  To college kids to like understand who these people were and like how to not do that again.
*  Yeah that kid was like nearly brought up in charges nearly expelled.
*  So wow.
*  That's that's yes this this is the world that I that I hope that we're leaving.
*  Well it's just an awful way to look at things.
*  It's it's so awful to think that if you read about someone horrible you support them.
*  Yeah that's right.
*  It's just so crazy like what how are we going to study history.
*  Yeah right.
*  And how are we going to and how are we going to prevent bad things from happening again.
*  Right.
*  If we can if we can't wrap our heads around why they happen the first time.
*  Especially something like the Nazis.
*  Like how are we how are we going to learn.
*  Like what happened.
*  Clearly 1920s Germany was very different than 1945 Germany.
*  What the fuck happened in 25 years.
*  So what we're essentially talking about is the year 1999 America versus 2024 America.
*  Imagine a shift of that magnitude so crazy that there's a Holocaust in 2024 and in 1999
*  everybody's just hanging out.
*  Yeah that's right.
*  Well you should probably study that.
*  You should probably not reprimand someone for reading a book on this.
*  That's right.
*  Yeah exactly.
*  Look the German people went along with it right.
*  And so yeah you know how did that happen.
*  How did that happen.
*  And how many you know did they.
*  Yeah it was their active agreement was a right agreement was there you know what.
*  What are the steps.
*  Yeah exactly.
*  Things go horribly wrong.
*  And how can we recognize those because those steps have taken place multiple times in
*  history recorded history.
*  We know about them.
*  So like if we see them happening today maybe we should stop it and nip it at the bud.
*  What better way than to read about when it already happened.
*  Yeah.
*  What are my observations about people talking about current events as we know
*  conclusively the prayer errors all had horrible moral problems disasters you know
*  catastrophes wars and all kinds they made all kinds of horrible mistakes.
*  But we are completely certain that in our time we figured it all out right.
*  We're 100 percent convinced that we have it all dialed in.
*  And the one thing I know for sure is people 50 years from now are going to look back on us
*  and they're going to say oh my god those people were awful.
*  One hundred percent.
*  Right.
*  Just it's but like in what way.
*  Right.
*  In what way are we horrible.
*  I mean certainly a lot of the way we treat each other is horrible especially with the
*  amount of information that we have available.
*  But it is fascinating also that if you you know I visited Athens last year's last year
*  and I got to tour the ruins and I was like I wonder when it all went south.
*  When did they when did they know this had fallen apart.
*  Like when when was it in the peak of everything.
*  They probably thought hey we have the most amazing sophisticated civilization that's
*  available on earth and we will maintain this.
*  This is we will be the center of intellectual discourse and the home of democracy.
*  This is us.
*  And then now now there's like shitty apartment buildings next to the Parthenon.
*  Like what happened.
*  Something horribly happened.
*  And we don't want to think that could ever happen to us today.
*  Right.
*  We want to think we're American motherfucker.
*  We're going to keep this bitch rolling forever.
*  Leonard Skinner free bird.
*  Let's go.
*  Second Amendment.
*  Come on.
*  And we're going to we think that it's just this is this is the future.
*  America is the shining star of the world and we're going to carry this on but probably
*  not.
*  Like historically I mean what is the longest running dominant civilization ever.
*  The Romans existed for what a couple thousand years.
*  Like how long did the Greeks run.
*  How long did the Egyptians.
*  The Egyptians might be the longest running.
*  Especially if you like take into account the possibility of alternative history timelines
*  where they'll you know like Egyptian hieroglyphs they have kings that go back 30,000
*  years.
*  Here it is.
*  Egypt and Mesopotamia.
*  There it is.
*  One estimate measuring the time of the first pharaohs the use of hieroglyph writing to
*  the native religion was replaced by Christianity.
*  Ancient Egyptian civilization endured for about three thousand five hundred years.
*  No I bet it was more than that.
*  Well the argument is just things just really didn't really change.
*  Right.
*  Like changes we understand historical change of the kind that we understand where things
*  actually change.
*  Right.
*  The way people live changes really kicked off with the Greeks.
*  And so that was sort of the default status.
*  Right.
*  Civilization for a long time.
*  The Greeks kicked off change as we understand it.
*  And then and then and then the Romans.
*  Do you know what the fish ponds.
*  The fish ponds the fish the Cicero's fish ponds.
*  No.
*  So the Roman Empire ran for you know in its sort of Roman Republican Empire and it sort
*  of helped what you consider as dynamic phase is sort of vital phase ran for a few you know
*  a few hundred years but maybe 400 years total something like that.
*  And towards the end as it was sort of falling or stagnating and increasingly starting to
*  fall apart.
*  Brenda Mines says when the rose got dangerous and nobody could quite explain why.
*  Right.
*  Which sounds familiar by the way.
*  Cicero was one of the great one of the great Roman statesmen and he wrote these letters
*  that we have in the letters he sends these letters to all of his aristocratic friends.
*  And the theme in the letters is that basically all of the actual competent capable citizens
*  of Rome are out in the countryside at their villas perfecting their fish ponds.
*  Right. They've pulled into themselves.
*  They've built themselves their own protected environments.
*  Right.
*  Right. Where they control everything and they're completely focused on ornamentation.
*  They're completely focused on their clothes and on their lifestyles.
*  Right.
*  Kardashians.
*  They're Kardashians.
*  I don't know if the Kardashians have their spots but if they did they would be
*  spectacular.
*  Amazing.
*  No doubt they would be the most amazing fishpond we have ever seen.
*  So he kept railing is like stop with the fishponds like stop working the fit like get
*  back out here rejoin the Senate like get back involved in the system.
*  Let's keep this thing from caving in.
*  Yes.
*  And I think it looks as you know the significance I think of you know Trump actually
*  talked about this in the campaign you know his version of this talking on the campaign
*  trails he's like look I could be off in a resort I own all these golf clubs many things
*  I could be doing in my life.
*  Of course.
*  And he's 78 years old.
*  He probably would like to do that.
*  Exactly.
*  Right.
*  And he's you know surrounded his family loves him and like you know grandkids and like the
*  whole thing.
*  And he's like look I'm not doing it because like I need I need I need to do this.
*  And it's interesting because you know he doesn't use you know he's not referencing
*  Cicero when he says that but it's it's that spirit right.
*  That Cicero talked about where you know when times get tough do the people who are in a
*  position to actually make positive change actually step up or not.
*  Right.
*  And I think we've had a pretty long stretch here where that hasn't been the case and I
*  think maybe with Trump and then I think also with Elon I think.
*  Yes.
*  Because he was the other guy right.
*  He for sure could.
*  What's a coalition right.
*  It's not just him it's Vivek Ramaswamy.
*  That's right.
*  Another guy by the way who could be kicking it on a beach somewhere.
*  100 percent.
*  Yeah.
*  Very successful and young and handsome.
*  Do whatever you want to do anything.
*  Yeah.
*  He's decided to go all in.
*  And then of course you have Tulsi Gabbard and you know you have J.D.
*  Vance who I think is brilliant.
*  You have all these brilliant people that are together which is very hopeful.
*  This is what we didn't see out of the Biden Harris campaign.
*  You know what we saw from Harris and Waltz you have Waltz this guy who's it seems like
*  he's a compulsive liar.
*  At the very least he's lied multiple times about fairly insignificant things.
*  You know like whether or not he was a head coach or an assistant coach and the lies have
*  always elevated him socially.
*  Right.
*  All the lies about his military service or at least implying that he served in a different
*  perspective in a different aspect.
*  And then there was Tiananmen Square.
*  Everything enhances his virtue.
*  This is not what anybody wants.
*  You want the opposite.
*  You know you want a guy like J.D.
*  Vance who served in the Marines and you know went to Yale comes from a single mother with
*  addiction problems rose from hard work and dedication to become who he is now.
*  That's the kind of guy that I like.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what we all would like.
*  Like OK that looks like a leader to me.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Well the Romans had this concept they took very seriously they called virtue.
*  Right.
*  And like did you did you.
*  There's a whole ranking by the way the Roman virtues and if you read them today you just
*  like want to burst out crying because you're just like oh my god I can't believe what we're
*  missing.
*  But like yes people with virtue people with virtue it's not just that they think that
*  they're good people or that they tell everybody they're good people they actually act on it
*  and actually step up.
*  Well this is what's missing from today's secular society right.
*  Like we don't have like a doctrine that encourages that sort of thinking and behavior and
*  rewards it publicly which religion does.
*  You know what true Christianity you know not subverted fucking giant arena Christianity
*  where the guys fly in private jets and has Rolls Royces and shit but actual like real
*  Christian people.
*  Right.
*  Well the Romans the Romans had gods I mean their virtues had gods.
*  Yeah.
*  And so they're like it was actually wrapped it was your point it was like encoded into
*  their religion it was wrapped up in their religion they knew exactly what was expected
*  of them they knew exactly what their ancestors expected of them they knew exactly what their
*  gods expected of them.
*  I recently read meditations again a couple of months ago.
*  I listened to it in the sauna but it's it's brilliant and it's amazing that this guy
*  Marcus Aurelius was thinking like this so many years ago and it's so it's so valid today
*  and it applies so well to modern life it's so so strange.
*  You know how brilliant this person was while he was running this incredible empire.
*  That he could write about human psychology and the value of forgiveness and you know
*  being true to yourself and constantly being truthful everywhere and everything you do
*  and all these virtues and all these the stoicism that he that he espoused.
*  It's it's so valuable today.
*  It's really remarkable that this person who was a leader was it 2000 years ago that his
*  words still ring true today.
*  Yeah you probably know he didn't write it for public consumption.
*  Right.
*  Yeah it was even more amazing.
*  His private notebook which is why it's so good probably.
*  Yeah because he probably wrote it for a sub stack.
*  He'd like wow people are going to hate on this.
*  Let me yeah yeah.
*  Let me let me you know let me preactively attack the people in the comments or subdue
*  them.
*  But he's like he's like he's he's he's lecturing himself like he's telling himself how to
*  act.
*  You know he's very very deep deep.
*  These are very deep important.
*  My favorite my favorite part of the meditations is there's a section where something like
*  you're going to wake up this morning and everybody's going to hate you and everybody's
*  going to lie to you and everybody's going to make dumb decisions and you're going to
*  be incredibly frustrated and you're not going to get any credit for anything and you have
*  to get up anyway.
*  Like that's all yes yes yes that's all true.
*  Right.
*  And you still have to get up and do your job.
*  And of course he's saying that to himself as the leader of Rome to himself exactly.
*  You know and what's in there is just like wow his life was not you know he's just like
*  again it's actually you know like the CEO some it's just like you're going to get
*  pounded like yeah if you're in these positions you're going to get pounded every day.
*  It's a it's just incredible.
*  And if you're operating out of it out of a true sense of virtue if you're operating out
*  of a true sense of like exercising your responsibilities you get up and do it anyway.
*  It's amazing how much it resonates.
*  It really is.
*  What's amazing how much so many ancient writings resonate.
*  You know there's so much valuable information just like in Sun Tzu's The Art of War or
*  in the Book of Five Rings.
*  You know there's so many ancient books that you read and you go first.
*  First of all I love reading them because I try to imagine what you know what is this
*  life like in like if you want to take like Miyamoto Musashi 1400 when did he live.
*  Miyamoto Musashi was like 1420s or something like that.
*  What's that like.
*  Like what is your life like.
*  What is what is the what is the view of the world when you you don't really have detailed
*  maps or you don't have any photographs you don't have any idea what the fuck is going
*  on in Europe unless you go there.
*  Like what is what is your version of the world like.
*  And then to see someone's words written down and you read them and try to just imagine
*  yourself in their perspective in their mindset.
*  Yeah that's right. Yeah.
*  And look I think if you're somebody like that or somebody like Marcus Aurelius you just
*  have this incredible sense of responsibility.
*  Yeah.
*  Like you the one thing you do have is a sense of purpose like you know exactly why you're
*  here you know exactly what your role is you know exactly how you're supposed to behave
*  you know exactly how you're supposed to basically gain glory how you're supposed to honor
*  your ancestors like it's just all you know exactly where you are in the community.
*  Right. Right.
*  You know right.
*  You have this like incredible sense of groundedness and rootedness.
*  And of course there's huge downsides to that which is it really cuts off your ability to
*  you know run off and you know you know go on American Idol.
*  Right. Like there's like a lot of things you can't do.
*  Right. But like yeah you know you know what you're supposed to do and you either do it
*  or you don't do it. And these days to have people like that we need people who choose
*  to be that way. Right.
*  Which is which is you know which is arguably harder right.
*  Given given all the choices that they actually choose to live that way.
*  Well not only that giving all the distractions that people face every day that keeps them
*  from sitting down writing a journal like that.
*  That's right. Yeah.
*  You know I mean back then there's not a lot of different things to entertain you with.
*  Correct. Yes you had to be maybe a little bit more serious because you couldn't you
*  couldn't have as much fun. My favorite my other favorite meditations Marcus really is
*  something is something like be the rocks on the shore at which the at which the waves
*  beat. Right.
*  Like yes like yes your job is to stand there like the rocks do and just the surf just like
*  keeps coming and keeps coming and keeps coming and your job is just like stand there and
*  take it. Imagine when it was like addressing the people back then to just yelling out into
*  these groups or speaking in front of all the leaders like.
*  And everyone's plotting to kill you.
*  There's also a lot of that going on.
*  Yes.
*  I mean how many times they try to kill Hitler.
*  Like everybody's trying to kill you.
*  If you're if you're running things.
*  All your generals are probably secretly wanting to become the king.
*  Yep. Yep. Exactly.
*  Yeah. All these surfers are waiting in the wings.
*  Easy lives. You know today today most of the killings happen metaphorically.
*  No although every now and then.
*  Yeah.
*  Alternative timeline.
*  Yes. Yes exactly.
*  That's right. That's right.
*  Yeah.
*  How fearful were you leading up to the election that it wouldn't go into the new timeline.
*  It was so weird because all the experts said it was 50 50 razor razor sharp.
*  You know it's this tiny little thing 80000 votes in eight counties.
*  And you know and then number one then it wasn't which means we can take all those experts
*  and just dismiss them forever going forward because they clearly have clearly have clearly
*  have no clue. So it's another set of people we don't have to listen to.
*  But I had this really interesting conversation that kept nagging at me with a senior Democrat
*  who's on his way out of of of politics.
*  And he said in the summer I said how how certain is what's your view.
*  And this person said Trump's going to win with 100 percent certainty.
*  Really. Mr. Democrat from a sort of purple state.
*  Right. So you know not New York or California but like a state with sort of maybe Arizona
*  broader cross section of people.
*  And this person basically said yeah.
*  Said look all you have to do is fly anywhere in the country into any purple place and go
*  into a second or third tier you know side city and take an Uber for 30 minutes land at
*  the airport take an Uber driver after 30 minutes come back and just ask the driver like
*  how's it going and who are they voting for.
*  And basically 100 percent of the time the answer is going to be Trump because people are
*  just people were just completely fed up.
*  They were just completely fed up.
*  And then there was the you know Kamala enthusiasm which this person said you know the Kamala
*  enthusiasm is like highly focused in New York and California which don't matter from an
*  electoral standpoint. Right.
*  So they're not going to decide anything.
*  But that is huge when it comes to media.
*  Oh sure of course. But that's that's the thing.
*  The self-reinforcing nature of the bubble.
*  This is what's actually so interesting with these media bubbles is that the people in
*  these media bubbles are not breaking out like this like they're getting deeper into this
*  sort of collective psychosis that they indulge in.
*  And part of it was getting excited about a candidate for which there was very little
*  popular support for once you got outside of these you know heavily blue states.
*  Yeah. And so it is in a lot of ways is the most obvious explanation the world which is
*  just people just fundamentally did not like the direction the country was going and they
*  were just fed up with it.
*  There's also this very bizarre arrogance of people that were certain that Kamala Harris
*  was going to win.
*  I'm sure you've seen the viral video of this lady who's a political analyst who talks about
*  going to the liquor store and buying a bottle of champagne.
*  All right. I saw that. Yeah.
*  I don't want to show it to the poor lady.
*  She's probably living in hell right now.
*  But I'm blue sky.
*  She's probably on this guy.
*  She might be on it. Well she was on X.
*  I think she deleted her profile.
*  But the poor lady I mean she but she was being very arrogant and she laughed and mocked this
*  man and said you do realize you wasted your vote.
*  That's right. That's right. That's right.
*  That's right. She left which makes her hard to feel sorry for.
*  That's right. It's like you were you were ready to mock this man.
*  But in her eyes it was all about reproductive freedom.
*  And she thought that that was under attack under the Trump administration and that women
*  were going to stand up and they're going to stop that because in her echo chamber that was
*  the case. Everybody was universally.
*  They all agreed.
*  We're universally on board with this idea that Trump is evil.
*  We got to get rid of them and women are going to vote and this is going to be fun.
*  But like who are you hanging out with lady.
*  You know you could hang out with a bunch of people that think baseball is awesome.
*  And then you know you run into someone from another country like what the fuck is baseball.
*  Like you got to realize there's a lot of people out there.
*  Yeah. And people really don't like being talked down to.
*  They really don't. And they don't like you mocking the fact that first of all nobody
*  wasted their vote.
*  Like that's not how it goes.
*  Like you don't waste your vote if you vote different and the other side wins.
*  It's not how the other side won.
*  That's all it is.
*  Like you're wasting the vote is a crazy way to look at it.
*  Like because I think also people look at things like tribal games you know like you know in
*  Texas is a huge football state and people love football.
*  And it's always we this we that when UT plays South Carolina we this we that.
*  It's like people love to be a part of a team that's winning.
*  And they apply that especially if they're not into sports to other things.
*  I think it's just a war mentality.
*  It's a tribal war mentality that's been sort of subverted in the human mind and applied
*  to other things.
*  It could be like Microsoft versus Apple.
*  You know it could be Android versus Apple you know iOS.
*  It's weird how people get so tribal and then connect their own personal identity to other
*  people agreeing with these ideas that they believe.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I know for two thoughts one is the Democrats for a long time were the big tent party.
*  So the Democrats were the coalition of people who had very different points of view on
*  things.
*  And of course you know famously it's all the different identity groups and it's all the
*  different you know economic unions and all these things.
*  And Republicans were like the party of like rigidity.
*  Right.
*  And just for whatever set of a lot of the woke stuff had a lot to do with it as it
*  flipped to where at least today Trump's Republican Party is the big tent party.
*  Yes.
*  To your point on having all these new people and many of whom are former Democrats.
*  A lot of them.
*  And the Democrats have decided to try to isolate out anybody right who disagrees on any
*  issue and demand right lockstep conformity through the cancellation process.
*  And so that that's a very interesting inversion that happened kind of without anybody
*  saying anything about it.
*  But it did happen.
*  And then I think the other the other inversion was the economic conversion which is
*  remember the criticism of the Republican Party for a long time was it was the party of
*  trickle down economics.
*  Yes.
*  The idea was rich people are going to get all the money.
*  Reagan got taxes Reagan administration and then basically if poor people get any money
*  it's going to be because the rich people like trickle trickle some.
*  Right.
*  I think that inverted to where the Democrats especially in the last four years became the
*  trickle down party which was we're going to tax and we're going to collect all the money
*  and give it to the government and then we're going to let the government hand it out.
*  Right.
*  But they did it under the guise of tax the rich.
*  They did it.
*  They did it with this Robin Hood mentality.
*  At least they expressed.
*  Of course that's how it starts.
*  But then you end up with thirty five trillion dollar federal debt.
*  You end up with this giant annual deficit and then you end up with all this money being
*  handed out right.
*  Handed out and all these grants and all these things like just this this like shower of
*  money coming from the government.
*  But of course if the government is giving you money it also means the government can
*  take money away.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  If you're making somebody dependent on you because you're giving the money then you're
*  in a tremendous position of power because you can make their life horrible by pulling
*  the money away.
*  Right.
*  You can also control their ideology that way.
*  100 percent.
*  Yeah.
*  You own them.
*  Like it's actually a form you know it's on this it's on the spectrum to a form of like
*  domination.
*  Right.
*  You know that should make us very uncomfortable.
*  And so that and you know maybe that would be fine if the debt if the debt and the deficit
*  didn't have the control and inflation didn't get out of control but it did.
*  And then at that point it's like OK like this this new kind of sort of tax and spend
*  driven trickle down economics is clearly not sustainable it's not going to work.
*  So the way the Trump administration is going to approach the economy they want less
*  regulation.
*  They want tariffs and less regulation and they want more more reliance on U.S.
*  energy.
*  Right.
*  They want to drill more more natural gas more fracking more drilling for oil and then
*  allow companies to to work without regulations inhibiting their performance.
*  This will boost the economy.
*  You'll have more productivity.
*  You have more American manufacturing.
*  You have more things happening.
*  Yeah. So the two headline things you hear from them whenever they talk about this
*  headline things are number one growth.
*  You just need faster growth.
*  But by the way it's the only way to resolve the long term fiscal situation it's the
*  only way to resolve the debt.
*  There's only two ways to do it.
*  You can inflate your way out of it and end up in 1930s Germany with hyperinflation like
*  that. That's one track you can get on which is a very bad track and you don't want to
*  go there or you can grow faster because if you grow faster then your your economy can
*  catch up to the debt and you can you can pay down the debt as you grow.
*  And so they want to go for a higher rate of growth.
*  And then the other thing is they want America to win.
*  And this is my partner Ben and I were able to spend time with Trump this summer and that
*  was like his like adamant thinking kept going back which is like look America has to
*  win. And specifically what that means is America has to win in business and in
*  technology and in industry generally globally.
*  Like our companies should be the ones that win these broad.
*  We should win global markets like our company should be it should be the goal.
*  How can anybody be against that.
*  I happen to think that makes a lot of sense.
*  Yes I know.
*  I mean obviously you're a wealthy man and I am as well but it's like how could you
*  not want that.
*  Yes by the way if you are in favor of a high level of social support if you want
*  there to be lots of welfare programs and food assistance programs all these things
*  I would argue you also want that because it's the growth that will pay for all the
*  social programs.
*  Right. Like that's how you square the circle.
*  That's how you actually have your cake and eat it too which is like first you view
*  your economy just generates a fountain of money through through growth and economic
*  economic success and then you can pay for it and you can pay for whatever programs
*  you want. I actually don't personally like I'm totally fine like set up all the
*  programs you want all the social spending while all the safety nets you want.
*  And if as long as it's easy to pay for because you're growing so fast then
*  everybody wins.
*  Yeah. I mean I've always said if I knew that I paid more taxes people in the world
*  in this country would live better.
*  I would do it.
*  Right. Of course.
*  I just don't believe that they're good at spending it.
*  That's the thing right.
*  It's like if you're putting in this if you've generated 35 trillion of debt and
*  these are the results.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah. Like this this is not the deal.
*  And this is my friend that I talked about earlier that that was the point he made
*  is just like look the deal has been broken like this is not the deal anybody signed
*  up for. This is not how it's supposed to work.
*  Everybody knows it.
*  And when you were talking about giving people social programs and giving them
*  benefits and then you could take that away at any moment.
*  This was one of the big fears that people had about letting illegal immigrants into
*  the country and moving them to swing states which clearly happened and also giving
*  them a bunch of benefits which clearly happened money food stamps housing all that
*  happened stuff that wasn't available to veterans stuff that wasn't available to
*  homeless people wasn't available to the very poor of this country.
*  All of a sudden people came here illegally got those things.
*  That's right.
*  And the thought was if you gave these people these things and you gave them a way
*  better life look if I was living in a third world country with a family and I knew
*  that I could come to America and I could get a job an actual job and make money
*  and my family's going to definitely eat.
*  I'll vote for whoever the fuck you want me to vote for.
*  I don't care.
*  My life is infinitely better than it was in this totalitarian shithole that I was
*  in until I walked here.
*  I'll do whatever you want.
*  I just want my family to survive and I think everything's going to it's so much
*  better than where I was if I'm in some war torn part of the world.
*  It's so much better here.
*  I don't care if the Democrats win or the Republicans.
*  I'm in America.
*  And if the Republicans didn't give me any money and they want to get me out they
*  want to deport me.
*  But this nice lady she gave me an EBT card and I'm staying at the Roosevelt Hotel
*  in New York City and I get a flight somewhere else where I want to go there.
*  Oh this is wonderful.
*  Right.
*  So that's how it starts.
*  And there is a lot of that going on.
*  But I will say what's one of the things that's interesting is it doesn't
*  necessarily stick that way.
*  And the sort of evidence for that is the rapid sort of dramatic ramp up in the
*  Hispanic vote for Trump.
*  Well Hispanic people generally are very hard workers.
*  So this gets this gets to the thing.
*  So I'll just tell you a quick story on this.
*  So after the night after the 2016 election like literally everybody I knew
*  was just like completely traumatized like we were all just like completely
*  freaked out everybody was shocked.
*  You were freaked out.
*  Yeah I was completely freaked out.
*  Everybody was freaked out.
*  Like I didn't expect him to win the nomination.
*  I didn't expect him to win the race like and you know the media is on like full
*  historical blast and it's the end of the world and he's you know he's a Russian
*  spy all this crazy stuff that we don't know not to be true.
*  It's just it's just like full on.
*  So a group of us a group of us went out to dinner at a restaurant Palo Alto and
*  you know the atmosphere was like a funeral.
*  I mean like everybody in the restaurant was just like despondent like ready to
*  ready to slit their wrists.
*  And so we're sitting there eating and like the food doesn't taste good.
*  You know it's just like can't taste the food you can't taste the drinks like
*  everybody's just depressed.
*  Wow.
*  And you know it gets this thing of like you know my you know my god I can't
*  believe that you know Trump you know this that you know you see you know
*  racist anti-Hispanic and all this stuff.
*  And it was it was it was one of those moments where the young waiter who's you
*  know Hispanic young man in his 20s one of those rare moments where he broke into
*  the conversation at the table.
*  Right.
*  But it was in context it was like oh thank God because like we're just we're
*  just depressing ourselves to death.
*  So like thank God he's going to say something.
*  And he said you know I think you guys are looking at all wrong.
*  He's like my father thinks Trump is fantastic.
*  My father came here as an immigrant whatever 30 years ago built a life here
*  became a citizen bought into the system pays taxes like raised a family.
*  Moan is long with a MAGA hat on.
*  He thinks this guy is great.
*  He thinks this guy is fantastic and he voted for him and he just has and and
*  and and then you know you for this before but then it's like and the thing
*  that this guy said the thing my father thinks is terrible is if other people
*  are able to come here they're able to cut in line.
*  You know they didn't have to go through the process they didn't have to prove
*  anything they're not bought into the system.
*  Right.
*  They're they're able to jump in and then they you know they don't know they're
*  not buying into the system and you know part of it maybe they're not being
*  accepted but also part of it is they're not buying in they're not they're you
*  know they're not they're not assimilating they're not becoming part of
*  the you know of what makes America America.
*  And you know in some cases and by the way in some cases you know the criminals
*  are coming across and terrorists are coming across gangs.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's like my father's not in favor of any of that.
*  Right.
*  Right. My father wants to be part of a great society of a great America not
*  some dysfunctional you know basically just disaster zone.
*  And I remember the group of us it was my first glimmer of like OK I need to like
*  completely rethink my whole sense of like how the world works because one
*  conversation.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Well it was it was weird because it was like so.
*  So what happened to me is like I grew up in rural Wisconsin which is now like
*  completely Trump country.
*  And so from like zero to 18 like I completely understood the mentality and I
*  was always like explaining to my friends of like no no like this is you know this
*  is like a different place and people think differently.
*  And then somehow between the ages of like 18 and 40 or whatever I just like
*  forgot and I became a Californian.
*  I became I became a fully assimilated Californian and I was just like well of
*  course the Californians are much more sophisticated and advanced than right.
*  And people you know where I came from.
*  And so of course of course of course everybody in California.
*  Has it figured out.
*  And of course California is going to leave leave the country and of course in all
*  this thinking right.
*  And Trump was for me Trump was the Trump 2016 was the wake up call of like no no
*  no no no like that's just like completely that is such an impoverished worldview of
*  how this country works and how people think that it doesn't explain what you
*  because you have to explain what happened and then you have to like if you have
*  some sense of being able to predict what's next which is what I'm supposed to
*  be doing for a living.
*  You know investing is supposed to be.
*  It's like OK I got to rebuild my entire model of the world for like how this all
*  works and how this whole system how this country works.
*  But it was that conversation that kick started it for me.
*  So what was the process of altering your perspective or at least opening it up.
*  Yes. So for me it was primarily it was reading.
*  And so I started actually read my way back in history and I went I actually went all
*  the way back. I tried to read of like where the origins of like left wing thought
*  came from and then communism and how did that evolve.
*  And you know liberal democracy and then also right wing thought and like you know
*  everybody's calling everybody fascist now.
*  So like what was fascism.
*  Is that what this is.
*  Right. How did how did the Germans do with it.
*  You know so all all of those questions and then you know kind of converging on in
*  the last 80 years like how was that you know either stabilized or not stabilized.
*  And so I did that. But the other thing is I just started talking to a lot more
*  people and I just stopped assuming that because I read it in the New York Times
*  that it was true.
*  And you know and by the way and then of course what unfolded in the years you know
*  kind of sense was you know the whole.
*  I followed the whole Russiagate thing like super closely like I read every thing
*  and I read all the reports.
*  What did you think initially did you think it was true.
*  It's like this overwhelming consensus from the entire expert class that of course
*  he's a Russian spy.
*  I sat on stage I went to Hillary's first post-election loss speech which she gave
*  at Stanford the very first one and I sat we know that people organizing it so we
*  sat literally like 15 feet from from from Hillary in her first appearance.
*  The whole thing is fraught with just like incredible tension because and the
*  Russiagate stuff is in full full blown full blown display and I go there and I'm
*  like all right this is going to mean to me and you know in the audience of
*  Stanford audience and so it's all 100 percent Hillary Clinton supporters.
*  Right.
*  And I'm sitting there and I'm on my best behavior because I'm with my wife and I
*  have to like not you know I have to not act out.
*  And Hillary gets up there and she says Trump is only president today because
*  Vladimir Putin hacked Facebook and made him the president.
*  Right.
*  And I'm sitting in the audience and I'm like on the Facebook board and I'm like
*  that's not like that's not true.
*  I know for an absolute fact that that's not true.
*  Right.
*  And so that got me thinking and then the Russiagate stuff unspooled and I was like
*  you know the whole the the the the steal dossier and like all this stuff comes out.
*  What was the accusations about Facebook.
*  How did she think that Russia hacked Facebook and made Trump the president.
*  Yeah. So it's this whole thing with this.
*  Remember this whole thing Cambridge Analytica.
*  And so it's this whole thing that there was this basically there was this data
*  there was this theory which by the way is like completely it is like a completely
*  fake thing like this didn't.
*  So there was this date there was this there was this data set on user behavior
*  that in theory there's academic there's a theory that you could sort of impute
*  human behavior from this data set and then you could use it to predict what
*  people would do and how they would react to different kinds of messages.
*  And it was like this like magical breakthrough and basically thought control.
*  And then there was this company called Cambridge Analytica in the UK that
*  figured out a way to do this.
*  And then it was this like new kind of literally like mind control like you know
*  by far like the most powerful meme weapon of all time for getting people to vote
*  the way that the way that you want.
*  And it was this data breach of face.
*  The whole thing was weird because Facebook had been criticized for a decade leading
*  up to 2016 that it kept all the data closed.
*  Right. So the criticism was Facebook nevertheless any of the data it doesn't
*  share the data right.
*  And the criticism for years was Facebook is the Rocha Motel of data and the
*  virtuous thing for it to do is to actually free the data and let everybody else have
*  access to the data.
*  And then in 2016 flipped 180 degrees and it was Facebook is the most evil company
*  of all time because it let Cambridge Analytica get access to this data.
*  And then Russia ran basically a psychological operation on the American
*  citizens.
*  Why didn't Facebook push back.
*  They did.
*  They did early on.
*  They do today in their way.
*  But you know they're trying to run a business.
*  They're trying to get to the next quarter.
*  They're trying to keep the employee base and everybody copacetic.
*  They're trying not to get just completely destroyed by the politicians.
*  They're getting slammed every single day on every conceivable issue you can imagine.
*  And it's actually very interesting when you're in these companies like these big
*  issues are big issues but you're also literally trying to like make the quarter.
*  Right. You're right.
*  You're trying to ship your products.
*  You're trying to close your sales.
*  You're trying to keep your employees from quitting.
*  Right. You have these you have responsibilities.
*  Right. You have practical concern responsibilities.
*  And so sometimes these companies get kind of wedged because they can't do the
*  things that they would do if they were just in damage control mode.
*  And then they write and then they you know then they maybe the message doesn't
*  get out. But so what was a bigger shift the waiter or the Hillary speech.
*  Oh it was the waiter. I mean by that it was the waiter was the much bigger shift
*  because it was listening to a normal person listening to a person with their feet on
*  the ground actually explaining the way the world worked.
*  Whereas with Hillary it was it was cope.
*  Right. It was it was delusion.
*  She then it was it was amazing by the way she then spent the next hour and a half
*  when I when I when I'm in a place where I don't know if I'm going to control
*  myself I bring a little notepad along because I can work out my demons like
*  on Dix.
*  So that I don't so that I don't say anything.
*  Right. Like super bad.
*  So I brought my little notepad on my little little Fisher space pen right.
*  I pulled out and I started making a list of all of the people and organizations
*  that she blamed for her defeat that were not named Hillary Clinton.
*  And I got to 20.
*  My favorite was Netflix by the way.
*  She blamed Netflix.
*  What did Netflix do.
*  Netflix aired anti-clinton documentaries.
*  Oh this is facts.
*  Well this is particularly funny because the CEO of Netflix is a famous Democrat.
*  He's a super Democrat.
*  Mr. Well not actually dead but also specifically Reid Reid.
*  Reid Hastings and his wife are very enthusiastic left wingers.
*  But I mean it was just this litany of you know basically excuses and complaints
*  right with no sense of like responsibility personal responsibility at all.
*  You know just like pure grievance.
*  And so it was the negative it was negative lesson like OK like whatever that is is
*  not the path.
*  Like did she blame Comey.
*  Oh yeah. Oh absolutely.
*  Oh yeah. She absolutely hated that guy.
*  Yeah. No question.
*  That was a wild one.
*  Hundred percent. Yeah exactly.
*  And by the way like that was super weird.
*  Yeah. You know I don't think she was completely wrong.
*  I don't understand that one.
*  Honestly if they didn't want Trump to win I don't get that one.
*  Well she's good. We know she's guilty but we're not going to charge her.
*  Right.
*  Is it weird.
*  That's crazy. Is it weird message.
*  It's almost as weird as the Biden one where we don't think he's competent to stand
*  trial for the documents that he had that were classified.
*  Exactly.
*  But he can what have his finger on the button.
*  The fuck are you talking about.
*  Exactly.
*  We know we know he's guilty but we never can victim because the jury would say
*  that he's a senile old man.
*  Which is crazy because he's still running for president at the time he's running
*  for reelection.
*  Well then remember everybody at the time said the media said that the prosecutor
*  is lying.
*  Right.
*  Because we at that point sharp as a sharp as a.
*  Attack.
*  My favorite is Joe Scarborough.
*  This is the best Biden intellectually the best one I've ever seen like dude.
*  Yes.
*  And then meanwhile he had to go to Mar-a-Lago and kiss the ring.
*  Yes exactly.
*  Exactly.
*  Exactly.
*  My favorite was the remember the about about earlier this year was the invention
*  of the term cheap fake cheap fake cheap because everybody's worried about the AI
*  deep fake which really didn't.
*  Then there was really nothing nothing happened to that.
*  And so the cheap fake we learned is a video that just simply shows you something.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  It's claimed to be out of context but it actually turns out that it's actually just
*  telling you the truth.
*  Didn't Nancy Pelosi start using that one cheap fake.
*  Yeah exactly.
*  Because the theory was it was going to be clips out of context.
*  Yeah.
*  But it turned out there were clips in context.
*  Have you seen there's a gentleman who made a video here.
*  I'll send it to you Jamie because I sense Duncan.
*  It's pretty fucking crazy of what a is capable of now by.
*  Come on.
*  On my phone updated you son of a bitch.
*  Come on.
*  Don't make me go to fucking Android because I will.
*  This guy did this insane video where it's all completely AI and everything he did
*  including his voice.
*  It's here.
*  I'll send it to you Jamie.
*  It's 100 percent AI generated and it's so hard to believe because it's so good.
*  And it really puts you in this when you're talking about cheap fake.
*  I just sent it to Jim cheap fakes and deep fakes.
*  Let's put the headphones on to watch this because it's so crazy.
*  We're at that moment where you cannot tell.
*  Right.
*  And let's look at this one because it's pretty extraordinary.
*  This is the best version that I've seen so far.
*  This is completely AI.
*  To speak like me.
*  One of our companies.
*  Okay.
*  Text and it will sound like me.
*  Then I trained Hey Jen with a video of mine.
*  I input the audio file to generate a video based on my text.
*  The video you are watching right now is the result.
*  One hundred percent generated in AI.
*  What do you think of that?
*  Guys I know this might sound crazy.
*  How crazy is that?
*  Oh that's your company.
*  That's him.
*  Oh that's him.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  That is that's the AI generator.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  That's right.
*  That's right.
*  That's right.
*  So that's two companies.
*  One of one of them is the voice is ours.
*  And then that's another great company called Hey Jen.
*  They did the visuals.
*  But yeah.
*  No that's right.
*  That's not.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Well this is part of the first internet.
*  There was a first internet election.
*  Probably the first internet election will be the one that has this kind of thing actually in it where people get tricked.
*  Why didn't they do that with Kamala Harris?
*  Turns out they had done an amazing job.
*  Like really knocked it out of the park with a solid speech.
*  They didn't.
*  Just have her say it on the internet.
*  Yes.
*  Just have a bunch of viral videos of her speaking so eloquently and perfectly.
*  One would think exactly.
*  That's the fear of the future right.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And so like I think that's that's going to be the kind that's going to be the kind of thing is going to happen in terms of like the dirty trick side.
*  I think that you know that will be a part of it right.
*  There's always some way to try to try to game these things.
*  Just have the most brilliant writers formulate you know get a eye to do it like you're saying AI has all these solutions to things that are super logical.
*  And well there's no like weird thinking in it.
*  So you know cut all the fat out.
*  So I think we have a theory on how to fix this.
*  And the theory basically is we're going to have to switch our sense of what's real from basically just trying to eyeball it and figure out whether it's real to only take
*  taking seriously the things that we know are real.
*  And the way that we would know things are real as well have them registered registered on the block chain.
*  Right. And so I think the way this is going to work in the future is every politician will have an account on a block on a block on a block chain service like a crypto crypto service.
*  And then every politician whenever they say anything in public whenever they're going to have people around them with cameras all the time whenever they put out a statement they're going to cryptographically sign it on the block chain so that it can be validated that it is actually content from them.
*  And then I think we're just going to have to reach an understanding that we're just going to have to write off everything else that we see.
*  Which frankly is a good idea anyway because there just is a lot of noise in the environment.
*  How would you integrate that with social media though because one of the one of the issues is these low information voters that are getting information either from click bait headlines on these websites where they don't even read the actual paragraph with Mike which might be completely different than the headline itself.
*  The headline is just inflammatory and then viral videos like how would you.
*  So the thing is so that's already happening even pre A.I. right.
*  And so I would say that's that's a pre existing problem.
*  And so we can't we can't.
*  By the way that's been happening for a long time.
*  Newspapers have been scandal sheets forever.
*  If you go back hundreds of if you go back hundreds of years to the first newspapers they were running all kinds of scrolls.
*  The first newspaper was a scandal sheet to the Vatican like really your 1500.
*  It was all these like terrible rumors about like the pope and the bishops and all these cardinals.
*  That was the first newspaper.
*  That was the very first newspaper was in the Vatican and then the American all the American colonial newspapers were like that in the revolutionary era.
*  It was all crazy rumors and innuendo and people accusing each other of there was a famous election in 1800 which was Jefferson versus Adams that we think of as these like super upstanding you know upright people and they're just like smearing the crap out of each other in their respective newspapers.
*  Because they would actually own newspapers in those days.
*  Oh God.
*  Attack each other.
*  More things change.
*  Ben Franklin Ben Franklin Ben Franklin printed newspapers before he became a became when a government and he created 15 different sock puppets.
*  He created 15 different pseudonyms.
*  He was he was a sued or a non.
*  And then he would basically have them argue with each other in his newspaper without telling people that it was all him.
*  So he had all these different personalities.
*  And so like we've been in a world of like information warfare for a very long time.
*  We've been in a world of sensationalist you know nightly news.
*  If it was a if it bleeds it leads.
*  Yeah you know sensationalist stuff for a long time.
*  We've been in a world of like propaganda for a long time.
*  So so that you know that that you're not going to think that you're never going to make that go.
*  But isn't it funny that we don't think of the past like that.
*  Oh yeah.
*  We just assume virtuous and we assume they had it all figured out.
*  Yeah.
*  That very much is not true.
*  There is all kinds of crazy crazy banana stuff.
*  My favorite is in the Vietnam War.
*  What was it was the the Gulf of Tonkin that sort of kicked off the sort of big escalation.
*  If you like we now know for a fact it didn't happen.
*  Right.
*  With the whole thing just didn't happen.
*  And now there's this big debate about like did they know it didn't happen or did they fake it.
*  But like so there's always been stuff like that in history.
*  So that we can't fix.
*  And I will be a new way to do that kind of thing.
*  But what we can do is we can reorient people to say OK now you're going to have to like take seriously this stuff is real.
*  And if you want to actually know what's happening this stuff is real and we can prove that it's real.
*  And if it's not it's entertainment and you can choose to believe it or not.
*  Right. But you should not rely on it.
*  And look it's not going to be perfect and it's going to take time.
*  But there is there is a way to address this.
*  OK. So that would be the solution to deepfakes the block chain.
*  Yeah. You flip it. You flip it.
*  Yeah. That's the real stuff.
*  That's logical.
*  That actually does make sense.
*  That that actually kind of gives me hope.
*  I do generally have hope even though I look at the pessimistic side of things I'm generally optimistic because my real feeling about human beings is most people are good.
*  I genuinely believe there's far more good people in the world than bad people.
*  There's far more people that just want to live a good life and have a good time and enjoy themselves than there are people who are tyrants.
*  Yeah. I'm super optimistic.
*  I'm incredibly optimistic.
*  And I was optimistic already with flashes of pessimism but like I'm really optimistic and especially now.
*  So I think this is going to be we have the real we have the real potential here for Golden Age.
*  We really do. We really do.
*  Yeah. The capabilities that we have and the people that we I mean look in my day job.
*  I meet these young you know I meet these 22 year olds every day that are just like the smartest people in the world.
*  The smartest people I've ever met.
*  I think they're getting better by the way as time passes.
*  They're by the time they're 22 they just know a lot more.
*  They have so much more access to information than we did.
*  Yeah. They're so much better trained capable and ready to go.
*  Yeah.
*  Fired up and they know each other able to connect online and they're already in communities and they know how to help each other.
*  And so like yeah the productive and inventive creative aspect particularly of this country is just like there's never been anything like it in the world.
*  I think there's also the real potential for a shift in perspective a positive patriotic shift in perspective that can happen in this country.
*  And if you think about what happened with the woke ideology how it swept so quickly over the country and changed so many aspects of the way we deal with things socially.
*  It happened so radically and so quickly and such a large change that people are susceptible to change.
*  It's possible to to enact change and a positive change in a good direction where people are optimistic about the future which you are and I am.
*  I mean I think that's probably contagious.
*  Yeah that's right.
*  I really do think that it's an upward spiral.
*  It was Evan Hafer who said that thing about psychology the other day.
*  It was one of his a friend of mine who was a former special forces guy said that psychology is more contagious than the flu.
*  Right. Right. Exactly. Yes. Yes.
*  Yeah. Yeah I think that's right. So one of the interesting things that's going to happen right now you know we talked a lot about Trump's victory and Republicans but there is now a civil war that's kicked off inside the Democratic Party which is very interesting because they lost so badly.
*  Right. Right. So the fact that they lost the White House and they lost the popular vote and they lost the Congress and they lost the Senate and they lost the Supreme Court.
*  Right. Like this time it's undeniable that like the current path that they've been on is not working like it's your foot like being an exclusionary party and kicking people out for wrong thing like it's not.
*  They're not going to win elections. They're not just kicking people out there barring people from making it to the primaries.
*  Yes. Which is very undemocratic.
*  That's right. That's right. Yeah exactly. Starting with Bernie in 2016 and then right continuing so.
*  Donna Rice's book she documented that.
*  Right. Right. And so so like I would say the smart Democrats know that this is not it's not a viable path. You can't have a political party that doesn't win. It doesn't make it's not it's not useful.
*  And so there's going to have there's a civil war that's underway inside that party that's kicking off right now where they're going to have to recalibrate decide what they want their future to be and it's going to be a big decision.
*  And the same thing happened by the way when Reagan beat Carter really badly in 80 and then and then and then had a landslide in 84.
*  It then took Democrats 12 years right to get to Bill Clinton and actually win again.
*  And so they have this cautionary tale of they went too far in the 60s and 70s and it took them 12 years to recover.
*  And so if you talk to the like really smart Democrats right now they're like look this can't be 12 years. That's crazy. We have to do this a lot faster but we have to reorient and we have to get back to common sense.
*  We have to get back to normal. We have to get back to sensible. We have to get back to moderate.
*  We were actually playing Bill Clinton debating during the elections of what year was that Jamie.
*  I forget which was when he first ran what year did he first run.
*  Oh yeah. Oh 92 92. So is the night. And I'm like I vote for that guy. Yeah exactly. Heartbeat.
*  It goes awesome. Also we played a clip of Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton where she sounded more maga than anybody who's maga today.
*  She was talking about the penalties that illegal immigrants should face.
*  They should pay a stiff fine because they came into this country illegally.
*  And if they're a criminal they should be jailed or kicked out of the country without question. Like all this was like so maga.
*  I was like this is so wild to hear from Hillary in 2008.
*  That's right. That's right. And Hillary and Joe Biden and what Dianne Feinstein and all these people wanted to build a wall.
*  Uh huh. That's that Dianne Feinstein our senator in California at the time very you know very left wing.
*  She was down on the border like to photo ops in front of the wall that was being built like trying to take credit for it.
*  Crazy. Yeah yeah like 18 years ago. Yeah.
*  And so yeah so another reason for optimism is I think that they're going to be able to pull their way back.
*  Like I think they're going to be able I think getting losing this bad is very motivating to be able to pull your way back and become more normal.
*  And I think again that would be like I mean how great would it be if you had two parties that actually had like sense.
*  Yes. Normal normal.
*  I mean imagine if Clinton was running up against Trump. Yes exactly.
*  Like he was so good.
*  We played that speech that he gave after sister sister soldier.
*  It's had a bunch of like very anti white things about white people.
*  And he gave this like super eloquent but yet compassionate speech about this where he's very charitable about her position of being a young person and not having the best perspective on things.
*  It was fucking brilliant.
*  Yeah it was brilliant.
*  That's the guy.
*  Like that's a president.
*  Now by modern standards of course he was a fascist.
*  Yeah. Well that's the weird thing about fascism right.
*  Because fascism by definition is almost always applied to right wing totalitarian governments but it's really kind of just adherence to the state and enforcing a doctrine and enforcing people to think and behave a very which is what the left wing does.
*  And then you talk about like being pro war.
*  Well who's more pro war right now.
*  Trump or the Biden administration.
*  Clearly Trump is less pro war.
*  Clearly Trump wants to end the wars.
*  Clearly Biden just allowed Ukraine to use long range missiles into Russia like this is.
*  I don't know what's going on in terms of negotiations.
*  I hear all kinds of different things.
*  But if you looked at one side that is pushing for these wars and seems to be all in on it and the other side that's not like with the fucking polar shift is so dramatic.
*  It's really weird the free speech thing which was always a tenant of the left wing party.
*  It was like you know I mean it was doctrine like free speech is necessary.
*  It's it's it's the foundation of our ability to discuss and find out what's right what's wrong.
*  You have to be.
*  I mean it's the ADL used to let fucking Nazis speak.
*  They still let them march.
*  They would defend their right to do it.
*  Right. Right.
*  Yeah. Because you needed to air out the idea to be able to show why it was wrong.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah. So look it was not that long ago when you had Democrats that were very much in favor of many of these extremely sensible positions.
*  Super recent.
*  It was pretty recent.
*  And so I.
*  But again reason for after.
*  I don't know if they're going to I don't know if they're going to pull it off.
*  They might just get they might go crazy or like they might just go right off the cliff like it's certainly possible.
*  But like it is also possible that they'll drag it back and it might happen quite quickly.
*  And I'm hopeful.
*  I am as well.
*  I think the temperature of society like the mindset of society is so clearly moving away from that madness that they're going to have to course correct which is just logical.
*  There's there's no way they're going to keep doing it the same way or double down.
*  It's just not going to.
*  It's like they're going to go the way that MSNBC they're going to become ridiculous.
*  Yeah that's right.
*  So they have to which is good for everyone for everyone.
*  So one of my theories is you can separate the concepts of the United States and America and you can be very optimistic about America and have all kinds of issues with the United States but still be positive about America.
*  And the difference is the United States is the formal system of the government and the politics and all the stuff we get mad about.
*  And America is the people.
*  Right.
*  Right. And so you can be as I am incredibly bullish about the people.
*  And then it's just a question of whether the America part.
*  And it's just a question of whether you can get the United States part kind of lined up to at least not prevent good things from happening and ideally help good things.
*  Well what are the things that you think about this administration at least what they're proposing that would move us in that direction as opposed to the way things were going.
*  There's a lot of things I mean I think you got to start with the Doge the Department of Government Efficiency.
*  Yeah.
*  That you know Ilan.
*  It's hilarious that it just winds up being Doge.
*  D-O-G-E. He's been pushing Dogecoin forever.
*  The universe speaks.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just so so many things are just so on the nose.
*  You're like it's a simulation real.
*  Yes.
*  I mean it has to be real.
*  Yes exactly exactly.
*  And Ilan is programming in the back room late at night in between playing.
*  We certainly got a good position in the game.
*  And tweeting exactly.
*  He's the number one Diablo player in the world right now.
*  Exactly.
*  He just got number one.
*  Which means fucking bananas.
*  How does he have the time to do that.
*  Which means he could be the guy steering the simulation.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah so look this goes back to what we were talking about before like it just it is time to carve this government back in size and scope.
*  It's time to take the overall.
*  You know you could talk about distribution of taxes but it's time to take the overall tax load down.
*  It's time to take the spending down.
*  It's time to get the government out of the position of deciding who gets money.
*  It's time to unleash economic growth.
*  Ilan explained that there's more agencies than there have been years of the United States.
*  Correct.
*  Yeah 450 federal agencies and two new ones a year.
*  And then my favorite twist is we have this thing called independent federal agencies.
*  So for example this thing called the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau CFPB which was the sort of Elizabeth Warren's personal agency that she gets to control.
*  And it's an independent agency that just gets to run and do whatever it wants.
*  Right.
*  And if you read the Constitution like there is no such thing as an independent agency and yet there it is.
*  What does her agency do.
*  Whatever she wants.
*  What does it do though.
*  Basically terrorize terrorize financial institutions prevent fintech prevent new competition new startups that want to compete with the big banks.
*  Oh yeah.
*  How so.
*  Just terrorizing anybody who tries to do anything new in financial services.
*  Can you give me an example.
*  I guess you know debanking.
*  This is where a lot of the debanking comes from is these agencies.
*  So debanking is when you're you as either a person or your company are literally kicked out of the banking system.
*  Like they did to Kanye.
*  Exactly like they did to Kanye.
*  My partner Ben's father has been debanked.
*  Really.
*  We had an employee.
*  For what.
*  For having the wrong politics.
*  For saying unacceptable things.
*  Under current banking regulations under.
*  OK here's a great here's a great thing under current banking regulations after all the reforms the last 20 years there's now a category called a politically exposed person.
*  PEP.
*  And if you were a PEP you are required by financial regulators to kick them off of your to kick them out of your bank.
*  You're not allowed to have your politically on the left.
*  That's fine.
*  No because they're because they're not politically exposed.
*  So no one on the left gets debanked.
*  I have not heard of a single instance of anyone in the left getting.
*  Can you tell me what the person that you know did what they said that got them.
*  Debanked.
*  Oh well I mean David Horowitz is a right wing you know he's pro Trump.
*  I mean he's said all kinds of things you know he's been very anti Islamic terrorism he's been very worried about immigration all these things.
*  And they debanked him for that.
*  They did bank.
*  So you get kicked out you get kicked out of your bank account you get you get kicked out of the you can't do credit card transactions.
*  By the way you can't run.
*  Is that legal.
*  Well exactly.
*  So this is the thing.
*  And so and then you go on this thing of like well there's no.
*  This is where the government and the companies get intertwined back to your fascism point which is there's no there's a constitutional amendment that says the government can't restrict your speech but there's no constitutional amendment that says the government can't debank you.
*  Right.
*  So they can't do the one thing that they do the other thing and then they don't have to debank you they just have to put pressure on the private company banks to do it.
*  And then the private company banks do it because they're expected to.
*  But the government gets to say we didn't do it.
*  It was the private company that did it.
*  And of course JP Morgan can decide who they want to have as customers.
*  Of course.
*  Right.
*  Is there a private company.
*  And so it's this is this sleight of hand that happens.
*  So it's basically it's a privatized sanctions regime that lets bureaucrats do to American citizens the same thing that we do to Iran.
*  Well kick you out of the financial system.
*  And so this has been happening to all the crypto entrepreneurs in the last four years.
*  This has been happening a lot of the fintech entrepreneurs anybody trying to start any kind of new banking service because they're trying to protect the big banks.
*  And then this has been happening by the way also in legal fields of economic activity that they don't like.
*  And so a lot of this started about 15 years ago with this thing called Operation Truckpoint where they decided to as marijuana started to become legal as prostitution started become legal and then guns which there's always a fight about.
*  Under the Obama administration they started to debank legal marijuana businesses escort businesses and then and then and then gun shops just like your gun manufacturers and just like you're done you're out of the banking system.
*  And so if you're running a medical marijuana dispensary in 2012 like you guess what you're doing your business all in cash because you literally can't get a bank account you can't get a visa terminal you can't process transactions.
*  You can't do payroll you can't do direct deposit you can't get insurance like none of that stuff is you've been sanctioned.
*  None of that stuff is available and then this administration extended that concept to apply it to tech founders crypto founders and then just generally political opponents.
*  Yeah so that's that's been like super pernicious.
*  I wasn't aware of that.
*  Oh 100 percent.
*  And it's called so it's Operation Truckpoint 1.0 was 15 years ago against the pot and the guns.
*  Truckpoint 2.0 is primarily against their political enemies and then to their disfavored tech startups.
*  And it's hit the tech world like we've had like 30 founders debanked in the last four years.
*  Real.
*  Yeah yeah yeah yeah it's been it's been a big recurring pattern.
*  This is one of the reasons why we ended up supporting Trump.
*  We just can't we can't live in this world we can't live in a world where somebody starts a company that's a completely legal thing and then they literally get sanctioned.
*  Right and embargoed by the United States government through a completely unaccountable note by the way no due process.
*  None of this is written down.
*  There's no rules.
*  There's no court.
*  There is no decision process.
*  There is no appeal.
*  Who do you appeal to.
*  Right.
*  Who do you go to to get your bank account back.
*  Right.
*  You know and then you know and then there's this and then there's also the civil asset forfeiture side of it which is right the other side and that doesn't happen to us but that happens to people in a lot of places now who get arrested and all of a sudden you know the state takes their money.
*  Yes.
*  That happens to people if they get pulled over and they have a large amount of cash.
*  Some states.
*  Right.
*  Or you know there'll be there been you know well publicized examples of like you know there was like you know there'll be some investigation into like you know safe deposit boxes and the next thing you know the.
*  The feds have seized all the all the contents of the state deposit right.
*  Safe deposit boxes and that stuff never gets returned.
*  And so it's this and this is when you know this is when Trump says the deep state you know like the way we would describe it is it's it's administrative power.
*  It's it's political power being administered not through legislation.
*  Right.
*  So there's no defined law that covers this.
*  It's not through regulation.
*  Right.
*  There's nothing you can you can't go sue a regulator to fix this.
*  It's not through any kind of court judgment.
*  It's just raw power.
*  It's just raw administrative power.
*  It's the government or politicians just deciding that things are going to be a certain way and then they just apply pressure until they get it.
*  So what happens to those 30 tech people that you know.
*  Start to go into a different field like try to do something different and try to try to try to get you know complete upending of your life complete upending of your life and try to try to try to change your try to get out of try to get away from the eye of soren.
*  Try to get out of whatever zone got you into this and keep applying for new bank accounts at different banks and hope that at some point a bank will say you know OK you know it's OK we've checked in it's now all right.
*  Whoa.
*  But there's no.
*  So what do they do with their money like what happens.
*  You I mean you go to cash.
*  I mean you go to cash.
*  You can't have a.
*  Yeah.
*  So where do you put it.
*  Under your mat under your mattress.
*  Yes exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  That is so insane.
*  Yeah someone has 30 million dollars in the bank and they get D banked.
*  Diamonds art you know do you.
*  I don't know go overseas somewhere.
*  Holy shit.
*  Yeah yeah yeah.
*  And just like it just it just happens.
*  And again it's really important.
*  There's no fingerprints like there's no.
*  Right.
*  There's no person who.
*  There's no stick above the strings.
*  Yeah exactly.
*  It just happened.
*  And we can trace it back because we understand exactly you know we know we know that we know the politicians involved and we know how the agencies work and we know how the pressures.
*  Applied and we know that the banks get phone calls and so forth and so we can loosely like we understand the flow of power as it happens.
*  But when you're on the receiving end of this your specific instance of it like you can't trace it back.
*  So these what are the instances like what is the company what are they trying to do and how do they run a foul.
*  Well all the crypto startups in the last basically four years.
*  So remember the crypto crypto thing got like really you know sort of everybody got excited and like entities and like all that stuff and just like stopped.
*  Yeah.
*  And the reason it stopped is because basically every crypto founder every crypto startup they either got debanked personally and forced out of the industry or their company got debanked and so it couldn't keep operating or they got prosecuted charged or they got threatened with being charged.
*  This is a fun this is a fun twist.
*  It was a fun little twist.
*  The SEC.
*  So the SEC sort of has been trying to kill the crypto industry under under Biden.
*  And this has been a big issue issue for us because we're the biggest crypto crypto startup investor.
*  The SEC can they can investigate you they can subpoena you they can prosecute you they can do all these things but they don't have to do any of those things to really damage you all they have to do is they issue what's called a Wells notice and the Wells notice is a notification that you may be charged at some point in the future.
*  You're like on notice that you might be doing something wrong and they might be coming after you at some point in the future.
*  Oh my God.
*  OK.
*  Terrifying.
*  Yes.
*  The eye of Sauron is on you.
*  Now trying to be a company with a Wells notice doing business with anybody else.
*  Oh my God.
*  Right. Try to try to work with a big company try to get access to a bank try to do.
*  So that's when they support D.E.I. initiatives and they.
*  Well then the SEC the SEC under Biden became the SEC under Biden became a direct application of exactly.
*  So D.E.I. they started they did a lot with that and then yes all the ESG stuff and ESG is a very malleable concept and they piled all kinds of new requirements into that.
*  So through that through this process the SEC could basically just simply dictate what companies do with no accountability at all.
*  Like there's no you know there's no there's no over there are hearings where they get yelled at but like nothing changed nothing ever happened in a hearing that ever changed anything.
*  Just the raw application of power.
*  Right.
*  And so this is your friends.
*  This is happened to.
*  Oh yeah for sure. Yeah.
*  We had like I said we had an employee who got the bank because he had crypto in his job title.
*  He was doing crypto policy for us and his bank booted him because he.
*  That's it.
*  Because they did it they did it they did a screen across.
*  It's what they told us is they did a screen across their their customer base.
*  Anyone with crypto.
*  Because because anybody with crypto became a politically exposed person.
*  Because wow this crypto was was politically controversial right.
*  That's so you hear that sometimes it's like completely these terms compliance reputation management.
*  Yeah.
*  Tone at the top.
*  They have these lovely sounding terms that make it sound like everybody's going to be an upstanding citizen.
*  But what they're all they're all code for is destroy the enemy like bring the hammer of God and the bank and the government or whoever or the.
*  Social media bring it down and just like crush the individual.
*  Wow.
*  With no due process.
*  Look there's an argument in the long run that this is all unconstitutional because the Constitution gives us all the right to do process and this is government pressure and there's.
*  Right.
*  So like there's probably a Supreme Court case in five years that's going to find retroactively that this was all illegal.
*  But in the moment when you're the guy who's been debanked I mean.
*  Right.
*  And then also the potential that if you do challenge them in court and lose the repercussions to be even heavier.
*  Exactly.
*  Yeah.
*  100 percent.
*  Why is it really worth your effort.
*  Is it worth the risk.
*  That's right.
*  Especially if you've already had your life upended you ready to do it again.
*  Yeah that's right.
*  When you barely built yourself back up.
*  Yeah.
*  So this is and I think this is important context or like when Elon and the VAC talk about like reducing regulation you know there's two ways of thinking about reducing regulation it's like oh my God the water in the air are going to get dirty and the food's going to get poisoned.
*  Right.
*  Now some of those regulations I think are very important.
*  But the other way to think about it is examples like this which is just raw government power being applied to ordinary people who are just trying to live their lives are just trying to do something legitimate and they're just on the wrong side of something.
*  That's right.
*  When power have decided.
*  Well there's something that isn't illegal but they don't want to be done.
*  Like crypto.
*  Crypto or having the wrong political points of view.
*  Well the trucker you know the other great example is the trucker strike up in Canada.
*  Yeah.
*  Even more direct version of this because here you had truckers physically showing up and it was something like step one was they take away your driver's license which by the way right.
*  It's just somebody pressing a button on the keyboard.
*  No more driver's license.
*  Step two is to take away your insurance.
*  And step three is to take away your kids.
*  Right.
*  And so like that was their version of this and that was a very specific take away your kids.
*  That was the threat at the end to the truckers and the Canada trucker strike because the truck because the trucker strike in Canada right was going to jam up these cities because it was the farmers were the truckers were very serious.
*  They wanted to they were doing a nonviolent protest but they wanted to stall the cities to be able to exert political pressure back back on the government.
*  Right.
*  And the government is like we'll tolerate it for a little while then we'll take your trucker license then we'll take your insurance and we'll take your kids.
*  And how do they say they would take their kids.
*  Because it's administrative it's administrative power like you can't you can't write the theory of it you can't let these aren't good parents if they're sitting in a truck in the middle of Calgary preventing goods and services from reaching people right putting people's lives at risk.
*  Wow.
*  You know child child seizure.
*  Now I don't know if they actually see any kids but it's just an example of there is an agency in the Canadian government just like in the US government that if they want to they can take your kids.
*  Well they were doing de-banking there with people who donated to the trucker convoy.
*  That's right.
*  Which is even crazier.
*  That's right.
*  Not even people who were there.
*  People were opposed to the mandates that Trudeau's administration was imposing on people.
*  And so they donated to these truckers and then they got their bank accounts taken away.
*  Which is really crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  And so and I and I think exactly and I think that I think that right way to think about this is when we think about totalitarianism we think about literally World War 2 you know we think about Nazis and Jack Boots with like tanks and guns and you know beating people up and killing people like that.
*  That's our mental and that that's you might call that hard totalitarianism right.
*  That's like very clearly like violent totalitarianism.
*  But there's this other version you might call soft totalitarianism which is just rules and power exercised arbitrarily that just simply suppresses everything.
*  Right.
*  And this is speech control and de-banking and all these other things that we've been talking about.
*  And that is that you know the good news is they're not coming up and like beating you up in the middle of the night.
*  The bad news is like you are under their complete control and they can do whatever they want to you that doesn't involve physical violence which basically includes the entire aspect of you know every aspect of how you actually conduct your life and support your family.
*  And get an income and everything else.
*  And most people aren't even aware of it.
*  Yeah that's right. And then you know like these are these are individual one off things most people don't have a voice.
*  It's very hard to organize you know organize around these.
*  And then by the way if there's an organization that organizes to try to get these stories out it then itself can get it suppressed and de-banked.
*  Well it happened during the COVID lockdowns right.
*  So so the lockdown protests all got suppressed.
*  Right. So you went you know so it's like so the lockdown went from two weeks to crush the curve to two months to two years.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  Which is like OK what the hell.
*  Right.
*  And then there were these protests that were there were these protests that were forming out nonviolent protests that were forming out to protest lockdowns.
*  And you know you could argue the issue different ways but people have a legitimate right to protest for that just like they do for anything else.
*  And the next thing you know is all the lockdown protests got censored like just like boop gone.
*  Right. And so at that point like the normal process of being able to read to try to get redress from your government right for you know for to force your rights to literally for example see your family all of a sudden like you can't even organize a protest.
*  Do you how much are you aware of what happened with the FTX crisis because one of the things that happened with the FTX thing was it was revealed that they were I think they were the number two donor to the Democratic Party.
*  Do you think that that is sort of a preemptive measure to avoid any of this de-banking and you know be financially invested in these people so they're not going to come after you.
*  That was his it was explicitly his strategy.
*  That was Sam's yeah Sam's approach Sam's approach is just pay everybody.
*  So Sam's approach was just I have eight billion dollars of customer funds that I can use for whatever I want.
*  Right. Which is the crime.
*  Right. And then a big part of what he used some of it he used to like hang out with celebrities and get Tom and Giselle to endorse FTX and the Larry David commercial and all this stuff.
*  Right.
*  But a lot of that money something like one hundred fifty million dollars of that money went to basically just pay politicians.
*  And a lot of that money was paid to politicians with no compliance at all with all the campaign finance regulations that the rest of us all have to comply with.
*  And so the money was just shotgun out the door.
*  How come they don't have to comply.
*  Well it was illegal. I mean it was illegal because he was breaking the law.
*  I mean it was to be clear he was he was illegal.
*  Now a very funny thing happened which is when he was indicted by the U.S.
*  government they didn't they ended up not charging him on campaign finance fraud.
*  And because they'd have to give all the money back.
*  Well so there's two theories on it.
*  The thing that they said was their extradition agreement with Bermuda Bermuda threatened to not extradite him if they charged him on that charge which is like super weird because you're the United.
*  Number one you're the United States of America you can probably get the guy.
*  Number two did he really want to stay in a prison in Bermuda.
*  Right. And so that was all weird.
*  And then and then look the other there's no evidence for this but the other theory is yeah the whoever are the powers that be that decide these things in D.C. decided to not open it.
*  It's it's like the Epstein client list like there are certain boxes.
*  Yeah.
*  That are better not to open.
*  Well the campaign finance thing wouldn't they have to pay it back.
*  So then there's this like panic.
*  The minute one of these scandals breaks like that there's this panic rush and all of a sudden politicians discover philanthropic causes they can donate the money to.
*  Right.
*  And then yeah in the fullness of time the trustees might come claw the money back.
*  So yeah there's you know it'll it'll play out however it does but it is it is interesting it is a great example of.
*  It was the shotgun money into the system under like basically just like nakedly breaking the law and then it now look he's in the other argument is he's in prison he's in prison already like whatever it just would have been.
*  You know another sentence but like he did break the law and he was not actually charged on that and that prosecution has not happened and probably sitting here today never will.
*  What's really fascinating about him is that he was right.
*  And if they didn't come after him he would have gotten all that money to those people.
*  He would it seems like it kind of turned around right.
*  It didn't get him off the hook though.
*  It didn't know what he did something he still did something illegal.
*  He did.
*  Yeah.
*  Did he know it was illegal.
*  He is in prison.
*  I think it's really hard to get inside that guy's head.
*  Yeah I don't know that I can represent his mental state.
*  He'd be a fascinating podcast guest if he was out.
*  He flopped very hardly very hard at trial.
*  Yeah.
*  So he he had an explanation but that's just the jury didn't buy it.
*  What was his explanation that you know he was you know that it was all the money was all being invested and he was going to give it all back and it was all this and that you know all these complicated theories around all this effective altruism and this and that the other thing and the prosecution is just like it was the customer's money.
*  It wasn't your money.
*  Right.
*  Clearly.
*  Yeah.
*  And so I like I don't know like yeah.
*  Well there's also amphetamines involved which definitely tend to skew your judgment.
*  I mean him and that lady were like sort of proponents of amphetamine use.
*  And they were taking there was some anti Parkinson's drug they were taking.
*  That has a side effect of reducing your risk.
*  Oh don't be an agonist.
*  Yeah one of those.
*  Yeah like re equip.
*  Yeah something like that.
*  Never he had these patches.
*  He was taking these patches.
*  That makes you do wild shit.
*  That also makes people gamble.
*  Yeah exactly.
*  Well yeah.
*  Yeah there was a guy who won a lawsuit from Glaxo Smith Klein because he took re equip and became a gay sex and gambling addict.
*  Yeah I think they paid him the equivalent of like five hundred plus thousand American dollars.
*  I believe it was in Ireland.
*  Yeah.
*  Dopamine agonists are weird.
*  They they do strange things to people.
*  If that happened to me I would definitely sue.
*  That's crazy that those guys were taking those things.
*  At least Sam Sam was.
*  Oh boy what a wild fella.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm Sam.
*  Confirmed he wears an M.
*  Sam patch.
*  What's an M.
*  Sam patch.
*  He's supposed to use the depression medication.
*  Oh his supposed use of the depression medication had kicked up some rumors.
*  So what is that's the stuff.
*  That's the Parkinson's.
*  I think that was.
*  Is that a dopamine agonist.
*  Does it say.
*  I'm not sure.
*  Yeah.
*  See put dopamine agonist.
*  Yeah Parkinson's.
*  There we go.
*  Yeah.
*  Interesting.
*  It's like related.
*  If it's not that it's like a related.
*  Interesting.
*  How does it work.
*  Does it say how it works.
*  Commonly used to depression.
*  How does it work though.
*  Oh.
*  OK.
*  It's an M.A.O.
*  Inhibitor.
*  Interesting.
*  Used to treat mental depression in adults.
*  This medicine is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor.
*  Different one that says it's sludge.
*  Oh that's sludge.
*  Oh OK.
*  Yeah that's sludge.
*  Sledge is also people take that as well as a new tropic I've heard.
*  Yeah that's what it is.
*  So it isn't a sludge.
*  A sedule.
*  So cell gene.
*  Cell gene.
*  So ledger lean.
*  I think it's allegedly.
*  I knew a doctor who is taking that.
*  He was taking it as a but not in a patch.
*  He was taking a pill form and he said it was a new tropic.
*  So monoamine oxidase inhibitor.
*  So that's the stuff that's the active and that's what makes Iowaska orally active.
*  Same thing.
*  Monoamine oxidase inhibitor along with the plant that contains dimethyltryptamine which
*  is not normally orally active.
*  So this guy if he was doing drugs and taking MAO inhibitors he was out of his fucking
*  mind guaranteed because I know people who have taken like prescription grade MAO
*  inhibitors and then taken mushrooms and literally almost never came back.
*  Like got to the point where for weeks they were fucked up and then when they did come
*  back they were like I almost lost it.
*  Like I was almost gone gone.
*  Like you know like the dude from Pink Floyd like never coming back.
*  Shine on you crazy diamond.
*  You're gone.
*  And that happens to people.
*  So this fucking kid with billions of dollars people's money is taking those kinds of
*  medications and amphetamines and who knows what.
*  Yeah.
*  You know he had an on staff psychiatrist who was prescribing all this stuff.
*  Wonderful like Hitler.
*  Once again.
*  That's so crazy.
*  What a wild boy.
*  Are you following the cycle of the theories that now emerging around ismic and psychological
*  changes that is because this.
*  No but I did read that it makes your heart shrink.
*  Well there's some theory to that which is very concerning but there is.
*  Yeah it is.
*  There's a fair amount of evidence that it resolves alcohol addiction certain forms of
*  drug addiction and gambling addictions.
*  And the current theory is that what it does is it basically essentially increases your
*  self control your self discipline and it reduces cravings.
*  And there is a theory that this is very positive.
*  Let's say this is true which is what they think right now.
*  We'll see. But that's what they think.
*  So the theory that it's positive is the theory that you know if we were all like more
*  responsible in our lives we'd all be more successful and society would go better.
*  Yeah.
*  Counter argument would be like responsible is only part of living and it's only part of
*  what makes a society work.
*  And we also need risk taking and we need creativity.
*  Yes.
*  We need impulsiveness.
*  Yes.
*  Right. And we need variety.
*  Yes.
*  And maybe we're all going to get into a channel.
*  Right.
*  Right. And maybe we're not going to like where that where that that just by itself ends
*  up.
*  Yeah you can't have everybody discipline.
*  You have to have wild fuckers out there.
*  You have to have your jelly rolls of the world.
*  Crazy people. They're fun.
*  They make things more interesting.
*  That's right.
*  So it's essentially discipline in a pill form or an injectable form.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's very helpful.
*  I prescribe increasingly starting to prescribe it to alcoholics and apparently it's
*  working quite well.
*  That's crazy.
*  Well that's that brings me to Ibogaine which is the one thing that has like the most
*  success for people with addictions and it's illegal in this country.
*  People go down to Mexico and go to these Ibogaine retreats.
*  It's apparently I haven't done it but it's apparently this insane introspective
*  journey that's very uncomfortable and it lasts about 24 hours.
*  It's not something that's addictive in any way shape or form.
*  Almost everyone says it's a very uncomfortable experience but you gain unbelievable
*  insight into what is wrong with you that makes you want to pick up heroin.
*  Like what what's going on in there that you're trying to escape.
*  Like what is this.
*  And it recognizes that pathway and puts a chemical stop there.
*  It actually like stops people from having addictive cravings and it rewires the way
*  they think about things particularly beneficial to veterans.
*  A lot of veterans who have just seen way too much and come over and they're all
*  fucked up and they don't have any way to straighten their brain out and they've
*  had tremendous benefits using that.
*  You know I wonder with particularly with these these ozempics and wake of E and
*  all these different types of weight loss diabetic drugs.
*  I wonder if there's a way to mitigate these side effects because you know when
*  I've talked to people that think that like my friend Brigham Brigham Bueller who
*  runs Waste Well he's concerned about side effects of it but he's also he looks at
*  people that are just morbidly obese and he's like these people they need some
*  fucking help.
*  They've gone down this terrible road.
*  Yes they shouldn't have done it.
*  Yes.
*  OK we all agree to that.
*  No don't eat pie all day.
*  But if you've gotten to 500 pounds you're probably you're in a bad state and you
*  could probably use some help and maybe that could get them back on track.
*  Maybe there's a way with maybe strength training because one of the things is
*  they lose a large percentage of muscle mass and bone density.
*  Maybe that can be mitigated with strength training.
*  Maybe it's one of those things that if you're going to get on an ozempic you must
*  lift weights three times a week.
*  Which is that might be it.
*  I mean if it's just losing tissue there's certainly that's that's relatively easy to
*  fix.
*  That's right.
*  And there's by the way there's a ton of R&D going into these drugs right now so
*  there's a lot more versions of these things.
*  I'm hopeful that we could develop something where no one can ever be obese
*  again.
*  That would be really interesting.
*  I mean maybe this is just the first steps of this right.
*  And then like these are crude versions of what will ultimately be a very
*  comprehensive way of addressing an issue like that.
*  So the other thing I'd say so I've been down in Florida the last couple of weeks
*  working on some of the stuff happening down there and one of the things I learned
*  is that the RFK the RFK is really in charge of health for the country from here
*  you know for like he's really in charge.
*  Working with the president and he you know for all the controversy around some of
*  his positions like he's you know this whole like he's very serious about this
*  and a lot of people including a lot of the most qualified people I know in the
*  field are like yes it is long overdue that we look at the food system.
*  Yes.
*  And we look at all these all just whatever to your point the horrible track that
*  we've been on for 40 years.
*  Yeah.
*  Just a complete catastrophe.
*  And I think it's a there's this concept of psychology called common knowledge
*  which is it's like it's something that everybody knows but yet nobody states
*  out loud.
*  And so it like it's like known but then all of a sudden there's a tipping point
*  and all of a sudden it's not only known but it's like obvious all of a sudden
*  everybody agrees on it.
*  Yes.
*  And this feels like one of those moments where it's like nutrition behavioral you
*  know exercise like the path that people are on to become obese like no like this
*  actually needs to be addressed.
*  Yes.
*  This is actually a profound issue and it's yes it's we're on the road to hell
*  and like it has to get fixed and maybe it gets it gets fixed chemically and maybe
*  it gets fixed behaviorally or other things.
*  Maybe the culture has to change but like it has to get fixed.
*  And I'm actually I've been very encouraged that that I think this is now going to be
*  a very big focus here and not just by the government but I think also in the
*  culture.
*  I agree.
*  And I'm very encouraged as well and I think as we were talking before about a sort
*  of a shift in perspective of the country I think a shift in perspective of the
*  country towards that being something that you should strive towards.
*  I think that's coming too.
*  I think that's happening right now.
*  One of the happiest moments for me is when I run into someone and they said they
*  were inspired to get fit and healthy from listening to me talking about the
*  benefits of it.
*  I've talked to so many people that lost 100 pounds 150 pounds.
*  They're exercising regularly.
*  They eat healthy.
*  It's fantastic.
*  It's one of my favorite things when I run into people that are fans of the
*  podcast.
*  So one of my theories on this is that this is part of this what happened is
*  something very specific happened during Covid which is the public health people
*  by and large looked very unhealthy.
*  Yes.
*  They did right.
*  They didn't look good.
*  Right.
*  And so you've got these people standing up there telling everybody how they've
*  got to do all the lockdowns and the masks and like all that stuff.
*  Yeah.
*  Bill Gates should get jacked.
*  That would be very helpful.
*  He's got a lot of money.
*  It would be extremely helpful.
*  Get a trainer.
*  When he writes the book and goes on the press tour to talk about public health
*  for how the rest of us should live.
*  That would be great.
*  Yeah.
*  By the way be great for him and his family and society.
*  It would be very reassuring.
*  Bill Gates had a six pack.
*  I'd listen to him more.
*  That I think would be absolutely fantastic.
*  And so like it's just this thing it's just like well of course like yes the people
*  who are telling us all how to live and eat ought to be healthy.
*  Right.
*  And if they're not like clearly that's where our FK comes in play 100 percent.
*  He looks fantastic.
*  He looks great.
*  He looks great.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Super.
*  Like yeah it's just like wow.
*  Yeah we're taking a picture.
*  I'm like dude you're jacked.
*  I'm going to put my arm on him like you're fucking jack dude.
*  Yeah.
*  Works out all the time at Gold's gym in Venice.
*  There we go.
*  Jeans on.
*  Awesome.
*  Works out with jeans on.
*  That's old school.
*  I don't get that.
*  That's amazing.
*  That seems weird.
*  It seems like it gets in the way your squats unless you wear like like origin jeans.
*  It's got a lot of stretchy fabric to it.
*  Yeah.
*  You have to give stretchy jeans.
*  But even then like put some shorts on.
*  Fuck a weirdo.
*  What are you doing man.
*  It's like it's like it's like it's like prison yard credibility.
*  It's fantastic.
*  It is a little it is a little street.
*  Ready old school.
*  You know we're in Timbaland's yes Timbaland's and a pair of jeans and doing your squats.
*  It's kind of crazy.
*  But the promotion of health is like I don't know how anybody could be against that.
*  Do you want more energy.
*  Do you want more vitality in your life.
*  We should be healthier.
*  It's like you're you know your body's race car and you could choose if you work hard
*  enough to jack up the horsepower.
*  You can make better brakes.
*  You can have a better fuel injection system like the whole thing could work way better.
*  I have to do is work at it.
*  And that is your vehicle for propelling you through this life.
*  It'll give you more energy for creativity more energy for your family more energy for
*  your hobbies your recreations time with your friends.
*  You literally have more energy as a human which is what we all like.
*  Nobody likes waking up and feeling like shit.
*  I mean everybody's been hung over who's had a few drinks and you wake up in the morning
*  like what am I doing.
*  I don't ever want to do this again.
*  Why did I do this to myself.
*  And then you can't wait for the day we feel better like you drink your electrolytes you
*  get your sleep you do whatever the fuck you can.
*  And you're like I'll be over this soon.
*  Go your head.
*  And you know everybody likes having more energy.
*  It's better for you.
*  And we could promote that as a society.
*  And this R.F.K.
*  Junior appointment is a really big step in that direction that we've really never had
*  before.
*  That's right.
*  You have to go back to like literally his uncle Jeff K.
*  had a program like this in like 1962.
*  Yeah.
*  In a long time.
*  Well Michelle Obama did for a bit right a little bit although that was like vegetarian
*  you know you're getting into like vegetarian school.
*  Oh was she saying vegetarian.
*  I know she was vegetarian but label Eric Adams you know the governor mayor of New York
*  he's trying to push vegetarian school lunches.
*  It's like no.
*  That's not right.
*  No that's not right.
*  It's so dumb I can't wait until they can figure out the plants really can think and
*  feel because they're real close.
*  They're real close to proving that they've demonstrated intelligence and allocation of
*  resources through mycelium.
*  There's a lot of stuff that we know now about plants that we didn't know then.
*  I think they're all conscious.
*  I think everything's conscious.
*  Yeah I think we need we need audio recordings of the screams.
*  Yeah.
*  When you mow the lawn it's just like Armageddon.
*  You know the thing to play audio recordings of caterpillars eating leaves and it changes
*  the flavor profile of all the plants around it.
*  Awesome.
*  Yeah.
*  They've done this because there's a phenomenon when giraffes if giraffes are eating if
*  they are upwind and they're eating leaves as the wind comes down it gets to the other
*  acacia trees the acacia trees will they'll come up with this phytochemical they produce
*  a phytochemical that's disgusting to the giraffes and the giraffes literally starve
*  because they won't eat those trees.
*  And they do this somehow or another through communication.
*  It's like they're preventing war.
*  They're being attacked by mammals and they're like we have to stop the attack and nature
*  has provided them with this mechanism to do that which is really crazy.
*  It's amazing.
*  So back back to the back to the dose for a moment.
*  So the one of the reasons why everybody became unhealthy is because the government
*  directly exerted put itself into the food system and specifically high fructose corn
*  syrup right high fructose corn syrup was an artifact of government agriculture subsidies.
*  Right.
*  The country was which was good during World War 2 because we needed food at one time.
*  Yeah right.
*  But like by the 1970s we were massively overproducing specifically we're massively
*  overproducing corn and the corn the corn lobby the sort of agriculture lobby became
*  very powerful.
*  And we have this government agency one of the 450 government agencies is the USDA and
*  the USDA has a dual mandate.
*  It's to promote U.S.
*  agriculture specifically things like corn and it's also to advise us on what we should
*  eat.
*  And they also do the food pyramid.
*  And that's why the food pyramid is upside down right for all those decades.
*  Where we're supposed to eat carbs and not protein and fat was because literally this
*  the agency that's responsible for promoting agriculture and then that agency gets
*  inserted itself through laws regulations and this kind of administrative pressure.
*  And basically he said thou shalt use high fructose corn syrup because it is a by
*  product of corn as opposed to sugar.
*  Right.
*  And as we now know that was absolutely poisonous decision like that was like literal
*  literal poison absolutely ruinous decision just an absolute terrible idea.
*  Well Casey Means was on here and she was explaining the very mechanism by which high
*  fructose corn syrup encourages over consumption.
*  Right.
*  And then it's essentially like it's an evolutionary thing that like where bears would
*  eat like a bunch of berries to get fat for the winter.
*  It's like these high fructose corn syrup encourages you to over consume.
*  Yeah we were not supposed to be eating this.
*  This was not supposed to happen.
*  It would not have been drinking it 100 percent like yeah 100 percent.
*  And so but this would not have happened have the government not made it happen.
*  And so it traces directly back to a government decision to do that.
*  Now they didn't of course they didn't understand the consequences but that's kind of
*  the point which is they interfere without understanding the consequences.
*  And so that's the kind of thing where you look at it and you're just like all right.
*  And then you're 40 years later and you're still doing it.
*  And then at that and then at some point you know what the consequences are and then at
*  some point there's a question of whether they're being covered up.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  And it's just like OK at some point this has to stop.
*  Right.
*  And literally they just need to stop like they just need to stop subsidizing corn.
*  They need to stop forcing the food companies to do this.
*  They just need to stop.
*  And so this goes back to like the regulatory reform thing which is like there's just
*  like tremendous amount of this that may have been good intentioned at one point.
*  But sitting here today we're living with these horrible downstream consequences.
*  And unless somebody steps in with a hammer none of this is going to happen.
*  And they also have the insane amount of money that's involved because R.J.
*  Reynolds these tobacco companies when they were getting sanctioned they were getting
*  in trouble they decided well let's buy all these food companies.
*  And so now these same companies that lied about whether or not cigarettes are addictive
*  and cause cancer now these same companies are pushing super unhealthy food on people
*  or at least selling super unhealthy food people which I think you should be allowed to
*  buy. I think you should be allowed to buy whatever the fuck you want.
*  I'm all for that.
*  But I do think we should be much more aware of what's actually going on like you're
*  saying and why this stuff is in there in the first place.
*  Well and then you get in these other you know more delicate questions but it's like OK
*  food assistance programs for like you know low income people and low income children.
*  It's like OK should they be.
*  Do we want little kids who have no control over this to end up on the receiving end of
*  this food production pipeline right.
*  For with government money and being 300 pounds by the time they're right and cheaper than
*  other cheaper than other foods because they're subsidized because they're subsidized.
*  And so and you just you have this very perverse outcome where you have these government
*  officials who have been standing up there for 40 years saying we're protecting you we're
*  protecting you and what's been happening as they've been poisoning us.
*  Yeah.
*  And so it's like stuff like it just needs to stop.
*  And that's that's where you need something like the doge.
*  So and somebody like President Trump.
*  What would they be able to do to mitigate a lot of these issues.
*  Like how would they if you want to would you make it illegal to put high fructose corn
*  syrup as an ingredient or would you simply stop subsidizing.
*  Like and what would be how would that work within the government.
*  Like how would you apply something like that.
*  Yeah I think there's three things you can do two of which involve direct action and
*  then the third is maybe even the most important.
*  So one is you can just stop doing things that are harmful.
*  You can stop doing things the government can stop subsidizing bad things.
*  That's an example.
*  Giving parallel parallel thing if you want to clean up the universities you need to stop
*  feeding them student loans.
*  Right.
*  So right.
*  The government should stop paying for things that are clearly harmful.
*  So that's one.
*  And then two is look there may be a role for additional protections or prohibitions.
*  And so for example maybe you let people freely buy all the Oreos they want but maybe you
*  can't get them with food assistance programs so that you know kids who have no control
*  over it are not are not being poisoned.
*  And so you know you maybe do that.
*  But but I always think that the third thing is culture culture.
*  Like there's always a temptation with these discussions because the government is so
*  powerful to talk about what the government does or doesn't do.
*  And I think so much of this has to do with the culture.
*  It's actually upstream or downstream from politics which is like like what is the
*  cultural tone of the country.
*  Right.
*  What's the value system.
*  Right.
*  What are the role models.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  What are people being inspired to do.
*  Also what form of shaming is in effect.
*  Like what are what are we not going to tolerate.
*  Take the perverse fat studies like right.
*  Are we going to glorify obesity.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  No no.
*  And that's not necessarily a legal judgment or a court case but it's a it's a cultural
*  statement.
*  And if the if and I and it's not that the government plays it should control the culture
*  but our leaders certainly play a big role in that.
*  Yeah.
*  And so it both in and outside of government.
*  So for our leaders to step up at a moment like this and basically say no this is not
*  the kind of culture we're going to have it's not the kind of society we're going to have
*  it's not what kids should be looking up to.
*  I think I think is just as powerful as the actual government actions.
*  It's interesting you saying the kind of shaming because I don't want to shame anybody
*  for being fat but boy does that work.
*  Maybe you should say that shaming works and maybe you should shame parents if their
*  kids are fat.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  Problem is and maybe there's so many people that are ignorant as to what exactly is
*  going on.
*  Of course.
*  And that's like absolutely required.
*  Like they're being fed bullshit 100 percent.
*  And yeah.
*  But again it's also cultural just like OK is the media thing like is the media educating
*  people on this.
*  And if the mainstream media is not doing it right are there should there be new media
*  sources that are who gets in which source and then therefore which sources the media
*  get respect.
*  So we have this giant collective culture question right that we get to we all get to
*  ask an answer and particularly those of us in a position to be able to send messages
*  that a lot of people hear.
*  So that will help.
*  That will help move the needle.
*  But what specifically can R.F.K.
*  Junior do once he actually gets in.
*  I mean there's.
*  Oh yes.
*  Tremendous.
*  He was the secretary of HHS.
*  He has very broad you know I would say a very broad ability to look at this holistically
*  inside the government.
*  What kind of pushback is there going to be against that.
*  Like that seems like a wild amount of money is going to be lost.
*  Yeah.
*  So there's there's there's there's there's the work that the cabinet secretary is like
*  he will be doing formally and then there's the work that the Doge and the president will
*  be doing kind of in parallel with that and you know there will be some convergence between
*  those and you know there's the we'll see there's a potential here for quite dramatic action
*  on a lot of these fronts.
*  Could you imagine if you're running an agency and you have to have a meeting with Vivek and
*  Elon.
*  Yes.
*  And you got to open your books.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  Like office space where they brought in the Bobs for console.
*  What do you do here.
*  Exactly.
*  That's exactly what it's like.
*  Is there a meme like that.
*  Is there a meme like that.
*  I think there's a meme where they take those guys and they put Elon and Vivek heads on
*  them.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  There was another key timeline split that happened in Silicon Valley about two years
*  ago actually two and a half years ago when Elon was actually right before he took over
*  Twitter where he got in an email fight with the CEO of Twitter at the time who's actually
*  a guy who's a friend of mine is a really good guy but had it literally this guy had just
*  been promoted from engineering to run the company and then like a month later he ends
*  up trying to deal with the situation so kind of got a little bit sandbagged on it.
*  But yes.
*  Of course he said Elon Musk says he rewatched office space to prepare for Doge.
*  Of course he did.
*  Of course he did.
*  Fucking psycho.
*  Exactly.
*  God we're so lucky that guy's around.
*  Exactly.
*  So there was this moment in the Twitter takeover where Elon sends his email and he says
*  and the line is what did you get done this week.
*  Whoa.
*  What did you get done this week.
*  And in the context of Silicon Valley companies that was a provocative statement because a
*  lot of Silicon Valley companies take months or years to do anything.
*  But imagine that statement being applied to the government.
*  Oh my God.
*  Right. Like the level of like accelerated like OK what are the problems.
*  How are we going to fix them and what have you gotten done this week.
*  Yeah. You think debanking upended some lives.
*  Yes exactly.
*  So yes what have you done this week.
*  And by the way when Elon Musk it's actually interesting a guy just tweeted a guy just
*  tweeted or posted or Zeded what it's like to work for Elon at his AI company XAI.
*  And he said Elon came in last week and he said Elon spent 18 hours at the office and
*  in five minute chunks and it was every five each person had a five minute speaking slot
*  to explain to Elon what they were doing.
*  Wow.
*  And he did that for you know five times whatever.
*  Right.
*  18 hours.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  So think about what that meant.
*  Every employee had an opportunity to tell the big boss what they were working on.
*  Every employee had an opportunity to be recognized for their effort.
*  Every employee had an opportunity to get live feedback from the big boss who had a
*  comprehensive overview of everything as to what they should be doing.
*  Whoa.
*  And there's no place to hide.
*  Right.
*  Think about different it is for a company to be run that way.
*  Right.
*  Then even again the value companies generally are quite well run by by sort of business
*  standards and even that like that's a level of intensity that most value companies
*  aren't even close to.
*  Now imagine that applied to government to government.
*  And there's just and it's and again this is the kind of thing there's no law that
*  there's no reason it can't be done.
*  There's no law that prevents that.
*  There's nothing in the Constitution that says you can't do that.
*  It's a choice.
*  How the government is run is a choice on the part of the executive branch of the
*  president for how it's going to get run.
*  And there's no reason why the government can't literally be run this way.
*  And here's what's crazy.
*  The pushback against even the concept of this by leftists.
*  So leftists defending bureaucratic bloat and big government is wild to watch.
*  Which they really shouldn't be doing.
*  Which is a weird thing to have wedged themselves into.
*  My hope is they'll figure out how weird this is.
*  Do you think it's like just an ideological thing like the right wants this so we
*  oppose it.
*  I think I think they I think the left thinks they control the government.
*  Like I think 50 years ago they would have been on the other side of this of this
*  issue like like Noam Chomsky 50 years ago would have been on the other side of
*  this.
*  Would have you government power as an extension of like the state and big business
*  intertwined.
*  And you have these just term manufacturing of consent whereas like government
*  business are conspiring against you.
*  Yeah.
*  So he would have been on the other side of this.
*  But I think today's leftists think they control the government which in many ways
*  they do.
*  Well so Washington D.C.
*  that Washington D.C. voted 94 percent for Kamala.
*  Six percent for Trump.
*  Right.
*  And so OK so two data points that is data point number one data point number two
*  four of the 10 wealthiest counties in the country are suburbs of Washington D.C.
*  Wow lobbyists lobbyists.
*  Yeah.
*  They call beltway bandits.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a crazy job.
*  Is the actual term.
*  And these aren't people working for the government these are people making money
*  from right.
*  These are people sponging sponging off the government.
*  And so like yeah for for to the extent the Democrats have wedged themselves into a
*  position where they're defending this they really shouldn't.
*  They should really rethink this.
*  They should figure out how to get back to the correct mentality on this that they
*  used to have.
*  If there's less government bloat then there's less tax dollars.
*  You don't you don't you don't need as much money to fund these things.
*  There's like people can be taxed less.
*  There can be more allocation of these funds towards these social programs that we
*  all want.
*  You know most federal workers never came back to work.
*  Really.
*  Yeah.
*  They work from home.
*  Most most.
*  Yeah.
*  What percent.
*  Very large percentage something like half just literally just never came back.
*  Wow.
*  Then they still by the way still draw paycheck they're still on their jobs but
*  literally they're not in the office or in some cases they have an agreement where
*  there's one agency I won't name but there's one agency where there's there were
*  the this.
*  OK here's another great thing.
*  There are agencies of the federal government whose workforces are both civil
*  servants civil civil service protections and unionized entirely paid for by the
*  taxpayer.
*  But they both have civil service protections which by the way are totally made
*  up.
*  There's no concept in the Constitution of civil service protections it's just like
*  a totally made up thing and they're unionized and then there's a particular
*  agency that I know of where the union agreement the union negotiated the return
*  of the office from covid and the agreement was you have to be in the office one day
*  a month.
*  Whoa.
*  And actually what the pattern now is what they do is the employees come in on the
*  last day of the month and the first day of the following month.
*  So they only have to be there for two days for two months out of 60 days.
*  That's crazy.
*  As a consequence many of them have actually left the area right because they
*  get their government paycheck which is calibrated for living there and then they
*  go live someplace nice you know someplace nice but you know they go live in the
*  Ozarks or something where it's right cost of living is cheaper and they have a
*  bigger house.
*  And you know in theory they're working from home but like you know like is it
*  is it actually happening.
*  And this is again this is the does is one of the things that the does they've
*  already announced.
*  The thing they've said is you can work from home just not for the federal
*  government.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  And so when people are talking about like is the Doge going to be able to do
*  anything like it's just OK there's 50 percent of the federal workforce.
*  Right.
*  And as you know as a taxpayer how do you feel about that.
*  And you know to your point on paying taxes like if those people are in the
*  office and their dynamos of activity and they're making the country better.
*  Right.
*  Fair enough.
*  Of course.
*  But if they're kicking it at home.
*  Right.
*  Maybe not.
*  Yeah maybe not.
*  That's the how much oversight has there been on whether or not they've been
*  kicking it.
*  Excellent question.
*  Yeah.
*  Now it turns out there are ways there are actually there are ways to figure this
*  out.
*  So for example for many for many jobs where you have to log in to be able to
*  get access like to email you can actually check in like often you have VPNs to
*  get into the corporate network you can actually audit and you can see who's
*  been working.
*  And then there's a do you know about mouse wigglers.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  Yes programs.
*  No actually physical.
*  Oh they're physical mouse wigglers.
*  Yeah.
*  Physical mouse wigglers.
*  And so it's a physical device that holds your mouse and then intermittently
*  wiggles it.
*  And a friend of mine who runs a big tech company he just had like a nagging
*  feeling in the back of his head that maybe all of his remote workers workers
*  weren't pulling their weight.
*  And so he actually wrote himself on a weekend algorithm to inspect all the
*  mouse movements of all employees for a week.
*  And then and then he bought all 50 like mouse wigglers from China that you can
*  buy and he fingerprinted them all.
*  And he had a whole bunch of employees who were using mouse mouse wigglers.
*  Right.
*  And so how many federal employees are using mouse wigglers.
*  Right.
*  So how crazy is that that's how they can measure whether or not you're active
*  whether your mouse is moving.
*  Yeah.
*  Like what are they what are they seeing.
*  Just just a pattern of movement of the mouse.
*  That's it.
*  Well the mouse the mouse wigglers move in a way that you can fingerprint.
*  So is this like do you agree to a certain amount of disclosure of your personal
*  information while you're working.
*  Like how do you get access to mouse wigglers.
*  Oh so it's very common.
*  So in corporate environments it's very common that your company issued computer
*  has some kind of software on it that lets the company control the software and gives
*  them and gives the company some level of visibility to what you're doing.
*  And that doesn't mean that doesn't mean they're washing literally washing you.
*  But it means that they have the ability to kind of reach in and be able to be able to
*  see how much is the computer on.
*  Wow.
*  And so that's actually a reasonably reasonably common thing.
*  I heard the most ridiculous argument against this.
*  What are you going to do with all those employees that get fired.
*  Like what are you going to do with all those people who are stealing hubcaps.
*  They're making a living stealing.
*  What are you going to do if you make hubcaps stealing illegal.
*  Like what are you talking about.
*  They're essentially stealing tax dollars.
*  If they really are doing something that's totally useless and they were wasting
*  enormous amounts of money on this every year.
*  The argument that what are you going to do if those people can't do that anymore is
*  really crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  Well the answer is they can do something productive.
*  Yeah.
*  And people are more than capable.
*  You don't have to infantilize someone to say like this is the only thing they're
*  capable of doing.
*  They work for the government for 20 years.
*  This is all they can do.
*  Yeah.
*  And then by the way there's multiple knock on a positive knock on the facts if you
*  can cut government spending there's multiple knock on the facts.
*  So one is if you cut the spending you can cut the taxes and you can just the
*  private economy then just simply has more money because it hasn't been taken.
*  And so if there's less public spend there will be more private spend.
*  Right.
*  Because the money reallocates.
*  And so there might be just as much demand in the economy is just coming from people
*  choosing to buy things instead of the government forcing it.
*  So that's number one.
*  Number two you can bring down government debt which means you can bring down
*  government interest and the government today the federal government today pays
*  more interest than we pay for the Department of Defense.
*  Right.
*  But how much of that is salary.
*  No no that's just interest on the debt.
*  Right.
*  That's just interest on the old debt.
*  OK.
*  We pay like one point two billion a year right now I think is the latest number
*  which is which is just interest on debt.
*  It's not paying for any good or service is just interest on debt.
*  But again what percentage of that is the of the GDP.
*  Well so the the the total government spending is on the order of seven
*  trillion interest payments are like one point two trillion something like that.
*  Point two trillion.
*  I think that's the current number.
*  DOD is eight hundred billion a year.
*  So one point two trillion.
*  Just off the top.
*  Yeah just off the top.
*  And again no tax.
*  Nobody's benefiting from that.
*  It's just interest payments.
*  That's bananas.
*  Right.
*  And total GDP is like I don't have any I don't know.
*  It's it's it's I don't know.
*  It's 20 30 40 trillion.
*  It's you know it's much larger than that.
*  But like still it's enough.
*  This is a lot of money.
*  And in the end the total accumulated debt is 35 trillion and the total accumulated
*  debt is 35 trillion and adds another trillion of accumulated debt every hundred days.
*  Yes.
*  Oh my God it hurts my head.
*  There's a congressman actually Thomas Massey.
*  You should have.
*  So he's the one guy in Washington who talks about this and he's an
*  he's a he's one of the only libertarians and he's a he's an MIT engineer and he
*  actually designed himself a pocket lapel pin calculator of the of the government
*  debt and he wears it every day and walks around with this.
*  He walks with a little scrolling display on on his lapel and it literally counts.
*  It counts the debt and it's accurate.
*  It's pulling data from the U.S.
*  Treasury and it's actually an accurate count.
*  And so it's like 34 trillion 35 trillion 36 trillion.
*  Here's the kicker at the current pace at the compounding it'll cross the debt will
*  cross 100 trillion in the foreseeable future.
*  So he's already working on the redesign because he needs a bigger device with a
*  bigger screen to be able to display the bigger number.
*  How much anxiety do you get standing around him looking at that.
*  That's his goal.
*  Right.
*  He wants because otherwise the status quo in Washington has just let this happen.
*  Right.
*  And so anyway so another way you benefit is reduction of interest and then another
*  way you benefit is reduction of interest rates.
*  If you bring down the amount of debt in the economy you bring down interest rates
*  and then everybody else who buys things when you go to buy for a house your
*  mortgage is cheaper.
*  Right.
*  So everybody who buys anybody who ever borrows money in the real economy then
*  therefore is better off.
*  Right.
*  This is the argument against it being only good for wealthy people.
*  It's good for everybody.
*  Right.
*  Yeah it's good for anybody who ever gets car loan home loan small business loan
*  you want to bring down interest rates.
*  But this fundamental discussion of it like the argument particularly from the
*  left is that all these tax cuts deregulation all this all this is going to do is
*  make Trump supporters and Trump's people wealthier and it's going to ruin the
*  middle class and ruin the lower.
*  Everyone else is going to suffer.
*  So just observationally almost all the rich people in our society are for were for
*  common.
*  Right.
*  Really.
*  Yeah.
*  The Democratic Party.
*  So the so Democrat Republican it's a it's what they call it's a political
*  scientist called top plus bottom versus middle is the configuration.
*  So the Democratic Party is the top and the bottom versus the middle.
*  So the top is what you might call the sort of upper middle class coastal elites.
*  So it's everybody who went to the fancy schools.
*  It's everybody with a fancy jobs.
*  For sure me.
*  I guess your grandfather did.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  But it's like it's like you know it's like it's like fancy it's like high net
*  worth high income people with primarily knowledge working jobs.
*  Right.
*  So some professor reporter programmer right database expert author author
*  lawyer you know accountant banker like all the sort of you know quote elite jobs
*  and all the elite degrees by the way who all went to the top schools and got like
*  you know the elite degrees.
*  So so that's the top and then the bottom is what you call the clientele under
*  class.
*  Right.
*  So it's and it's the it's they call the rainbow coalition.
*  Right.
*  So it's all it's the minority groups.
*  Right.
*  And so it's the assembly of you know low income African Americans low income
*  Latinos you know dot dot dot dot recent immigrants recent immigrants and so
*  forth.
*  Right.
*  And so that's the Democratic coalition that they explicitly program against.
*  And then Republicans in our era Republicans are in the it's the it's the
*  middle class lower middle class.
*  You know it's all the people who don't have the fancy degrees and that are doing
*  all the actual work that's basically making the country run.
*  Right.
*  So it's everybody from the small business owner the restaurateur you know the
*  truck drivers truck drivers farmers you know all the way you know garbage men
*  and janitor like everybody who goes to work nine to five has a job probably
*  probably either small business or a physical job.
*  You know it's sort of say labor like real labor like actual labor calluses on
*  the hands.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  Kinds of stuff so kind of the so-called real economy which is why I write the
*  Republicans are concentrated in the center in the south because that's where
*  all those things are.
*  And then Democrats are concentrated in New York and California and on the coast
*  which is where all the symbolic you know creative intellectual jobs are.
*  And so so so so so so the weird thing that's happened is progress liberalism
*  progressivism started speaking for the working man right like 100 years ago it
*  spoke for the working man and now what's happened is there's been a complete
*  reorientation where the working man has separated out.
*  And then and then you saw that in this most recent election where the unions
*  the union leadership still for the most part endorsed Kamala but the rank and
*  file voted majority for Trump in a lot of cases.
*  And the data point that I remember is the teamsters voted 70 percent for Trump.
*  What do you think the motivation of all these wealthy people to vote for Kamala
*  Harris was because they feel great because they're saving the world.
*  It's amazing to be in charge and control society and decide how everything works
*  and decide who's good and who's bad.
*  And like you're elite you get to be the elite you get to make the elite decisions.
*  And if you want to be in that group you have to you got it you got it you got to
*  do this and you feel good about yourself because you feel like what you're doing
*  is on behalf of your you feel like what you're doing is on behalf of your client
*  of your clientele and it's reinforced by the echo chamber you live in.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's why the if you read if you read the media New York Times it's just it's
*  either how your times only has two articles anymore it's either how evil are
*  Republicans or how innocent and helpless are you know poor you know poor and
*  minorities or identity groups.
*  Right. And so the oppositional force and then but we're the party of good with the
*  capital because we're taking care of all these poor marginalized people.
*  So it's a very compelling you feel great about yourself.
*  Right. It's just absolutely amazing.
*  And then by the way it just so happens that the economy is wired up in a way
*  where you're going to pay a ton of money.
*  Yeah.
*  Working very hard.
*  Right.
*  It's all great.
*  And then you're completely isolated away from the lived experience of just normal
*  people which is the state that I found myself in.
*  Where it would never even occur to you to talk to a garbage man or to a somebody
*  you know running a restaurant or whatever because it's just like you're not
*  affected by the rising crime rates.
*  Right.
*  You live in a safe neighborhood.
*  Right.
*  And you've got you know you're against the wall on the border but you got a wall
*  around your house.
*  Right.
*  Right. And so you just you're in this bubble and then you only ever talk to
*  people who agree with you.
*  Right.
*  And then the media is constantly reinforcing it and then you get ostracized if
*  you disagree.
*  And that's that's the wedge like that's the way it worked.
*  Look for a long time it were for 40 50 60 years it worked as a way to gain and
*  hold political power.
*  It's just it's just gotten wedged in kind of this corner where it can no longer
*  win and so therefore it has to get reexamined.
*  So for you when you had the shift of thinking you talked to the waiter and then
*  the Hillary Clinton speech and they're like how long is it before you start
*  publicly expressing these things and like how much of a reluctance is there.
*  Also from 26 17 to 20 20 I was just like trying to figure out what the hell was
*  going on and then Kovac hit and then I was trying to figure out what the hell was
*  going on with Kovac and our business went crazy.
*  Our business caved in and had all kinds of crazy horrible things happening.
*  And we have all these companies we have hundreds of companies who are responsible
*  for startups and so we're working with them to try to keep them afloat and get
*  the money and everything.
*  But really it was I mean really the big thing was the Biden administration just
*  like flat out tried to kill us like they just came like straight at us and they
*  came straight at our founders.
*  And so and they tried to kill crypto and they were they were on their way to
*  trying to kill a I mean they were they were horrible like they were a second.
*  What was the motivation to kill a because it's because they want they want control.
*  I mean they want control they want to control they want to control in the same
*  way they can recognize the potential of it.
*  They wanted to hit it off of the path they want to control or they want to put it in
*  a headlock.
*  They don't necessarily want to stop it but they want to make sure that they control
*  it in the same way that they control social media in the same way that they
*  control the press.
*  So how are they trying to do that.
*  I mean so it's the AI is think about it as the same dynamics that cause censorship
*  to happen on social media.
*  We're also going to happen in AI.
*  And so there's a couple of steps.
*  So one is you just want a small number of companies that do AI because you want to
*  be able to put them in a headlock and control them.
*  So you basically want to give you basically want to have a government you want
*  to bless a small set of large companies with a cartel and set up a regulatory
*  structure where those companies are intertwined with the government.
*  And then you want to prevent startups from being able to enter that cartel.
*  How would they do that.
*  That's the threat to the control.
*  So it's a concept called regulatory capture.
*  And so the way this is this has happened many times for hundreds of years.
*  This is like a very well established kind of thing in economics and politics.
*  So if suppose you're a big suppose you're a big bank suppose you're Jamie
*  Diamond you run JP Morgan Chase like what's like the biggest possible threat
*  of what you could possibly face.
*  It's that there's some disruptive change that comes along that upends your entire
*  business.
*  You know your Kodak you know your Kodak you're making a ton of money on analog
*  film and digital cameras come along and you get destroyed.
*  And further in your obituaries like you're the idiot you know who blockbuster
*  video blockbuster video like that's the cautionary tale.
*  Those are the ghost stories that those guys tell around a campfire at night.
*  Just absolutely terrifying.
*  And like business schools teach you like that's the one thing you do not want to
*  do.
*  And so there's two ways to try to deal with that.
*  One is you could try to invent the future before it happens to you.
*  But that's hard because you're running a big company and you know these startups
*  are out there doing all these crazy things.
*  And can you really do that.
*  And it's hard and frisky and dangerous.
*  The other thing you can do is you can go to the government you can basically say
*  OK we're going to we would like to propose basically a trade which is we would
*  like the government to put up a wall of regulation.
*  We would like the government to put in place rules right that are potentially
*  thousands of pages long.
*  Right.
*  And in fact the more the better.
*  Right.
*  We want a very very very high bar for regulation for what's required to be in
*  this business because I'm a big company.
*  I can afford 10,000 lawyers and compliance people.
*  Right.
*  I voluntarily put myself under basically the government thumb.
*  But in return the government has erected this wall of regulation such that the
*  next startup comes along and just the next company comes along and just
*  literally can't function.
*  By the way this is literally what happened in banking.
*  So pre 2008 pre the financial crisis there were many different banks in the
*  country big big medium small and lots of new bank startups every year.
*  People would just start banks entrepreneurial banks of many different
*  kinds.
*  After the financial crisis we had this problem called the too big to fail
*  banks.
*  Right.
*  The banks were too big.
*  And so there was this legislation called Dodd-Frank which was regulatory reform
*  for banking which was going to fix the too big to fail banking problem.
*  They implemented that in 2011.
*  I call that the big bank protection act of 2011.
*  It was marketed as it was going to solve the problem of the too big to fail
*  banks.
*  What it actually did was it made them much larger.
*  So those banks are those those too big to fail banks the same ones we bailed
*  out are now much larger than they were before.
*  The banking industry has concentrated into those banks.
*  All the midsize banks are being shaken out.
*  And you know they're periodically they'll go under like our bank in Silicon Valley
*  is called Silicon Valley Bank.
*  Right.
*  It went under.
*  And this has been happening all across the economy.
*  And then since Dodd-Frank the number of new banks created in the United States
*  has dropped to zero.
*  Whoa.
*  And so the banking system is being centralized basically into 10 big banks.
*  They actually have a term they have a great term called GSIB globally
*  significant something something bank.
*  And so there's like 10 GSIBs and then basically what's going to happen is those
*  are going to consolidate basically into the into the three big banks.
*  And if you get debanked by one of the big three you're done.
*  You're absolutely done.
*  Oh my God.
*  But but think about it from the other side.
*  If you're the Treasury Secretary and you want your political enemy debanked it's
*  just a phone call.
*  Right.
*  Which is which is what has been happening which is happening under under under
*  the prior regime.
*  Wow.
*  Right.
*  And again like at that zero zero new banks.
*  Yeah zero.
*  Literally it was like cardiac arrest.
*  It was like that's it for new bank charters.
*  And we've had companies that have tried to start new banks and it's essentially
*  impossible because you have to comply with the wall of regulation.
*  You need you need to go hire your 10,000 compliance people and your lawyers but
*  you can't afford to do that because you're not big enough yet.
*  So you can't function like you can't exist like it's not it's ruled out by
*  definition is ruled out.
*  You can't do it.
*  It's not financially viable.
*  Wow.
*  Right.
*  So that happened in banking.
*  That's what they've been doing to social media.
*  This has been the same.
*  It's been.
*  By the way this has happened in many other industries.
*  By the way this this is this happened in the food food industry is greatly
*  consolidated.
*  That's a lot of what's happened in that industry as well.
*  And it's the inner it's the inner twining of government and the company.
*  Right.
*  Because at that point it's like OK is this a private company.
*  Yes.
*  Like it's still a private company.
*  It has a stock price as a CEO.
*  Does the CEO have to do everything that the relevant cabinet secretary tells
*  him to do.
*  Yes he does.
*  Why does he have to do that.
*  Because if not it's going to be investigations and subpoenas and
*  prosecutions and fratological examinations for the rest of his life.
*  Wow.
*  Everything is essentially what we accuse the CCP of doing in China.
*  It's the so so if you combine banking and social media and now AI you have
*  basically privatized social credit score.
*  Right.
*  Is where you end up with this.
*  Right.
*  And this goes back to the trucker strike thing.
*  You don't have to threaten to take away somebody's kids.
*  You just like you threaten to take away their insurance.
*  You don't threaten to take away their insurance.
*  It's not government insurance that's being taken away.
*  The same thing has happened in the insurance industry.
*  It's consolidated down to a small handful of companies.
*  They're super regulated.
*  If the government doesn't want you to have insurance you're not going to have
*  insurance and there's no constitutional right to insurance.
*  So there's no appeal process.
*  We're back to the debanking thing.
*  And so that happened in banking.
*  That's been happening in social media generally.
*  It's been happening in many other sectors and then it's happening
*  specifically in AI.
*  And what you have in AI is you have a set of CEOs of some of the big AI companies
*  that want this to happen because again their big threat is that we're going to
*  fund a startup that's going to eat their lunch.
*  Right. It's going to really screw them up.
*  So they're like look if we could just take the position we have and lock it in
*  with government protection the trade is we'll do whatever the government wants.
*  And if you assume the government is controlled by you know people who want to
*  censor and punish and cancel their political opponents that's going to come
*  right along with it.
*  And so that's why when these AI systems come out like nine times out of 10
*  they're tremendously politically biased.
*  You can do this today.
*  You just go out you go into these systems today and you just like ask you just
*  start asking like really basic questions.
*  Gemini is the best example of that right when they had multiracial Nazis.
*  The black Nazis.
*  Yeah.
*  Once again we're back to the Nazis.
*  Yes.
*  So it turns according to Gemini Hitler had an excellent DEI policy.
*  Yeah.
*  Now in reality he did not.
*  And it's important to understand that in reality he did not.
*  But yeah Gemini happily threw up black Nazis because it's because it's they
*  programmed it to be biased.
*  They programmed it in a political direction.
*  There's this guy David Rosado who's been doing these analyses on the social
*  media side where he shows the incidence rates of the rise of like all of the
*  woke like language like in the media and either similar studies that have come
*  out for the AI where you there's studies that have been done that basically show
*  the political orientation of the LLMs because you can ask them questions you
*  can ask them questions and they'll tell you and they're just like nine out of
*  ten of them are like tremendously biased.
*  And then there's a handful that aren't and then there's tremendous pressure.
*  This is one of the threats from the government is is the government basically
*  going to force our startups to come into compliance not just with their trade
*  rules but also with all of their base essentially a censorship regime on AI.
*  That's exactly like the censorship regime that we had on social media.
*  Wow that's terrifying.
*  Yeah exactly. And yes and this is my belief and what I've been trying to tell
*  people in Washington which is if you thought social media censorship was bad
*  this has the potential to be a thousand times worse.
*  And the reason is social media is important but at the end of the day it's you
*  know it's quote just people talking to each other.
*  AI is going to be the control layer on everything.
*  Right. So AI is going to be the control layer on how your kids learn.
*  School. It's going to be the control layer on who gets loans.
*  It's going to be the control layer on does your house open when you come to the
*  front door. It's going to be the control layer on everything.
*  Right. And so if that gets wired into the political system the way that the banks
*  did in the way that social media did like we are in for a very bad future.
*  And that's a big thing that we've been trying to prevent is to keep that from
*  happening. And the Biden administration was explicitly on that path like they
*  were very clearly going for that.
*  And it was it was just like crystal clear that's where it was headed.
*  And do you feel like with a second administration they'd be even more
*  emboldened to act in that direction.
*  Yes. 100 percent.
*  Another Biden another Biden administration for sure.
*  And then there was there was an open question on Kamala and the open question
*  there was just she wouldn't as you know she wouldn't declare if her issues
*  positions were the same as Biden's or if they were different.
*  Right. And so you know you could imagine a common administration that had a very
*  different approach but she she refused to clarify any of her positions.
*  Right. And so we had to assume that they would be the same as Biden's which which
*  I think is the default. Now is this a closeted sort of a perspective in
*  Silicon Valley. Do people hide these thoughts that this administration would be
*  bad for business. I mean much less now than we used to.
*  Yeah. I mean look you know you know Ilan really broke a lot of it.
*  Ilan did two things that really opened a lot of this up one is he bought Twitter
*  which really gave us a place to talk about this stuff all of us.
*  But then also he himself of course started to actually express himself and so
*  he gave a lot of the rest of us permission structure to be able to say these things.
*  And then look it's you know it's like a cascade where people are like OK apparently
*  you can now talk about things. OK I have some things to say.
*  Yeah. Well look also just they went too far they tightened the screws.
*  I mean they they really came out of the heart.
*  And so you know the harder they come at us like we didn't predict when Biden won
*  like we didn't think it would have negative effects in our business.
*  We thought yeah probably taxes will go up but like we'll just keep doing business.
*  But then they did all these things right.
*  It took a couple of years to figure out that this was not like a temporary thing
*  like this was like a concerted campaign and that they were really coming.
*  What agency specifically is involved in doing that.
*  Oh I mean it's the alphabet soup.
*  But like SEC SEC try to kill crypto very specifically.
*  FTC you know was thoroughly weaponized.
*  There's something called the CFTC which is the other part of the crypto puzzle
*  commodities futures crypto.
*  There's crypto that's a security.
*  There's some forms of crypto that are security in the SEC regulates.
*  There's other kinds of crypto that are a commodity that the CFTC regulates.
*  Is this the CFPB I mentioned earlier.
*  So the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau right decided that they were also going to
*  regulate a I which they just volunteered for.
*  And then you know the FAA the FAA killed the drone industry years ago.
*  The reason why we don't have the reason why the Chinese are winning in the drone the
*  drone wars is because the FAA basically made drones illegal in the U.S.
*  years ago. So like the FAA has been a big problem.
*  You know the what is it the FAA also the FAA.
*  When you say made drones illegal but you can still buy drones like what have they
*  done.
*  So legally you cannot fly a drone in the U.S.
*  that is beyond line of sight if you don't have a pilot's license.
*  Wow.
*  Which means if you're a U.S.
*  drone manufacturer you have to build a system that enforces that regulation.
*  So you have to handicap your ability.
*  Yes. So either the either the U.S.
*  drone needs to either not fly beyond line of sight which is not very useful right.
*  Or it needs to somehow validate.
*  We only have customers that have pilot licenses.
*  China there's no such restriction.
*  And the Chinese we have because we run a more open economy the Chinese drones you
*  can just buy in the U.S.
*  and use however you want.
*  Technically as the user of the drone you're out of compliance with the law but they
*  ignore that part. They just punish the American drone makers.
*  Wow.
*  And that's why that's why Chinese own the drone market and that's why 90 percent of
*  the drones used by the U.S.
*  military and by U.S.
*  police are Chinese made drones.
*  Which again sounds like a terrible security risk is a very bad idea because every
*  Chinese drone is both a potential surveillance platform and a potential weapon.
*  Oh criminy.
*  Yes.
*  Well I've seen the advancements in Chinese drones in particular the choreographed
*  dances that they do in the sky where they had to see the dragon one.
*  Yeah. See if you could find that Jamie Chinese dragon drone display it's like one
*  of the largest ones they ever did.
*  It's unbelievable how much more advanced they are.
*  Yeah. And I will tell you the Biden administration had zero interest in addressing
*  this like worse than zero.
*  Like just I would say absolute contempt for the idea of a U.S.
*  drone industry. Yeah.
*  So let's watch this thing.
*  So you can go full screen on that.
*  Like this is just a grid in the sky.
*  Look at this.
*  They're flying up together.
*  Yeah.
*  They did one that was at night Jamie because they're all lit up.
*  It's just a little.
*  Oh OK.
*  Imagine those with guns.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  Coming at you.
*  Right.
*  Well we get to see some of that in Ukraine.
*  Yeah.
*  100 percent.
*  Absolutely.
*  Yeah.
*  We've seen those suicide drones like look at this.
*  That is that dragon in the sky is drones that are all lit up.
*  I mean that is unbelievable.
*  It even has a puff of fire coming out of its mouth.
*  Yeah.
*  That's incredible.
*  If they send that at a football stadium during a game with grenades on those drones.
*  Oh my God.
*  Carnage.
*  Dude don't even put that out there.
*  Don't put that voodoo on me Ricky Bobby.
*  Sorry.
*  Look at that heart in the sky with a heartbeat.
*  Correct.
*  This is insane.
*  Correct.
*  Yes.
*  It's so incredible.
*  Yes.
*  They had a little one like that that played over the Eminem concert at when I was at Coda
*  at the Circuits of the Americas here.
*  They had this giant Eminem concert like 100000 people there and then afterwards they had
*  like drones in the sky that did little dances.
*  Chinese drones.
*  I bet.
*  I bet they were.
*  They weren't like this though.
*  They didn't didn't.
*  Wasn't it that level.
*  I mean that that's unbelievable.
*  Enjoy the show while you can.
*  That's crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a Chinese thing only.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know.
*  Yeah.
*  Look DoD wasn't these soldiers in the field.
*  It's very common soldiers just soldiers.
*  Normal normal ground soldiers in the field carry drones in their backpacks because they
*  want to be able to see what's around the building or up on the roof.
*  Yeah.
*  And these are Chinese.
*  Chinese drones.
*  And every single one of them can be taken over by China and used for whatever they want.
*  Oh my God.
*  Anytime they want.
*  Is the Trump administration on this?
*  They're very they're aware.
*  I don't know what they'll do.
*  You know it's somewhere in the priority order of the things that they're dealing with.
*  They are.
*  Yes they are well aware of this.
*  And well it's the kind it's the kind of thing I would hope that would get some attention.
*  Yeah.
*  Well this is the brings us back to the UAP thing because if that's what we're seeing
*  we're seeing super sophisticated Chinese drones operate on some novel propulsion system.
*  That's not good.
*  And that could be because they put ridiculous regulations on drone manufacturers in
*  America.
*  That's right.
*  And they got way ahead of us.
*  Yeah that's right.
*  Yeah.
*  These are bad.
*  These are bad.
*  You're just opening my eyes to this.
*  I always had this rose colored glasses view of our society versus the Chinese society.
*  Our society is more open.
*  So people can innovate and come up with new startups all these crazy ideas because there's
*  so much freedom in America.
*  They don't have to deal with the government being involved in every business.
*  Silly me.
*  Well silly me I was wrong.
*  So this is my argument.
*  This is my argument I make geopolitically in D.C.
*  Which is our if you imagine that the 21st century is going to be let's say a contest
*  between the U.S.
*  and China the same way that in the 20th century it was the U.S.
*  versus the Soviet Union and like contest competition Cold War maybe hot war.
*  Yeah like that's that's the basic fundamental kind of geopolitical puzzle of the 21st
*  century.
*  Then you want to think very clearly about the strengths and weaknesses of both yourselves
*  and about the other side.
*  And then as you think about how to beat the other guy is the answer to become more like
*  them or more like yourself.
*  Maxine Waters made that argument when it comes to social digital scores and cryptocurrency
*  and a centralized digital currency.
*  She was talking about that in order to compete with China we have to come up with a centralized
*  digital currency.
*  Which in my view is exactly the wrong thing.
*  Yes I heard that I was like that's a terrible idea.
*  It's exactly the right thing to be like China to compete with China.
*  It's exactly the wrong thing.
*  It's exactly the wrong thing.
*  You don't want that because because because as you know the China system has its problems
*  like they terrorize their own population directly.
*  They do impose the social credit score.
*  They do.
*  They do all this stuff.
*  And then by the way here's here's something we have going for us which is the Chinese
*  system has turned on capitalism.
*  Xi Jinping is not a capitalist and he there is a broad based crackdown on private business
*  in China to the point.
*  The friend of mine invests one of the leading investors in China.
*  He said every single Chinese tech founder has either left China or wants to leave China.
*  They're all trying to get their money out and they're all trying to get their families
*  out because it's now too dangerous to run a tech company in China because the government
*  might just snatch you like literally physically snatch you at any point.
*  And you may or may not come back.
*  And then every Chinese CEO has a political officer of the Chinese Communist Party sitting
*  down the hall who can come in and override your decisions anytime he wants to.
*  And by the way and drag you into training.
*  This is a great thing. OK. So you're sitting here you're the CEO of a company with 50
*  billion revenue and 100000 employees.
*  And this guy from the CCP comes in and pulls you and you sit in the conference room down
*  the hall for seven hours getting grilled on how well you understand Marx.
*  Right. So like that actually happens.
*  Right. So political officers.
*  And that's the kind of thing that happened in the Soviet Union.
*  And that's the kind of thing that happens in China.
*  So you'd rather be a CEO in the US than in China for sure.
*  As long as the US system actually stays open where you can actually get all the benefits
*  of all the power of all these incredibly smart people building companies and building
*  products. But and that's why this administration freaked us out so much is because it felt
*  like they were trying to become way more like China.
*  See I was not nearly as aware as I should have been about all these things you've
*  saying. I didn't know this.
*  I didn't know about the banks and I certainly didn't know that they were cracking down on
*  A.I. the same way they cracked down on social media.
*  The A.I. thing was very alarming.
*  We had we had meetings this spring that were the most alarming meetings I've ever been
*  in where they were taking us through their plans and it was what kind of can you talk
*  about it basically just full government full government control like this sort of thing.
*  There will be a small number of large companies that will be completely regulated control
*  by the government. They told us they told us they just said don't even start don't even
*  start startups like don't even bother.
*  Like there's just no way there's no way that they can succeed.
*  There's no way that we're going to permit that to happen.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah. They said this is already over.
*  It's going to be two or three companies and we're just going to we're going to we're going
*  to control them. And that's that like this is already finished.
*  Oh my God.
*  No. When you leave a meeting like that what do you do.
*  You go endorse Donald Trump.
*  Oh my God.
*  And again like I'll tell you like you know like like because I'm going to get a lot of
*  you know the flak I'm going to get for this is he's just a crazy whatever right winger.
*  But like I was a Democrat.
*  I was like a Democrat. I was I supported Bill Clinton in 92.
*  I supported Clinton in 96.
*  I supported Gore who I knew very well in 2000.
*  I knew John Kerry. I supported him in 04.
*  I supported Obama.
*  I supported Hillary in 16.
*  Like I was like a Democrat in good standing.
*  And then.
*  Are you completely out in the cocktail circuit now.
*  Like are you allowed to hang out with people.
*  So there's now this is actually true.
*  There's now two kinds of dinner parties in Silicon Valley.
*  They fractured.
*  They fractured cleanly in half.
*  There's the ones where every person there believes every single thing that was in the
*  New York Times that day.
*  Which by the way is often very different than whatever was in the New York Times six
*  months ago. But everybody has fully updated their views for that day.
*  And that's what they talk about at the dinner party.
*  And I am no longer invited to those nor nor do I want to go to them.
*  And then and then there's the other kind which is you know David Sacks and like all
*  these guys and all these people and you know just this growing universe.
*  You know it's a microcosm of what's happening more broadly in the culture which is
*  like hey let's actually get together and talk about things.
*  Right. But it's so much more comforting when it's you guys and not the my pillow guy.
*  You know what I mean. No disrespect Mike to the my pillow guy.
*  But you know I'm saying like I want people that are smarter than me to be saying these
*  things. That's what helps.
*  It helps when you say well this person actually knows what they're talking about.
*  They're very well informed and they understand the repercussions.
*  They understand like what's been coming their way.
*  And there's people like yourself that could speak about these.
*  The plans that you're laying out what they were trying to do with A.I.
*  is fucking terrifying.
*  That should terrify everybody.
*  Where you have bureaucrats are now in control of potentially the most
*  the biggest ancient of change in the history of the human race.
*  Potentially. And you're going to let what the people that can't even balance the
*  budget. People that don't know what the fuck is going on.
*  That's that sounds insane.
*  And look my hope.
*  I think I think under Clinton and Gore I think that they they did they dealt with
*  this very I mean look they dealt with the Internet very differently than the current
*  cropper are dealing with these technologies.
*  Well it was very different.
*  It was very different but also they were much more Clinton and Gore in particular
*  were much more understanding that you could.
*  So there used to be this thing I call the deal with a capital D and the deal was you
*  could be and this is what I was you could be a tech founder you could start a
*  private company you could create a tech product.
*  Everybody loved you. It was great glowing press coverage the whole thing.
*  You take the company public it employs a lot of people creates a lot of jobs you
*  make a lot of money at some point you cash out and then you donate all the money
*  to charity and everybody thinks you're a hero.
*  Right.
*  Just great. Right.
*  And this is how it ran for a very long time.
*  And this was the deal.
*  This was you know the deal.
*  This is Clinton and Gore with 100 percent support of that and they were 100 percent
*  pro capitalism in this way and 100 percent pro tech.
*  And they actually did a lot to foster this kind of environment.
*  And basically what happened is the last 15 years or so Democrats culminating in
*  this administration basically broke every part of that deal for people in my world
*  like every single part of that was shattered right where just like technology
*  became presumptively evil.
*  Right. And like you know if you're a business person you were presumptively a bad
*  person and the technology was presumptively had bad effects and dot dot dot and then
*  they were going to regulate you and try to kill you and quash you.
*  And then the kicker was philanthropy became evil.
*  And this is a real culture change in the last five years that I hope will reverse
*  now which is philanthropy now is a dirty word on the left because it's the private
*  person choosing to give away the money as opposed to the government choosing a way
*  to give the money.
*  So I'll give you the ultimate case that here's where I radicalized on this topic.
*  So you'll recall some years back Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla you know
*  they have a ton of money in Facebook stock.
*  They created a nonprofit entity called Chan Zuckerberg Initiative which which the
*  original mission was to literally cure all disease.
*  And this could be like you know 200 billion dollars going to cure all disease.
*  Right. So like a big deal.
*  They said they committed to doing it.
*  Ninety nine percent of their assets to this to this new foundation.
*  They got brutally attacked from the left and the attack was they're only doing it
*  to save money on taxes.
*  Now basic mathematics you don't give away 99 percent of your money to save money on
*  taxes. Right.
*  But it was a vicious attack.
*  It was like a very very aggressive attack.
*  And the fundamental reason for the attack was how dare they treat that money like
*  it's their own.
*  How dare they decide where it goes.
*  Instead tax rates for billionaires should go to 90 something percent.
*  The government should take the money and the government should allocate it and that
*  would be the morally proper and correct thing to do.
*  What do you think is the root of that?
*  Kind of thinking utopian is a utopian collectivism.
*  You know it's the socialism that socialism.
*  Yeah it's the core idea of socialism like the core idea is this is sort of radical
*  egalitarianism.
*  Everybody should be exactly the same.
*  All outcomes should be exactly the same.
*  Everything should be completely fair.
*  And some root of it has to be an envy.
*  Of course. Yeah.
*  Envy resentment.
*  Yes.
*  Nietzsche had this great term called resentment and it's like turbocharging.
*  Resentment is envy resentment and bitterness that is so intense that it causes an
*  inversion of values and the things that used to be good become bad and the things that
*  used to be bad become good.
*  Right.
*  And that's how philanthropy becomes bad.
*  Philanthropy becomes bad because it should be the state operating on behalf of the
*  people as a whole who are handing out the money not the individual.
*  I was not aware of that blowback.
*  I would have loved to have been a little more specific.
*  I mean I think that's the thing.
*  I think that's the thing.
*  I think that's the thing.
*  I was not aware of that blowback.
*  I would have loved to read some of those comments.
*  I would like to go to their page and see what else they comment on.
*  I'll give you another example. Here's another radicalizing moment.
*  My friend Sheryl Sandberg, who I worked with very closely for a long time at Facebook.
*  By the way, Democrat, you know, liberal, by the way, endorsed Kamala, like very much
*  not on the same page as me on these things.
*  She actually worked in the Clinton administration, you know, died in the World
*  Democrats. She wrote this book called Lean In about 12 years ago.
*  It's this sort of feminist manifesto and it basically said...
*  Lean in?
*  Lean in.
*  And the thesis of Lean In was that women in their lives and careers could
*  quote unquote lean in.
*  She said what she observed in a lot of meetings was the men were leaning into the
*  table and sitting like in front and then the women were like leaning back and
*  waiting to be called on.
*  She said the women should lean in.
*  It became a metaphor for her for women should like lean in on their careers.
*  They should like aggressively advocate for themselves to get like raises and
*  promotions.
*  Like men do.
*  They should basically, women should basically become more aggressive in the
*  workplace and then therefore perform better.
*  And so it was like it was a manifesto to women basically saying be more confident,
*  be more assertive, be more aggressive, be more successful.
*  And I read the draft of the book when she was writing it and I said, well, you
*  realize you've written a right wing manifesto.
*  Right. And she looks at me like I've lost my mind, right?
*  Because she's a lifelong, lifelong leftist.
*  She's like, what do you mean?
*  And I'm like, this book is a statement that women have agency.
*  This book is a statement that the things that women choose to do will lead to
*  better results.
*  That's what people believe on the right.
*  On the left, what people believe is that women are only always and ever victims.
*  Wow.
*  And if a woman doesn't succeed in a career, it's because she's being
*  discriminated against.
*  And so I said, I said, I predicted when this book comes out, the right wingers
*  are going to think it's great and you're going to get it.
*  Like the left is going to come at you because you're violating the fundamental
*  principle of the left, which is anybody who does less well as a victim, which in
*  that case is exactly what happened.
*  By the way, the reviews are all by women and they tore into her like in every
*  major publication, they just like completely ripped her.
*  How dare this rich entitled woman be telling us, you know, these would be
*  telling women that they're not victims and that they're, you know, that they
*  have all this agency because every denial of sexism, right?
*  It's denial of oppression.
*  Wow.
*  Cause imagine if a man wrote a book like that for men, right?
*  That was patriarchy, right?
*  That's, you know, that'd be, but men wouldn't attack it.
*  Oh, right.
*  Exactly.
*  Right.
*  It would be a guidebook.
*  Yeah.
*  This is how you kick ass and get ahead.
*  Yeah.
*  We call it self-help.
*  Lean in, bro.
*  You lean in.
*  Lean in, bro.
*  Exactly.
*  Right.
*  Wow.
*  That's crazy.
*  Is she going to attack for that?
*  So again, it's this, it's the inversion.
*  It's the resentment.
*  It's the inversion, which is like advocating on your own behalf and choosing
*  to do things that make you more successful.
*  What was her reaction to that?
*  I would say she was, I don't want to speak for her, but she was not, not pleased.
*  I mean, she was.
*  But also was she shocked that you were correct?
*  Did you have a follow-up conversation with her?
*  What did she say?
*  We've talked about it a lot.
*  Like, God damn it, Mark, how'd you see that one coming?
*  So she was in the, but the answer is she was, her, her worldview of how these
*  things worked was from a different, it was from the Clinton-Gore era in which
*  you could, in which you could say things like that, you could talk like that.
*  Yes.
*  And by the time the book came out, it was already into the second Obama term
*  heading it, right?
*  And it was, and then the woke stuff started.
*  And then at that point you could no longer say things like that.
*  And everything got classified through this very hard edged, right?
*  Us versus them, right?
*  Oppressor versus oppressed.
*  Oh boy.
*  You know, kind of mindset.
*  And so.
*  It's such a, it's such a contrast to what we hoped would happen
*  when Obama would be president.
*  That's right.
*  My thought was, okay, like there's still some racism, but clearly if you're the
*  baddest motherfucker, you can get ahead.
*  Like you can win the country will vote for you.
*  That's not what happened.
*  No.
*  And you can win again.
*  You can win twice.
*  You win twice.
*  And, and be like, I've always said up until I've lost a lot of respect for him
*  some of the things that he said during this election cycle, because I think they
*  got desperate and they just resorted to actual lies.
*  And I thought this is crazy to see him lying, especially the very fine people
*  hoax, and we played the video back and forth of what Obama said he said and
*  what he actually said.
*  And it's pretty shocking because he's very explicit.
*  You know, he's saying not white nationalists, not neo-Nazis.
*  They should be condemned.
*  He says that very clearly.
*  That's not what I'm talking about.
*  Talk about people who are protesting the taking down of the statue.
*  And when you see a guy like Obama do that, it's such a bummer because he was
*  the guy for me that was like our best spokesman.
*  He was like, here's a guy that came from a single family or single parent
*  household, it wasn't some rich entitled kid who was given everything in life.
*  He's this brilliant speaker.
*  He he's like, he's handsome.
*  He represents like what we're hoping for.
*  We're hoping for a colorblind society.
*  It just treats people on the merit of who they are and anyone can achieve.
*  And look, here he is.
*  He made it.
*  And then all of a sudden identity politics goes through the fucking roof and victim
*  mentality becomes a thing that people choose to side with.
*  And it just gets real weird for a long time.
*  That's right. That's right.
*  And like I said, I hope they can find their way back.
*  But this lady still on team Kamala.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  She got a few lessons out of that, but not all of them.
*  Well, no, this is if you're, you know, if you've been a lifelong Democrat, this is
*  a if you've been a lifelong Democrat.
*  And if that's, you know, if that is in this quarter, a lot of people's value
*  systems, then it's a real challenge.
*  You know, oh, yeah, it's my parents when your movement goes in directions.
*  Well, yeah. And there's, you know, right.
*  And you can choose you can choose to follow.
*  You can choose to follow into the, you know, the craziest version of it.
*  Or you can choose to say, you know what?
*  Like, I'm still not going to switch sides, but at least I'm going to advocate
*  right for my team to come back.
*  Yeah. This is Richie Torres.
*  This guy is a congressman in in in Queens, I think, or the Bronx.
*  He's actually he actually started out.
*  Everybody thought he was going to be a far lefty because he's gay.
*  He's black. He's Latino.
*  He was like he was like at least associated with the squad early on.
*  And he's like one of the guys in the Democratic Party who has now stood up
*  and he's been doing this in public for the last two weeks saying clearly we have
*  to get back to sense like we have to get back to common sense.
*  We have to get back to moderation.
*  Yeah, we have to we have to have law enforcement.
*  We have to have you know, we can't have crime in the streets.
*  We have to have a border.
*  You know, we have to we have to get we Democrats have to get back to moderation
*  and sense. And so he is hoping to lead the party.
*  That's great. That I think he's we support him.
*  And I think he's like a really I think he's a very impressive guy.
*  So there are people like and he's young and very energetic and, you know,
*  I think he has a very bright future.
*  But that's the kind of person who could lead the party.
*  Well, the big Nietzschean shift was when Dick Cheney endorsed Kamala and everybody
*  cheered. If there's not a better example than that, please tell me what it is,
*  because that one was fucking nuts.
*  Like Dick Cheney was always the hard right.
*  Like during the Bush administration, all the lefties looked at him like that was
*  Satan. That's right.
*  He was the profiteer. That's right.
*  He was the the manipulator.
*  He was the guy pulling the strings.
*  Yeah. He was the CEO of Hal Burton.
*  That came. The whole thing was so crazy.
*  And to see, oh, Dick Cheney just endorsed Kamala and everybody's like, yay.
*  Look, Dick Cheney's on our side.
*  Like, what the fuck are you guys talking about?
*  This is this is the best shift of it, right?
*  Yeah, that's right. That's right. That's right.
*  All of a sudden, all of a sudden, we're all all of a sudden we're all neocons.
*  All of a sudden, as you said, all of a sudden we're pro war.
*  It's like, wait, wait, you know, because like, as you know, like the Democrats,
*  you know, the Democrats used to be the anti-war party.
*  Yes. They were the anti-war party for a very long time.
*  Yes. Yes.
*  And yeah.
*  Except back when they were trying to keep slavery in.
*  That's part of the problem.
*  That was a different.
*  People don't realize that.
*  It was a different era. But, you know, like coming out of Vietnam,
*  they were definitely the anti-war party for like, you know, 30 years.
*  But isn't that a shift as well? Yeah, it was.
*  But the shift of the Republicans from back in the day being Abraham Lincoln
*  and trying to get rid of slavery.
*  And the Democrats fighting to keep it like this, these weird ideological swings.
*  They happen.
*  And, you know, we're still attached to the idea of being a Democrat.
*  It's like being a Clinton Democrat.
*  Right. We're in this weird sort of
*  denial of what the ideology actually stands for,
*  versus how we think of ourselves when we say, I'm a Democrat.
*  I am a good person, you know, I I support civil rights, women's rights,
*  but but but but but but but but down the line, I'm a Democrat.
*  And if you go against that well now you're against all these things that you know to be inherently important for society
*  Yeah, that's right. They gotcha. Yeah, they got you. They roped you into some crazy thing
*  We're supporting war and then there was the big faction, right? There's the big free Palestine versus support Israel
*  Yeah, cuz the left always supported Israel
*  Yeah, 100% and then all of a sudden there's just free Palestine movement which divides the left even further. Yeah
*  There's this book. There's a book written some years back by this guy Norman Pothorax and the script
*  Why are Jews liberal?
*  Right, and he was a right-wing. He was right-wing to a very important Jewish thinker American Jewish thinker of like in the 60s 70s 80s
*  And he's like he's basically it's like basically he had this thesis that like these Jewish liberal voters in the US like basically
*  are voting against ultimately they're voting for the wrong team because what they don't understand basically is that this is sort of a path number one to
*  antisemitism which is what's happened but number two that basically you're never gonna have long-term support for Israel from the left because
*  Israel the basic concept of Israel violates that you know
*  The idea that Israel is like literally a religious ethnostate
*  Right, and that's like inherently a right-wing idea not a left-wing right like the left doesn't have room for and a military superpower
*  And a military right and is able to write is able to write is able to and it's run by a former special forces operator
*  They're very yes, very yes a very capable. Yes, very capable soldier. It's a fucking assassin
*  Exactly. Yeah, and so, you know, he argued I don't know. It's like whatever 20 years ago
*  He's like this is headed in the wrong direction and but you know
*  The argument was ignored at the time and then you know, at least a lot of my Jewish friends after October 7th
*  You know, they were completely horrified, you know to find out for example, the DEI was actually anti-jewish
*  Right, which is what everybody learned with the scandals at the universities, right?
*  And it's like, you know, there's two ways of looking at that one is oh my god the DEI is anti-jewish
*  Therefore we need to add shoes to the DEI
*  Scorecard, right? Well, what was the other the heads of Harvard and was it? I might was it Yale? No, it was Harvard
*  MIT in Columbia. Yeah, that was yeah, that's right
*  That was just so in everyone's face and so bananas
*  Well, and then we saw that you have right inside then we saw is that this the same sort of radicalized left had actually slid
*  It's not just anti-semitism and not just anti-israel, but also pro. I mean ultimately pro-terrorist pro Hamas
*  Yeah, you know the new acronym
*  LGBT H. Oh
*  But there's a bunch of other stuff in there now. There's Q. There's two-spirit
*  I know but you gotta get H in there now for Hamas. Oh boy. Really? Of course, of course, of course
*  And so so like yeah, I bring it I bring it up just as an example
*  Just as an example of it's the kind of realignment
*  Yeah
*  a lot of Jewish Americans now are having to kind of rethink fundamental questions about
*  Political structure and alliances and who they should be part of and who they shouldn't be part of so I think to your point
*  I think like the whole country is going through I think we're going through the first like
*  Profound political realignment probably since the 1960s. Yeah, which is which is when everything shifted between Johnson and Nixon
*  In the south I think we're going through like the most profound version of that right now
*  And I think it's it's something like the multi-ethnic working-class coalition, you know, they came together around Trump
*  You know basically again against this sort of super exaggerated elite plus underclass, you know
*  Kind of structure that the Democrats have built for themselves and it just turns out there's just a lot more people in the middle
*  And so I think but but by the way including a lot of a lot of black people a lot of black people
*  Black vote for Trump is way up Hispanic vote for Trump is way up
*  Right vote for Trump is way up way up gay vote is like all of yes
*  All of the identity groups the Democrats relied on all these years or union vote is for Trump
*  I'm sure you've seen the
*  Map the electoral map of California. Yeah, 2024 and 2020. Yes in contrast. It's a crazy red wave
*  It's going through across the whole the most the state is red now. Those of us on the coast are gonna get pushed into the ocean
*  Yes
*  Well, I think you know, maybe the other way we were talking about the hopeful way that the Democrats will wake up
*  Yeah, and come up with a more
*  Reasonable. I mean there's obviously clear cultural pushback a lot of these crazier crazier issues
*  Yeah, and I mean like the giant pushback from women about biological men competing against women
*  I mean, this is a giant one where women are psycho
*  Listen, we created Title 9 for a reason like we we want women's sports to be for women
*  You can't have them for mentally ill men that think that they can be able to
*  Just decide they're a woman and compete against women which is what it is in a lot of places
*  You don't even have to get tested. There's not like some sort of a hormone protocol
*  it's just like it's just what your identity is which is just nuts and
*  That's one of the things that I think a lot of people on the left are having a really hard time
*  Justifying. Yeah, right. Because how can you how can you deny a victim group? Right, right
*  I mean in the full version of that idea on the extreme version ideology
*  You cannot deny anybody you cannot deny a victim claim
*  Well, it also comes with this weird caveat where you have to deny the existence of perverts, right?
*  Because a pervert all they have to do is say I identify as a woman throwing a wig and now you can go hang around
*  The women's room and no one could say anything
*  well, you've you've emboldened empowered one of the worst groups in society that we've always protected women from and
*  You have to pretend they don't exist if you just want to base it solely on identity
*  especially like a self-described identity you just decide and then that's it and
*  You know, I mean there's states that have that now with prisoners that all prisoner has to do is identify
*  With being a woman and you are now housed in women's prisons
*  California has 47 of them when the last time I looked at it and there's hundreds that are waiting on like a waiting list
*  To try to get in so you have women who you know
*  especially if you're someone who's dealing with if you've ever been raped or sexually abused and now you have to share space with
*  A man who might be a fucking pervert and some of these men even have
*  Some crimes that are along those lines that they're in jail for yeah, it's crazy
*  I mean Canada is the worst at it. There's a bunch of different
*  examples of these type of people getting in
*  Female prisons and it's just it's insanity and I think the left
*  Rejects that too for the most part. There's the sensible version of the left that is like hey, yeah, I'm pro gay rights
*  Yeah, I'm pro women's rights. I'm pro civil rights. I'm pro choice. I'm pro this I'm anti-war month, but also
*  You can't let psychos just put on a fucking dress and hang out in women's rooms just because we want to be kind
*  Like that's nuts. So there has to be some and then there's legitimate trans women
*  How do you make the distinct well clearly we have to have a fucking conversation
*  And if you don't allow that conversation take place like if you go to blue sky and you type in there are only two genders
*  You're banned. Yeah, you're right there people done it. There's a bunch of people have done it. It's fun
*  Yeah, it's fun. They have like they've created a little sock puppet account
*  They they say some shit that should have been a reasonable thing to say just 20 years ago. Yeah
*  Yeah, well you make me hopeful mark. You do you do because you lay things out in like a really well thought out way
*  That is not hyperbolic and you're you're making a lot of sense. So I'm glad we talked I feel better good
*  I think the world does too. I really do
*  I mean I've talked to a lot of people even people that are Democrats. They say I feel better that Trump won
*  Every day it feels better. It's just like
*  It feels like just things are opening up. It's the Obama campaign. It's hope and change. Yeah
*  It's hope you change
*  Actually hope and change yeah, this is actually it it feels like oxygen returning. Yes. Yeah. Well, thank you very much mark
*  I really appreciate you tell everybody there's sub stack how to find you on social media
*  Oh, I'm on I'm on I'm on X under P Marque. I'm on sub stack Google me. All right ass perplexity
*  All right, ask chat GPT and it will deny that no
*  It will happily tell you that I exist at least last at least last time I checked so what about Wikipedia?
*  Yeah, we don't know. We don't know if that if Catherine is still running always pleasure mark
*  Thank you very much. Appreciate it. All right. Bye everybody
