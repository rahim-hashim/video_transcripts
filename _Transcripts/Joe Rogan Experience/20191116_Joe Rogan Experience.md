# Joe Rogan Experience #1386 - Matt Taibbi
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [November 16, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GJaLAIM1Ho)
*  So, Jamie pointed out, this congressman, is that who it is?
*  Jamie pointed this out, that there's a congressman and he released a series of tweets and the
*  first letter of all these tweets, if you put them all together, it says, Epstein didn't
*  kill himself, or did not kill himself, is that what it is?
*  It's didn't, he did.
*  How do you do the apostrophe?
*  You should have gone with did not.
*  We're sitting here with that evidence of a link.
*  Rep Paul Gosser.
*  What are the odds that this guy did this accidentally?
*  Really small, right?
*  That's kind of like one of those monkeys typing Shakespeare things.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, I don't think it could work.
*  And the thing is, he did it backwards, right?
*  So you didn't see what the puzzle was until the last tweet.
*  Who caused that?
*  Because the last tweet is an E.
*  I got a tweet from someone about 35 minutes ago that, I don't know if there's a bunch
*  of people online paying attention to it or what, but someone alerted me and a few other
*  people.
*  Does he have an image of that fucking, that crazy mask?
*  Is that in his shit too?
*  Okay.
*  He's a weirdo.
*  That might be the H of it.
*  Not until that was November 1st.
*  The V mask.
*  Yes.
*  What is that mask again?
*  V for Vendetta.
*  What was it representative of?
*  It's the Guy Fawkes mask.
*  Yes, that's right.
*  That's right.
*  Yeah, so this guy is, he's thinking along alternative lines of thought, but that is
*  really an interesting way of saying it.
*  Alphabetry, that's called.
*  Yeah.
*  He's making a bunch of tweets.
*  Don't ever address it.
*  Just leave it there.
*  Walk away.
*  Just leave it there.
*  Yeah.
*  Lewis Carroll was famous for that.
*  Was he?
*  Yeah, that was one of, he did a lot of sort of tricks with words.
*  Did you read the book Odalascher Bach?
*  No.
*  Yeah, there's a whole bunch of stuff in there about people who used, who put puzzles in
*  text.
*  It's kind of a thing that people did, I guess, back more in the 18th century and before.
*  Well this Epstein case is probably the most blatant example of a public murder, of a crucial
*  witness I've ever seen in my entire life, or anybody's ever seen.
*  And the minimal amount of outrage about this, the minimal amount of cover, it's fucking
*  fascinating.
*  I mean, what's amazing to me, just as somebody who works in the media, is that this was shaping
*  up to be the biggest news story in history.
*  And the instant he died, or was died, or however you want to call it, the story just fell off
*  the face of the earth.
*  It's like nobody's doing anything about it.
*  And I don't 100% understand that.
*  I mean, I get it why that's happening, but it's just amazing.
*  Well, when the woman from ABC, what was her name?
*  Amy Rose, that lady.
*  The one who- Robach.
*  Robach, yeah.
*  She had the frustrated moment that she called it, a frustrating private moment.
*  When she was talking about having the scoop and having that story and them squashing it.
*  This is all stuff that everybody used to think was conspiracy.
*  Everybody used to think this was stoner talk.
*  This was, you know, you know what I mean?
*  This is stuff where people are just delusional.
*  They believe all kinds of wacky conspiracies, but the reality is much less complicated.
*  Well, this is not possible.
*  This is one of those things that's so obvious.
*  It's so in everyone's face.
*  Well, there's a couple of things going on, because there are many different ways this
*  can play out.
*  I mean, you could have a news director who just sort of instinctively decides, well,
*  we can't do that story because I might want to have Will and Kate on later, or I might
*  want to have this politician on later.
*  And it's not like anybody tells them necessarily that we can't do this.
*  They just decide it's too hot.
*  If you grow up in this system and you've been in the business for a long time, you
*  just you have all these things that are drilled into you at almost like the cellular level
*  about what you can and cannot get into.
*  And I think there but there were some explicit things that happened with Epstein, too.
*  I mean, there were a lot of news agencies that killed stories about him.
*  You know, and we're hearing about some of them, Vanity Fair, this thing, you know.
*  So yeah, it's bad.
*  It's terrible.
*  Yeah.
*  When I found out that Clinton flew no less than 26 times on a plane with Epstein, I was
*  like, dude, I haven't flown that many times with my mom.
*  And how long did he know Epstein?
*  Yeah, I don't know.
*  But I mean, they have that many flights to have the Secret Service people involved.
*  I mean, that's incredibly bold.
*  What was he doing?
*  Just girls?
*  Is Clinton that much of a hound that he would go that deep into the well that many times,
*  26 times?
*  Well, that's the thing about the Epstein story that makes no sense to me.
*  Like I thought that the percentage of people who were out and out, like perverts who had
*  a serious problem like with pedophilia or whatever, it was pretty small, you know.
*  But they had a lot of people coming in and out of this compound.
*  And it just seems like it's a very strange story.
*  What were they really up to?
*  I have no idea.
*  And was it all a blackmail scheme?
*  It's just so strange.
*  Well, it seems like the pedophilia aspect of it might be directly connected to Epstein
*  himself.
*  Like he might be the one that has a problem with girls that are like 16 and he likes them
*  very or he did like them.
*  But with the other guys, it could just be girls.
*  Could be, yeah.
*  I mean, that's why it's so crazy.
*  How could it be that these, but maybe it's not.
*  But they must, but they knew who he was.
*  Yeah, but they probably didn't know the extent of it.
*  Probably not.
*  Yeah.
*  Up until a point.
*  Up until he was arrested.
*  Right.
*  And then they're like, oh, well, then that's when everybody backed off of him, right?
*  Yes.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I'm not 100%.
*  Yeah.
*  I haven't covered this story in depth.
*  I only really got into it a little bit.
*  We need you.
*  We need you in this one.
*  You're the guy.
*  This is a tough one.
*  I mean, because it mixes a lot of things that are very tough to cover.
*  Yes.
*  The intelligence world is very tough to cover.
*  It's hard to get stories out of there that they don't want you to have.
*  And this is like the mother of all stories in terms of that.
*  And they're just little breadcrumbs here and there, that whole thing about Acosta.
*  The Vanity Fair quote from him is that when he said that when he looked at the case, he
*  didn't do it because I was told he belonged to intelligence.
*  Yes.
*  What does that mean?
*  Who's intelligence?
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like what agency?
*  What for?
*  And then you pair that with things like, I have friends on Wall Street who tell me, I've
*  never heard a single instance of this guy actually having a trade.
*  So what was this hedge fund doing?
*  I mean, if you think about it, a hedge fund is a perfect way to do blackmail because you
*  can just have people putting money in and out all the time and it would look like investment.
*  So very strange story.
*  Well Eric Weinstein had a conversation with him.
*  Eric Weinstein with Peter Teal Capital.
*  Right.
*  He's like, this guy doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Financially.
*  He's an actor.
*  Right.
*  This is nonsense.
*  Right.
*  That was his initial almost instantaneous response.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And what real clients did he ever have?
*  What did he trade in?
*  Has he got a billion dollars or whatever he had?
*  Yeah.
*  Half a billion.
*  Under management.
*  Yeah.
*  That's ridiculous.
*  Why does the guy who owns Victoria's Secrets give him a $70 million home in New York City?
*  Like what?
*  I mean these are all things that would have been really interesting to get into, you know.
*  If he didn't try to kill himself.
*  If the suicide didn't happen to him like in The Wire.
*  Poor fella.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just so unfortunate.
*  Yeah.
*  So unfortunate that the cameras died.
*  So unfortunate he sustained an injury that you usually only get through strangulation.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  Someone murders you.
*  He fell on the ground and accidentally broke his hyoid bone.
*  Yeah.
*  Happens all the time.
*  Whatever.
*  No big deal.
*  So bizarre.
*  I can't stand conspiracy theories.
*  I'm one of these people who doesn't like reading.
*  But I can't make this story work in a way that isn't, you know, conspiratorial.
*  Well that's the thing.
*  It's like it gets to a point where you're like, okay, even Michael Shermer who runs
*  Skeptic Magazine, he's like, wait a minute, the cameras were not working?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean it's a bad excuse.
*  This seems like a conspiracy.
*  Fucking when Michael Shermer, that guy doesn't believe in anything.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  He's down the line on virtually every single thing that's ever happened.
*  He doesn't believe in any conspiracies.
*  Well, how do you, what's the innocent explanation for any of this?
*  There's none.
*  It doesn't make any sense.
*  You can't spin it in any way to make it not a crazy conspiracy theory.
*  Especially when the brother hires a doctor to do an autopsy.
*  Oh yeah.
*  And the doctor says, this guy was fucking murdered.
*  Right.
*  Yeah, Michael Baden, the famous guy from the HBO autopsy show.
*  Right.
*  Yep.
*  Absolutely.
*  It's a complete craziness.
*  And you know, it's an example of, you know, the F-scene story is interesting because it's
*  about villains on both sides of the aisle.
*  Right.
*  This is a classic, it's something I've written about before.
*  The press does not like to do stories where the problem is bipartisan.
*  Right.
*  So when you have an institutional problem, when Democrats and Republicans both share
*  responsibility for it, when, you know, or if it's an institution that kind of exists
*  in perpetuity, no matter what the administration is, we don't really like to do those stories.
*  If Fox likes to do stories about Democrats, MSNBC likes to do stories about Republicans.
*  But the thing that's kind of, you know, all over the place, they don't like to do that
*  story.
*  Epstein is, you know, he sees friends with Trump and with Clinton.
*  I mean, it looks like he has more friends on the Clinton side, but still, and I think
*  This is one of the reasons why this story doesn't have a lot of traction in the media,
*  because neither side really likes the idea of going too deeply on it, feels like to me.
*  Well, it's, but the blatant aspect of it, the only, I mean, the closest that we have
*  to that is the absolute murder, the Jamal Khashoggi murder.
*  That's the closest thing we have to it, was absolute murder.
*  Right.
*  This one, but it's also so insanely blatant, but now you have foreign actors that are involved
*  in it and they all disperse and then this is left with this confusion of who's responsible
*  for it.
*  Well, Saudi Arabia, that's another example where you can't really say it's, you know,
*  one side of the, both parties have been incredibly complicit in their cooperation with the Saudi
*  regime and in, you know, the massacres that are going on in Yemen.
*  This classic example of what Noam Chomsky used to talk about with worthy and unworthy
*  victims, right?
*  Like if the Soviet communists did it, that was bad, but if death squads in El Salvador
*  killed a priest or a Catholic priest, you know, then that was something we didn't write
*  about because they were our client state.
*  Yemen is a story we don't write about.
*  Syria is a story we do write about, but they're really equivalent stories and, you know, but
*  you're absolutely right.
*  The Khashoggi thing, I don't think either party or either side's media really wants
*  to get into that all that deeply.
*  How much is media shifting now?
*  Like, you've obviously been a journalist for a long time, but how much are things changing
*  in the light of the internet?
*  Well, a lot, and this is why, I mean, I have a new book out now that's really about this,
*  right?
*  Why the business has changed.
*  What's it called?
*  Haydnk, yeah, it's out now.
*  And it's really about how the press, the business model of the press has changed.
*  I mean, it's something that you talk about a lot.
*  I hear you on your show all the time talking about how news agencies are always trying
*  to push narratives on people, trying to get people wound up and upset.
*  And that is a conscious business strategy that we didn't have maybe 30 years ago.
*  You know, you think about Walter Cronkite or what the news was like back in the day.
*  You had the whole family sitting around the table and everybody watching, sort of a unifying
*  experience to watch the news.
*  Now you have news for the crazy right-wing uncle and then you have news for the kid in
*  the shade t-shirt and they're different channels and they're trying to wind these people up,
*  you know, to get them upset constantly and stay there.
*  And a lot of that has to do with the internet because before the internet, news companies
*  had like a basically free way of making money.
*  They dominated distribution.
*  The newspaper was the only thing in town that had a, you know, if you wanted to get a wand
*  it had to be through the local newspaper.
*  Now with the internet, the internet is the distribution system.
*  Anybody has access to it, not just the local newspaper.
*  And so the easy money is gone and we have to chase clicks more than we ever had to before.
*  We have to chase eyeballs more than we have to.
*  So we've had to build new money-making strategies and a lot of it has to do with just sort of
*  monetizing anger and division and all these things.
*  We just didn't do that before and it's had a profound difference on the media.
*  As a writer, have you personally experienced this sort of the influence where people have
*  tried to lean you in the direction of clickbait or perhaps maybe alter titles that make them
*  a little bit disingenuous in order to get people excited about the story?
*  My editors at Rolling Stone are pretty good and they give me a lot of leeway to kind of
*  explore whatever I want to explore, but I definitely feel a lot of pressure that I didn't
*  feel before in the business because especially in the Trump era and I've written a lot about
*  the Russia story, right?
*  But that's an example of one size media does has one take on it and another size media
*  has another take on it.
*  And if you are just a journalist and you want to just sort of report the facts, you feel
*  a lot of pressure to fit the facts into a narrative that your audience is going to like.
*  And I had a lot of problem with the Russia story because I thought, I don't like Donald
*  Trump, but I'm like, I don't think this guy's James Bond consorting with Russian spies.
*  I think he's corrupt in other ways.
*  And there was a lot of blowback on my side of the business because people in sort of
*  liberal quote unquote liberal media, you just have, there's a lot of pressure to have everybody
*  fit into a certain narrative.
*  And I think that's really unhealthy for the business.
*  Yeah, very unhealthy, right?
*  Because as soon as people can be manipulated to conform to that narrative, then all sorts
*  of stories can be shifted.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  And you, the job used to be about challenging your audience every now and then, right?
*  Like if you think a certain thing is true, well, it's our job to give you the bad news
*  and say that you're wrong about that.
*  That used to be what the job was to be a journalist.
*  Now it's the opposite.
*  Now we have an audience, we're going to tell you exactly what you want to hear and what
*  you and we're going to reinforce what you think.
*  And that's very unhealthy.
*  A great example of this was in the summer of 2016, I was covering the campaign.
*  I started to hear reporters talking about how they didn't want to report poll numbers
*  that showed the race was close.
*  They thought that that was going to hurt Hillary, right?
*  Like in other words, we had information that the race was close and we're not telling this
*  to audiences because they wanted to hear that it was going to be a blowout for Hillary,
*  right?
*  That didn't help Hillary.
*  It didn't help the Democrats to not warn people about this, right?
*  But it was just because if you turned on MSNBC or CNN and you heard that Trump was within
*  five points or whatever it was, that was going to be a bummer for that audience.
*  So we stayed away from it.
*  This is the kind of thing that it's not politically beneficial to anybody.
*  We're just trying to keep people glued to the set by telling them what they want to
*  hear and that's not the news.
*  That's not our job, you know?
*  And it drives me crazy.
*  Yeah, it should drive you crazy.
*  What you said about journalism being used to be something that you're challenging your
*  reader.
*  You're giving them this reality that may be uncomfortable, but it's educational and expands
*  their view of the world.
*  Where do they get that now?
*  They don't.
*  That's the whole problem.
*  You can predict exactly what each news organization, what their take is going to be on any issue
*  by going...
*  Just to take an example, when the business about the ISIS leader, al-Baghdadi, being
*  killed hit the news, instantaneously you knew that the New York Times, CNN, the Washington
*  Post, that they were going to write a whole bunch of stories about how Trump was overplaying
*  the significance of it, that he was telling lies about it.
*  You knew they were going to make the entire thing about Trump.
*  And then, meanwhile, Fox had a completely different spin on it about how heroic it was.
*  But news audiences didn't have anywhere to go to just simply hear who was this person,
*  why was he important, what do the people in the region think, what is this going to mean
*  going forward?
*  Is it actually going to have any impact?
*  Are we going to have to continually...
*  Is there going to be a new person like this every time?
*  Are we actually accomplishing anything?
*  You don't get that anywhere.
*  All you get is Trump is a shithead on one side and Trump is a hero on the other side.
*  That's not the news.
*  But the thing is, it's like the business aspect of it is so weird.
*  You have your guys like Hannity, where you can absolutely predict what that guy is going
*  to say every single time.
*  You know what side he's on and he's blatant about it.
*  When you see someone like that, you go, okay, well, this is peak bullshit.
*  So where do we go where I see both sides?
*  Where's the middle ground where someone goes, well, this is true, but you got to say this
*  is honest too and this is what's going on over on this side.
*  And the Republicans have a point here.
*  And there's no mainstream media place where you can go for that right now.
*  No, there isn't.
*  And that's...
*  This is one of the things I write about.
*  This is one of the reasons why shows like yours are so popular.
*  I mean, I think there's a complete loss of trust that they feel like people are not being
*  honest with them, right?
*  And they're not being straight.
*  And they come to people like you and a lot of other sort of independent folks who aren't
*  like the quote unquote mainstream media because it's not really thought, it's not reporting,
*  it's not anything.
*  So if you can predict 100% what a person is going to say, that's not thinking, that's
*  not reporting, that's not...
*  It's just marketing.
*  For someone like me, that's so disturbing.
*  I'm a fucking comedian and a cage fighting commentator.
*  When people are coming to me, like this is the source where you go for unbiased representations
*  of what's going on in the world.
*  That's crazy.
*  Well, I mean, let's see.
*  I mean, I started an interview with Barry Weiss, right?
*  And you just, you did a simple base.
*  You didn't go to journalism school, right?
*  No.
*  She said something about how, oh, she's an Assad toady.
*  And you said, what does that mean?
*  You just asked the simple basic questions, right?
*  What does that mean?
*  Where is that coming from?
*  How do you know that?
*  Yeah.
*  Like journalism is a brain surgery.
*  That's all it is.
*  It's just asking the simple questions that sort of pop to mind when you're in a situation
*  like where did this happen?
*  How do we know that?
*  That's true.
*  But there's a whole generation of people in the press now who just simply do not do that,
*  go through the process of just asking simple questions.
*  How do I know that's true?
*  Like after each story report, you're supposed to kind of like wipe your memory clean and
*  start over.
*  So just because somebody was banned the last time you covered them doesn't mean that they're
*  necessarily going to be the bad guy.
*  This time you cover them, right?
*  You have to continually test your assumptions and ask yourself, is this true?
*  Is that true?
*  Is this true?
*  How do we know this?
*  We've just stopped doing that.
*  It's just a morass of like pre-written takes on things.
*  It's really, really bad.
*  You can see why audiences are fleeing from this stuff.
*  They just don't have the impact they used to.
*  It's really interesting that a lot of this is this unpredicted consequence of having
*  these open platforms like Facebook and where people are getting their news and then the
*  algorithm sort of directs them towards things that are going to piss them off, which I don't
*  even think necessarily was initially the plan.
*  I think the plan is to accelerate engagement, right?
*  So they find out what you're engaging with, what stories you're engaging with, and then
*  they give you more of that.
*  Like Ari, my friend Ari Shafir actually tried this out.
*  What he did was he went on YouTube and only looked up puppy videos.
*  That's all he looked at for like weeks.
*  And then YouTube only started recommending puppy videos to him.
*  So it's not necessarily that Facebook wants you to be outraged, but that when you are
*  outraged, whether it's over abortion or war or whatever the subject is, you're going to
*  engage more and their algorithm favors you engaging more.
*  So if you're engaging more about something very positive, if you're all about yoga and
*  meditation, your algorithm would probably favor yoga and meditation because those are
*  the things that you engage with.
*  But it's natural for people to be pissed off and to look for things that are annoying,
*  especially if you're done working and you're like, God, this world sucks.
*  What's going on that sucks worse?
*  And then you go to your Facebook and, oh, Jesus, look at this goddamn border crisis.
*  Oh, Jesus, look at this.
*  Well, fucking here's the problem with these goddamn liberal.
*  They don't know shit.
*  And you engage and then that's your life.
*  And then it's saying, oh, I know how to get Mad Hall fired up.
*  I'm going to fucking send him some abortion stories.
*  Whoa.
*  And then that's your feed.
*  Right.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  But there's so many economic incentives that go in there.
*  They know the more that you engage, the longer that you're on, the more ads that you're going
*  to see.
*  So that same dynamic that Facebook and the social media companies figured out, which
*  is that if you keep feeding somebody something that has been proven to spin that person up
*  and get them wound up, that they're going to come back for more of it and they're going
*  to keep coming back.
*  And actually, you can expand their desire to see that stuff by making them sort of more
*  angry overall.
*  And they will come back and they will spend more and more and more time.
*  Well, the news companies figured out the same thing.
*  They're just funneling stuff at you that they know you're going to just be in an endless
*  cycle of sort of impotent, mute rage all the time.
*  But it's kind of addicting.
*  And they know that.
*  And it's sort of like the tobacco companies.
*  They know it's a product that's bad for you and they just keep giving it to you because
*  it makes money for them.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's just the thing about it is all of it is about ads and how many clicks they get
*  in ads.
*  If they just said, you can have a social media company, but you can't have ads.
*  There's a new federal law.
*  No more ads on Facebook.
*  No more ads on YouTube.
*  No more ads on Twitter.
*  No more ads on Instagram.
*  Good luck.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  But that seems to be what it is.
*  It's like they figured out that your data is worth a tremendous amount of money.
*  And the way they can utilize that money is to sell advertising.
*  Yeah.
*  No, they get it coming and going because they're not only selling you ads, but they're also
*  collecting the information about your habits, which they can then sell again.
*  So it's a dual revenue stream.
*  The media companies, basically they're just consumer businesses where they're trading
*  attention for ad space.
*  So if they can get you to watch four hours of television a day, they have that many ad
*  slots that they can show you and they know how much money they're going to make.
*  But the social media companies get it two ways.
*  They get it by attracting your eyeballs and then also selling your habits to the next
*  set of advertisers, which is very insidious.
*  What's interesting about this is that most people don't think about this as a consumer
*  business.
*  American diseases are very conscious of what they put in their bodies.
*  They won't eat too many candy, well, depending on who they are.
*  But people at least look at what the calories are, but they don't think about the news that
*  way or social media, what they put in their brains.
*  And it's also a consumer product.
*  Yeah, it really is.
*  I've gone over that many times with people that that's a diet.
*  This is your diet.
*  You have a mental diet as well as you have a physical like food diet.
*  Absolutely.
*  You have an information diet and a lot of people are just eating shit with their brain.
*  It's the worst kind of junk food.
*  It's like it's like a cigarette sandwich.
*  It's so fucking bad and it's getting worse.
*  It is.
*  It is getting worse.
*  And it's what's weird is that this is a 10 year old problem and no one saw it coming.
*  And it's kind of overtaken politics.
*  It's overtaking social discourse.
*  Everybody's wrapped up in social media conversations.
*  They carry them on over to the dinner table and it gets people in arguments at work and
*  all this stuff.
*  No one saw coming.
*  These that no one saw the this outrage economy from social media sites, from things like
*  Facebook.
*  No one saw that.
*  No one ever predicted that your data was going to be so valuable.
*  No one the fuck saw that.
*  I don't think anybody.
*  I mean, I think some people in the tech business probably saw early on the potential for this.
*  In terms of other other businesses like the news media and also politics.
*  I mean, you have to think about the impact of this on politics has been enormous.
*  I covered Donald Trump.
*  Trump really was just all about whatever you're pissed off about, I'm right there with you.
*  And people are just sort of pissed off about lots of things these days because they're
*  doing this all day long.
*  And if you can take advantage of that, then you're going to have a lot of success.
*  I think a lot of people haven't figured that out.
*  And some of these things are real causes.
*  Like people are upset about real things.
*  But it's just you're absolutely right.
*  People did not see this coming and they didn't prepare for it.
*  It's just weird that it's one of the biggest sources of income online and people didn't
*  see it coming.
*  I mean, Facebook is generating billions of dollars and now potentially shifting global
*  politics.
*  Yeah, and the whole issue of a couple of companies like Facebook having control over what you
*  do and do not see is an enormous problem that nobody really cares about.
*  I've tried to write about it a few times.
*  I've written a couple of features about it and about how what a serious problem this
*  is.
*  Like if you look at other countries like Israel, China, there are a number of companies where
*  you've seen this pattern of Internet platforms liaising with the government to decide what
*  people can and cannot see.
*  And they'll say, well, we don't want to see, you know, Palestinian protest movements or
*  we don't want to see, you know, the Venezuelan channel, Telesor, like we want to take that
*  off.
*  You think about how that could end up happening in the United States.
*  And it is already a little bit happening.
*  It's a little bit, but it seems to be happening only in the terms of leaning towards the progressive
*  side, which people are OK with because they think especially in the light of Donald Trump
*  being in office, this is acceptable censorship.
*  Yeah, but they're I think they're wrong about that.
*  I think they're wrong about that, too.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's terribly dangerous.
*  It's very short sighted.
*  Yes.
*  And they and I think there's there's also this thing that happens with people where
*  they think, oh, this is never going to happen to me.
*  You know, like you can do that bad thing to this person that I don't like.
*  But as long as it's never going to happen to me.
*  Exactly.
*  History shows it always does happen to you.
*  You know, and that's so we're giving these companies an enormous amount of power to decide
*  all kinds of things.
*  What we what we look at, what what kind of political ideas we can be exposed to.
*  You know, I think it's very, very dangerous.
*  That biased interpretation of what something is.
*  That was what people talked about when the initial Patriot Act was enacted, when people
*  like, hey, this might be fine with Obama in office.
*  Right.
*  Maybe Obama is not going to enact some of the worst clauses of this and use it on people
*  or the was the NDA.
*  So what it was?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Where some of the things were just completely unconstitutional.
*  But don't worry, we're not going to use those.
*  But you're setting these tools aside for whatever fucking president we have.
*  Like what if we have a guy who out trumps Trump?
*  Right.
*  I mean, we never thought we'd have a Trump.
*  Right.
*  What if we have a next level guy post Trump?
*  What if there's some sort of catastrophe, tragedy, attack, something that really gets
*  people fired up and they vote in someone who takes it up to another level?
*  And then he has these tools and then he uses these tools on his political enemies, which
*  is entirely possible.
*  Well, I mean, we've already seen that a little bit.
*  I mean, people don't want to bring this up.
*  But in a lot of the stories that have come out about Trump, they're coming from leaks
*  of classified information that are coming from those war on terror programs that were
*  instituted after 9-11.
*  Yes.
*  The sort of Fideson Amendments Act, the NSA programs to collect data, like they're unmasking
*  people.
*  Like we have a lot of evidence now that there was a lawsuit a couple that came out about
*  a month ago that showed that the FBI was doing something like 60,000 searches a month at
*  one point where they were asking the NSA for the ability to unmask names and that sort
*  of thing.
*  So these tools are incredibly powerful.
*  They're incredibly dangerous.
*  But people thought after 9-11, they were scared.
*  So we want to protect ourselves.
*  So that's okay for now.
*  We'll pull it back later.
*  But you never do pull it back.
*  You know what I mean?
*  It always ends up being used by somebody in the wrong way.
*  And I think we're starting to see that that's going to be a problem.
*  Yeah, I'm real concerned about places like Google and Facebook altering the path of free
*  speech and leaning people in certain directions and silencing people that have opposing viewpoints.
*  And the fact that they think that they're doing this for good because this is how they
*  see the world and they don't understand that you have to let these ideas play out in the
*  marketplace of free speech and free ideas.
*  If you don't do that, if you don't do that, if you don't let people debate the merits,
*  the pros, the cons, what's wrong, what's right, if you don't do that, then you don't get real
*  discourse.
*  If you don't get real discourse, you're essentially, you've got some sort of intellectual dictatorship
*  going on.
*  And because it's a progressive dictatorship, you think it's okay.
*  Because it's people who want everybody to be inclusive.
*  And you know, I mean, this is a weird time for that.
*  It's a really weird time for that.
*  Because as you said, people are so short-sighted.
*  They don't understand that these, like, the First Amendment's in place for a very good
*  reason and set up a long fucking time ago because they did the math.
*  They saw where it was going.
*  And they're like, look, we have to have the ability to express ourselves.
*  We have to have the ability to freely express thoughts and ideas and challenge people that
*  are in a position of power.
*  Because if we don't, we wind up exactly where we came from.
*  Yeah, no.
*  And courts continually reaffirmed that idea that the way to deal with bad speech was with
*  more speech.
*  Yes.
*  And they did it over and over and over again.
*  You know, we, the legal standard for speech, you know, still I think remains that unless
*  it's directly inciting violence, you can, like, you can have speech that incites violence
*  generally and even in the Supreme Court even upheld that.
*  You can have speech that comes from, you know, material that was stolen illegally.
*  That's okay.
*  But we had a very, very high bar for prohibiting speech always.
*  You know, the liable cases, the cases for defamation, you know, that also established
*  a very, very high standard for punishing speech.
*  But now all of a sudden people have a completely different idea about it.
*  It's like, you know, forget about the fact that this was a fundamental concept in American
*  society for, you know, 230 years or whatever, but they just want to change it, you know,
*  without thinking about the consequences.
*  Well, that's where a guy like Trump could be almost like, it's almost like a Trojan
*  horse in a way.
*  Like if you wanted to play 3D chess, what you would do, you'd get a guy who's just
*  so egregious and so outrageous and then so many people oppose him.
*  Get that guy, let him get into a position of power and then sit back, watch the outrage
*  bubble and then take advantage of that and funnel people in the certain directions.
*  I mean, I don't think that's what's happening.
*  But if I was super fucking tinfoil hatty, that's how I would go about it.
*  I would say this is what you want.
*  If you really want to change things for your direction, put someone that opposes it that's
*  disgusting.
*  And that way people just a rational, intelligent person is never going to side with him.
*  So they're going to side with the people that oppose him.
*  And then you could sneak a lot of shit in that maybe they wouldn't agree with in any
*  other circumstance.
*  Trump's election is sort of like another 9-11, right?
*  Like you know, 9-11 happened all of a sudden.
*  People who weren't in favor of the government being able to go through your library records
*  or listen to your phone calls and all of a sudden they were like, oh Jesus, I'm so freaked
*  out.
*  Yeah, fine.
*  When Trump got elected, all of a sudden people suddenly had very different ideas about speech.
*  Like they, you know, hey, that guy's so bad, you know, that maybe we should consider banning
*  X, Y and Z.
*  And yeah, it's, if he was conceived as a way to discredit the First Amendment and some
*  other ideas that would be a brilliant 3D chess move.
*  Yeah, super sneaky.
*  That's like China level, many steps ahead.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  What do you think all this goes?
*  It seems like this is, I mean, obviously you just wrote a book about it, but it seems like
*  this is accelerating.
*  It doesn't seem like anyone's taking a step back and hitting the brakes or opting out.
*  It seems like people are just ramping up the rhetoric.
*  Yeah, I mean, I think the divisiveness problem is going to get worse before it gets better.
*  The business model of the media now is so entrenched that until some of these companies
*  start going out of business because they're doing, you know, they're losing audience because
*  people don't trust them anymore, the news is going to keep doing what it's doing.
*  The Hannity model is going to become normal for news companies.
*  I think it already basically is, you know, on both the left and the right.
*  And in terms of the internet companies, they're consolidating, they're getting more and more
*  power all the time.
*  And I think we've already seen that people have, I think, too much tolerance for letting
*  them make decisions about what we can and cannot see.
*  And I think that's going to get worse before it gets better.
*  I don't know.
*  What do you think?
*  Facebook, Twitter, all these places.
*  Twitter has some of the most ridiculous reasons for banning people.
*  One of them is dead naming.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  So if you call Caitlyn Jenner Bruce, like, hey, I like you better when you're Bruce,
*  banned for life.
*  Right.
*  You can't even say, I like you better when you were Bruce, banned for life.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  And actually, what's really interesting about that is that's a core concept that we've changed
*  completely.
*  All the different ways in the past that we punish speech, we punish the speech, not the
*  person.
*  Yes.
*  Right.
*  So if libel, defamation, all those things, first of all, they were all done through the
*  courts.
*  So you had a way to fight back if you thought you were unjustly accused of having defamed
*  somebody or libeled somebody.
*  But if they found against you, the person who got something out of it was the person
*  who was directly harmed.
*  Right.
*  And the courts judge that.
*  And it wasn't like you were banned for life from ever speaking again.
*  Right.
*  They just gave a bunch of money to a person who might have suffered some kind of career
*  injury or whatever it was because of that.
*  And usually there was a retraction or it was removed from the press or whatever it was.
*  But it wasn't like we were saying, we're never going to allow you to be heard or seen from
*  again.
*  We were sort of encouraging, optimistically, people to get better.
*  Right.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  And we were not doing that at all.
*  Now we're just saying, you know, one strike or two strikes, whatever, you're gone.
*  And it's not like it's a public thing.
*  So you can't sue over it.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, that's what's crazy about it because it is a public utility in a way.
*  Yes, it is.
*  It should be.
*  And even Jack Dorsey from Twitter admitted as much on the podcast and he wishes that
*  we would view it that way.
*  He's actually proposed two versions of Twitter, a Twitter with their standard censorship in
*  place and then a Wild West Twitter.
*  And I'm like, sign me up.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  How do I get on that Wild West Twitter?
*  Because the problem with things like Gab, and I've gone there a few times and watched
*  it, and even Milo Yiannopoulos has criticized it for being this, is that it's just so hate-filled
*  because it's the place where you can go and fucking say anything.
*  So the only people that it's attracting are people that just want to go there and just
*  fucking shoot off cannons of N-bombs and call everybody a kike.
*  It's crazy.
*  And there's real communication there as well.
*  There's plenty of that too.
*  But the sheer number of people that go there just to blow off steam because they can't
*  say those things on Twitter or Facebook or any other social media platform without being
*  banned, because of that, it becomes a channel for it.
*  And it doesn't get a chance.
*  The concept is great.
*  The concept is if you're not doing anything illegal, we're not going to stop.
*  You're not doxing anybody.
*  You're not threatening anybody's life.
*  We're not going to stop you.
*  Go ahead.
*  But if you do that, and you're the only one that does that, unfortunately, everyone who
*  wants to just say fucked up shit just goes right, and you get a disproportionate amount
*  of fucked up shit.
*  And it's directly because of the fact that these places like Twitter or Facebook have
*  censored and they make it so you are scared to say whatever you want to say.
*  And so you can't.
*  So even if you have controversial ideas that maybe some people would agree with and some
*  won't, you can get banned for life for just controversial ideas.
*  Even controversial ideas that are scientifically and biologically factual, like the transgender
*  issue.
*  Like if you say, there's a woman, I brought her up a million times, but Megan Murphy,
*  Murphy, yes.
*  A man is never a woman, she says.
*  They tell her to take it down.
*  She takes a screenshot of it, puts that up, takes it down, but takes a screenshot of the
*  initial tweet.
*  Says, haha, look at that, banned for life.
*  A man is never a woman is a fact.
*  That is a fact.
*  It's a biological fact.
*  Now, if you decide to become a woman and we recognize you as a woman in society, well,
*  that's just common courtesy in my eyes.
*  Like you have a person who has this issue.
*  They feel like they were born in the wrong body.
*  Okay, I get that.
*  I'm cool with that.
*  But to make it so that you're banned forever, you can call someone a dumb fuck, an idiot,
*  a piece of shit.
*  Your mother should have swallowed you.
*  Everybody's like, yeah, terms of service seem fine here.
*  Everything's good.
*  Say a man is never a woman, gone for life.
*  Right.
*  Well, Caitlyn Jenner, I liked you better when you were Bruce.
*  Done.
*  That's it.
*  Yeah.
*  No, and it's crazy.
*  And obviously people see that and they just get madder.
*  And it seems so legitimate.
*  It makes people very, very resentful in ways that they wouldn't be otherwise.
*  And it makes, there's no pathway.
*  There's no other thing.
*  There's no free speech platform that's universally accepted.
*  Like these ones, like I said, like Gab, or there's a couple other ones out there, there's
*  no one's using them.
*  It's a very small percentage of the people in comparison to something like Twitter, which
*  is enormous.
*  Right.
*  And so because people don't want to be kicked off the platform, they're radically changing
*  their behavior.
*  Yes, yes, yes.
*  Self-censoring.
*  And we're seeing this a lot also with political ideas too.
*  Like, you know, I have a podcast, Useful Idiots, it's called, right?
*  We try to talk to people who are kind of excluded from mainstream media because that's happening
*  a lot now, right?
*  If you have the wrong idea about anything, whether it's Russiagate or the Israel-Palestine
*  conflict or Syria or whatever it is, you will suddenly be sort of labeled, I think with
*  Tulsi Gabbard, for instance, they call her an Asadist, right?
*  Like once you get stuck with the term Asadist on Twitter, nobody wants to associate you
*  with you.
*  No one wants to defend you, right?
*  They all kind of, and it's, you're like suddenly like the kid with lice and people don't want
*  that to happen to them.
*  So they stop saying X, Y and Z, right?
*  And they just sort of go with the flow, go with the crowd.
*  And it causes this sort of, you know, uniform conformist discourse that isn't really about
*  anything, right?
*  Because people are just afraid to talk, which is crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, you're not supposed to talk to someone, I experience this all the time, this idea
*  of giving someone a platform.
*  If I have someone on like a Ben Shapiro or something like that, you shouldn't give that
*  guy a platform.
*  Well, he's already got a platform.
*  Wouldn't it be better if I just talked to him and find out what his ideas are and ask
*  him about those ideas?
*  Like we had a very bizarre conversation about gay people, where he's basically full on biblical,
*  religious interpretation of gay people, which to me is always strange.
*  Like okay, how do you stand on shellfish?
*  You know?
*  Just as strong on shrimp?
*  As you are on gay guys?
*  Right, pork.
*  Like why is it gay guys?
*  The Bible's pretty clear on a bunch of different things that don't seem to fire people up the
*  way homosexuality does.
*  Like why?
*  Why do you care?
*  If you had a friend that was eating shrimp, would you go to his house if he had shrimp
*  cocktail?
*  No.
*  But you wouldn't go to a friend's house if he was having a gay marriage.
*  So you won't celebrate gay marriage, but you don't mind a guy who's got a fucking, a shellfish
*  platter out at a party.
*  Like that's in the Bible, man.
*  You're not supposed to wear two different kinds of cloth.
*  You know?
*  There's a bunch of shit in the Bible that you're like, well, God was wrong about that.
*  Like how confident are you?
*  How confident are you that you can interpret God's word so perfectly that you let the lobster
*  slide?
*  But all that butt fucking, we gotta stop that.
*  You know?
*  Like it's really weird.
*  But that's the whole point is you challenge the idea, right?
*  Yes.
*  But the prevailing view now is that even having the discussion, yes, because you have a platform.
*  I mean, I read that thing in the Atlantic, you know, where they're like, you give people
*  to, I forget what the phrase was.
*  They were saying something like, you had-
*  I give people too many chances.
*  Too many chances that people who had already forfeited the right to have them or something
*  along those lines, right?
*  That guy was silly.
*  That guy gave up his hand when he said about me that I'm inexhaustible, but that he likes
*  naps.
*  Right.
*  Oh, it's about you and your naps.
*  That's what it is.
*  You like naps.
*  Okay.
*  So you don't like people that have energy.
*  I'm super sorry.
*  But I thought that piece was really interesting because that whole idea that there are people
*  who have forfeited the right-
*  To communicate forever.
*  To communicate forever.
*  Well, who decides that?
*  I mean, again, there's this intellectual snobism that goes on.
*  Frankly, on my side of the media aisle where, well, let's add what an appropriate thought
*  is.
*  What's right thinking?
*  What's wrong thinking?
*  Who gets to have a platform?
*  Who doesn't get to have a platform?
*  Who we're going to call a monster?
*  Who we're not going to call a-
*  I mean, I just don't understand the arrogance where that comes from to decide that some
*  people- I totally disagree with people like Alex Jones or Shapiro or most things.
*  But I don't think that they should be wiped off the face of the earth.
*  I mean, I don't know.
*  Well, it's interesting to challenge people on these weird ideas and find out how they
*  come to them.
*  And you will get a lot of fence-sitters that will recognize the flaws in their thinking
*  if you let them talk.
*  Because there's a lot of people that are unsure either way.
*  Maybe they haven't invested a lot of time investigating it.
*  Maybe they really don't know what this guy stands for.
*  Maybe they just read a cartoonish version of who he is.
*  And then you get to hear him talk and you go, oh, well, I see the flaw in his thinking
*  or, oh, well, he's right about some things.
*  And a lot of people are right about some things.
*  They're wrong about things and they're right about things.
*  And the only way you can discern that is you communicate with them.
*  But as soon as you de-platform people, like forever, you're just going to make a bunch
*  of angry people.
*  You're just going to make a bunch of people that are completely distrusting.
*  And you're going to absolutely empower the opponents of your ideas.
*  People that do get to- when do they get a chance to have their voice?
*  Well, when they vote.
*  So the more you do this shit, the more you censor conservatives, the more they're going
*  to vote against liberals.
*  This is just a fact.
*  There's no getting around that.
*  This is human nature.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I lived in the former Soviet Union for 11 years.
*  And 100 percent, if you lived in Soviet Russia and something was published by an official
*  publisher, people thought it was basically full of shit.
*  But if it was in the samizdat, if it was in the privately circled stuff that had been
*  repressed and censored, people thought that was the coolest thing in the world.
*  That was the hot ticket.
*  And you're automatically giving something cachet and added weight by censoring it.
*  I mean, this is just the way it works.
*  It's human nature.
*  If people think that you don't want them to see something, they're going to run to it
*  twice as hard.
*  So I just don't understand a lot of that instinct.
*  I think people have this idea that it works, that deplatforming works, but you can't deplatform
*  an idea.
*  You may be able to do it to a person or two, but eventually you have to confront the idea.
*  You can do it to a few people, and it has been successful, which is one of the reasons
*  why people are so emboldened.
*  They have a successfully deplatformed Milo.
*  I mean, they really have.
*  It's very hard to hear him talk anymore.
*  He's not in the public conversation the way he used to be because they kicked him off
*  of all these different platforms.
*  And if you go into why they kicked him off these different platforms, even if you don't
*  agree with him, and I don't on a lot of things, like, boy, I don't agree with kicking him
*  off those platforms.
*  If you listen to what he got kicked off for, it's like, man, I don't know.
*  This doesn't seem like this makes a lot of sense.
*  Yeah, no, I mean, same thing with Alex Jones.
*  Alex Jones has said, he's gone after me a couple of times in ways that were pretty funny,
*  actually.
*  But when he was kicked off all these platforms, I wrote a piece saying I think people are
*  kind of doing an end zone dance a little early on this one because Jones is a classic example
*  of how the system, the way the system used to work, they would have punished him for
*  being libelous about this Andy Hook thing, right?
*  Because that would sort of fit the classic definition of what prohibited speech was before.
*  But he would have lost probably a lot, and he still might in those court cases.
*  But to remove him forever, I think it creates a new way of dealing with speech that I think
*  is very dangerous.
*  Right, because the goalposts keep getting moved.
*  If you can ban him for that, then why don't you ban me for repeating the things that I
*  said about Meghan Murphy?
*  Or ban, because what I said about Bruce Jenner, ban this for that.
*  You get further and further down the line, you keep moving these goalposts, the next
*  thing you know, you're in a very rigid, tightly controlled area where you can communicate,
*  and you're suppressed.
*  And that just accelerates your desire to step out of that boundary.
*  And it makes you want to say things that maybe you wouldn't even have thought of before.
*  And also, logistically, it's an incredibly, it's an insane thing to even think about asking
*  platforms to rationally go through all this content.
*  I talked to somebody who was a pretty high ranking Facebook executive after the Alex Jones
*  thing.
*  And he said, think about what we used to do just to keep porn off Facebook.
*  And we're dealing with what, a couple of billion items of content every single day.
*  We had these really high tech algorithms that we designed to look for flesh tones.
*  That's how the Vietnamese running girl photo got taken off Facebook because they automatically
*  spotted a naked girl.
*  And they took that down.
*  He's like, the Facebook algo doesn't know that's an icon of fucking journalism, right?
*  It just knows it's a naked girl.
*  So you say you take that and now you're going to ask Facebook to make decisions about ideas,
*  right?
*  If it's that hard and that expensive for us to go through and just to keep child porn
*  off of Facebook, think about how crazy it's going to be when we start having entry level
*  people deciding what is and is not appropriate political content.
*  It's not only going to be impossible to enforce, they're going to make a mess of it and they
*  will and they already are.
*  And I think that's what we're seeing.
*  Well, that's why Twitter is so weird because you can get away with shit on Facebook.
*  You can say things on Facebook.
*  Facebook doesn't have a policy about dead naming or Facebook doesn't have a policy about
*  misgendering people, but they do have a porn policy.
*  Well, now Twitter, you can have porn.
*  I have to be very careful when I give my phone to my kids.
*  Make sure they don't open up the fucking Twitter app because I follow a lot of dirty girls.
*  And some of them, I mean, it's just right there.
*  There's no warning, bang, right in your face.
*  I mean, it's kind of crazy.
*  They have such an open policy when it comes to sex, which I'm happy they do.
*  I'm happy, not even that I want to see porn, but I'm happy that their attitude is just
*  fine.
*  It's legal.
*  Do it.
*  You don't have to follow those people if you don't like.
*  It seems like it's in the American spirit to be, I don't know.
*  Yes, that's what it all comes down to for me.
*  But yeah, no, the policies are completely inconsistent too with Twitter.
*  I've talked to people who've been removed from Twitter for saying pretty borderline
*  things.
*  Basically, pretty mild insults or something that would be threatening only if you really
*  squinted hard.
*  There was a guy from the Ron Paul Institute who got taken down, for instance, because
*  he was having a fight with some guy who was, I think, a Clinton fan.
*  I forget what it was exactly.
*  But you'll see behavior that's much worse from people of another political ilk and
*  they will not be removed.
*  Or they might be a smaller profile person, they won't be removed.
*  So then what is that all about?
*  If it's only a person who has 20,000 followers or higher, it's just so, you just can't do
*  it.
*  There are just too many layers.
*  Anyway, I'm against it just generally, but just in terms of the logistics, it doesn't
*  make any sense.
*  I'm against it generally too.
*  When I talked to Jack and he was explaining to me the problems with trying to manage things
*  at scale, you really kind of get a sense of it.
*  Like, oh, you guys are dealing with billions and billions of humans using these things.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  But they're already, in many countries around the world, they have armies of thousands of
*  people who go through content to try to flag this or that kind of political content.
*  Yeah, and punish people.
*  Yeah.
*  Germany has, oh God, I forget what the term was.
*  They have some really scary sort of authoritarian word for like filtration centers or something
*  like that.
*  The Chinese have armies of people.
*  I did a story about Facebook and how it was teaming up with groups like the Atlantic Council
*  here in the United States.
*  I remember a couple of years ago, the Senate called in Twitter, Facebook, and Google to
*  Washington and asked them to devise strategies for preventing the sowing of discord.
*  You know, so basically it was asking them to come up with strategies for filtering out
*  fake news and then also certain kinds of offensive content.
*  But that is a stepping stone to what we've seen in other countries, I think.
*  And I think it's really worrisome, but nobody seems to care on our side of the aisle, which
*  is very strange.
*  Well, it's my side of the aisle as well.
*  It's a censorship issue.
*  You know, and it's a short-sighted thing, as you said before.
*  And it's not even.
*  There's people that do pretty egregious things from the left, like the Covington school thing,
*  when people were saying, we've got to dox these kids and give me their names, release
*  their names.
*  These people are still on Twitter to this day.
*  Right.
*  You're talking about kids that just happen to have these make America great again hats.
*  And I have a friend who used to live in that area said, like, no, you don't get it.
*  Like, there's these stands.
*  These kids are on a high school, like, field trip.
*  There's these stands.
*  We could buy these hats everywhere.
*  These kids bought the hats there.
*  They think they're being funny.
*  These guys play the music and then get in their face.
*  You take a photo of it.
*  It looks like this guy standing in this Native American guy's face.
*  But then you see the whole video.
*  And so, no, no, no, the Native American guy was playing his drum, walking towards him.
*  And then everybody starts piling in.
*  Yeah, everybody just loses their minds.
*  It's an outrage cycle.
*  It's just so exhausting.
*  And signaling.
*  Everyone's signaling how virtuous they are.
*  Everyone's signaling that they're on the right side.
*  Everyone's signaling, you know, I want names.
*  Take these guys down.
*  Like, you're talking about 16-year-old kids.
*  Right.
*  It's so fucking crazy.
*  And what is he, he's guilty of smiling?
*  Is that what he's guilty of?
*  Yeah, no, he's got a MAGA hat on.
*  I mean, yeah, it's crazy.
*  And the signaling thing is crazy.
*  And for me, in the news business, a lot of people that I know went into journalism precisely
*  because we didn't want to talk about our political views.
*  The whole point of the job is like, you know, we're just going to tell you what the facts
*  are.
*  Like, I'm not going to tell you what I'm all about.
*  You can't do that anymore.
*  Everything's editorialized.
*  Everything is about editorializing and signaling.
*  It's just like what you're saying.
*  You're telling people what your stance is on things.
*  And that's the opposite of what the job used to be.
*  And this is, again, one of the things I've been trying to focus on is that, you know,
*  what's exactly what you're talking about.
*  People used to go to the news because they wanted to find out what happened in the world
*  and they can't do it anymore because everything that you turn on, every kind of content is
*  just editorialized content where people are sort of telling you where they stand on things.
*  And you know, I don't want to know that.
*  I want to know what the information is.
*  Yeah, it's so hard.
*  How does this get resolved?
*  Because we're dealing with essentially a two decade old problem, right?
*  I mean, give or take.
*  Before that, before the social media and before the internet and websites, this just wasn't
*  what it was.
*  You could count on the New York Times to give you an unbiased version of what's going on
*  in the world.
*  I don't necessarily know that's true anymore.
*  No, no.
*  The Times has kind of gone over to this model as well.
*  They're super woke.
*  They've struggled with it.
*  There was an editorial and I wrote about this in the book that in the summer of 2016, this
*  guy Jim Rutenberg wrote this piece that said Trump is testing the norms of objectivity.
*  That was the name of the piece.
*  And basically what he said is Trump is so bad that we have to rethink what objectivity
*  means.
*  We have to not only be true, but true to history's judgment, he said.
*  And we have to have copious coverage and aggressive coverage.
*  So we're going to cover Trump a lot.
*  We're going to cover him aggressively and we're going to show you we're going to take
*  a stand on this issue rather than just tell you what happened.
*  So rather than doing the traditional New York Times thing of just the facts, we'll tell
*  you you sorted out.
*  You figure it out.
*  We're going to tell you what your stance should be.
*  And where do we go from here?
*  How does it get resolved?
*  I don't know.
*  You know, unless the financial incentives change, they're not going to change.
*  You know, the business used to be back when you're talking about with the New York Times
*  and then there were three networks and they were all trying to get the whole audience.
*  Right.
*  So they were doing that kind of neutral fact-finding mission and it was working for them financially.
*  Now they can't do that because of the Internet.
*  You're hunting for audience in little groups.
*  Yeah.
*  And they're just giving you hyper politicized stuff because that's the only way they can
*  make money.
*  I don't know how we change it.
*  I don't know how we go, you know, we reverse it.
*  It's a problem.
*  It's so interesting, though, because I mean, if you looked at human interactions and if
*  you looked at, you know, dispensing news and information and you followed trends from like
*  the 30s to the 40s to the 50s to the 60s to 70s, he'd be like, oh, well, people are getting
*  better at this.
*  People getting better.
*  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
*  What the fuck is going on now?
*  Everything's off the rails.
*  Yeah.
*  There's two camps barking at each other.
*  There's blatant misinformation on both sides, blatant distortions of the truth, blatant
*  editorializing of facts.
*  And you're like, well, hey, what happened, guys?
*  Yeah, no, it's crazy.
*  And not that the news didn't have distortions before.
*  Like you think about, you know, we covered up all sorts of things, you know, massacres
*  in Cambodia, secret bombing, you know, use of Agent Orange, like stuff like that just
*  didn't appear in the news in the degree it should.
*  Now, though, you turn on either MSNBC or Fox and you're right, you'll find something that's
*  just totally full of shit within five minutes, usually.
*  And that did not used to be the case.
*  You know, I think individual reporters used to take a lot of pride in their work, you
*  know, and it's different now.
*  And now when you make mistakes in the business, you don't get bounced out of the business
*  in the way you used to.
*  And that's really strange.
*  Only plagiarism, right?
*  Plagiarism still bounces you.
*  Plagiarism is pretty, yeah, that's usually fatal, right?
*  You're not going to usually recover from that.
*  I mean, some people have kind of near problems with that and they, you know, I'm not going
*  to name names.
*  But no, but you think about people who got stories like the WMD thing wrong.
*  Not only do they not get bounced out of the business, they all got promoted.
*  You know, they're like editors of major magazines now.
*  And so what does that tell people in the business?
*  Well, it tells you, you know, if you screw up, as long as you screw up with a whole bunch
*  of other people, it's okay, you know, which is not good.
*  And we used to have a lot of pride about that stuff in this business and now we don't anymore.
*  You know, there isn't the shame connected with screwing something up that there used to be.
*  I think there's a real danger with, in terms of social media especially, in not complying
*  to the Constitution, not complying to the First Amendment.
*  I think there's a real danger in that.
*  And I don't think we recognize that danger because I don't think we saw what social media
*  was until it was too late.
*  And then by the time it was too late, we had already had these sort of standards in place
*  and the people that run it were already getting away with enforcing their own personal bias,
*  their ideological bias.
*  And this is, when you're at this position where you go, well, how does that ever get
*  resolved?
*  They're not going to resolve it on their own.
*  They're still making assloads of money.
*  What do you do?
*  Does the government resolve it?
*  Well, if Trump steps in and resolves it, it looks like he's trying to resolve it to save
*  his own political career or to, you know, to help his supporters.
*  Yeah, no, and no matter what, if Trump does anything about it, automatically everyone's
*  going to be against it.
*  Right.
*  Right?
*  You know, even if it's, even if there's some sense in there somewhere, people won't get
*  behind it.
*  But no.
*  And if they do anything about it, there's going to be a correction time.
*  There's going to be a gab time where it's going to be like that, where it's just going
*  to flood with people that are just like, with this newfound freedom, they're just going to
*  go, just shoot up the town, you know?
*  But I mean, but how would you, how would you fix it now?
*  That's the thing, because it's not only about rules, it's also about culture.
*  Like people have already, they're in this pattern of, you know, not saying the wrong
*  thing.
*  Right.
*  And they don't, I think there's, we're in a culture that doesn't even really know how
*  to deal with free speech if we actually had it in the same way we used to, you know?
*  No one seems to have a forecast.
*  Like no one's like, well, the storm is going to last about four years.
*  And then it's like, there's no, there's no forecast.
*  No.
*  Everyone's like, wow, those fucking uncharted waters.
*  Right, right.
*  But if you, historically, the tendency is once you have a tool that kind of can be used
*  to keep people in line and enforce compliance of ideas, then it always ends up worsening
*  and becoming more and more dictatorial and authoritarian.
*  I mean, again, you go back to the Soviet example, like once they started, you know, really exercising
*  a lot of control over the press and literature and things like that, it didn't get better.
*  You know, it just continued becoming more of a, you know, an entrenched thing until,
*  so that's what I worry about.
*  I think we're headed more in that direction.
*  Yeah, I think so too.
*  I'm not really, I'm just really concerned with, on both sides, when people dig their
*  heels in ideologically, the other side just gets even more convinced they're correct.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And there's no cross dialogue of any kind.
*  No.
*  Anymore.
*  And even now, I mean, it's interesting.
*  You had Bernie Sanders on your show, and Sanders is one of the few politicians left who has
*  this idea that we should talk to everybody.
*  Like there are no illegitimate audiences out there.
*  And like, you know, that's my job as a politician is to try to convince you of things.
*  But that's not normal in the Democratic Party anymore.
*  Elizabeth Warren, you know, has made a big thing about not going on Fox and about having
*  certain people taken off Twitter.
*  And I think that's increasingly the sort of line of thought in mainstream Democratic Party
*  thought now is that we're just going to rule out whatever that is, 47% of the electorate,
*  we're just not going to talk to them anymore.
*  Right, right.
*  I don't know how that can possibly be a successful political strategy.
*  And what the point is, you know?
*  Yeah.
*  No, it doesn't make any sense.
*  I was reading something where people are going after Tulsi Gabbard for being on Tucker Carlson.
*  She's like, I'll talk to everybody.
*  And I'm glad she does.
*  And by the way, it's like, it's hard for her because she's kind of an outside candidate.
*  It's hard for her to get time on these other networks.
*  And so they want to punish her for being on Tucker Carlson's.
*  And then they have this, you know, reductionist view of who he is.
*  He's a white supremacist.
*  Like, oh, well, she supports white supremacists.
*  She goes on a white supremacist show.
*  Okay, is that what he is?
*  Is that really what he is?
*  And isn't it a lot more than that?
*  There's a lot going on there.
*  You guys are fucking with life.
*  You're fucking with the reality of life.
*  And you're saying it in these sentences.
*  You're printing it out in these paragraphs as fact.
*  And you're sending it out there irresponsibly.
*  It's just really strange that people don't understand the repercussions of that.
*  Yeah, that's something we talk about on our podcast, The Useful Idiots, all the time,
*  is that it's a catch-22, right?
*  You don't invite somebody like Tulsi Gabbard on to CNN, MSNBC.
*  They're kind of excluded from the same platforms the other politicians get.
*  So they go to other platforms, right?
*  And then you say, oh, you went on that platform, so you're illegitimate.
*  You know, what do you want them to do?
*  They do the same thing with people who go on RT, for instance, right?
*  Oh, well, you're helping the Russians because you went on RT.
*  Well, that's because you didn't invite them on any...
*  I mean, people are going to try to talk to anybody they can to spread their ideas.
*  And that kind of propaganda thing is pretty constant now.
*  In the use of the term, terms like white supremacist with Tucker Carlson,
*  I mean, there are a million terms now that you use to just kind of throw at people.
*  And what they're trying to do is create this ick factor around people, right?
*  Once someone gets a label associated with them,
*  then nobody wants to be associated with that person, right?
*  And then they quickly kind of die out of the public scene.
*  And I think that's really bad too.
*  You know, it's just an anti-intellectual way of dealing with things.
*  And I think it's not good.
*  It's weird that it's so prevalent.
*  It's weird that there's so few proponents of a more open-minded way of thinking.
*  Right, yeah.
*  And just to take the gap, we had Tulsi Gavin on our show too.
*  And immediately we got accused.
*  What, do you love Assad?
*  Right?
*  Do you want to bomb Syria?
*  And do you want to murder Syrian children?
*  No, you know, she's a presidential candidate.
*  And we want to talk to her and hear what she has to say.
*  But they immediately go to the maximalist interpretation of everything.
*  And then what they're basically saying when they ask you those questions are,
*  do you want to wear that label too?
*  Because she's got it already.
*  So if you have her on again, you're going to have that label.
*  And people, they see that.
*  Sure.
*  And so people who don't have a big following and who are worried about their
*  careers and about the money and advertisers and stuff like that,
*  they think twice about interviewing that person the next time.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  And that's another way to get at speech.
*  Exactly.
*  And again, I don't know how you get out of it.
*  You know?
*  And I mean, I've experienced some blowback, I guess.
*  But it hasn't worked yet.
*  Right.
*  You know what I mean?
*  It's not real.
*  It's just words.
*  Like, OK.
*  Well, but yeah.
*  But you're handling it the right way, Ben.
*  I think your audience is rewarding you for not bowing to it.
*  You know?
*  And I think that more people, if they took that example and said,
*  I'm not going to listen to what the PAC says about this,
*  I'm not going to be afraid of being called a name, fuck that.
*  I'm going to talk to who I want to talk to.
*  And I'm going to explore whatever ideas I want to explore.
*  Then this kind of stuff wouldn't be as effective.
*  So yeah.
*  It's so easy to do to people.
*  And it's so easy for them to deplatform people.
*  Yeah.
*  And shadow banning and all this other weird shit that's going on.
*  Yeah.
*  Channeling people and pushing people
*  into these areas of their platforms
*  that makes them less accessible.
*  And I know where it comes from.
*  I was young and politically active once.
*  You want to change the world.
*  You want to make it a better place.
*  So you're in college.
*  And you don't have any power.
*  You don't have any way to make something into legislation.
*  You know what I mean?
*  So what do you do?
*  Social media gives you the illusion
*  that you're having an impact in the world
*  by maybe getting somebody deplatformed or taken off
*  Twitter or something like that.
*  It feels like it's political action to people.
*  But it's not.
*  You know what I mean?
*  It's something that is open to people to do.
*  But it's not the same as getting 60 members of the Senate
*  to raise taxes on a corporation that's
*  been evading them for 20 years.
*  You know what I mean?
*  That's real action.
*  This, getting some random person taken off the internet
*  is just not change.
*  But people feel like it is.
*  And they want to do the right thing.
*  So I get it.
*  But no, it's not real political action, I don't think.
*  No, it's fucking gross.
*  And there's so much of it.
*  There's so little logic.
*  Also, and this must be a personal thing for you,
*  but isn't this the unfunniest time in American history?
*  Yes and no, because you're rewarded
*  for stepping outside of the box in a big way.
*  Like, yeah, you mean Dave Chappelle gets attacked.
*  But guess what?
*  He also gets rewarded in a huge way.
*  He goes on stage now, people go ape shit.
*  And part of the reason why they go fucking bonkers
*  is because they know that this guy doesn't give a fuck.
*  And he's one of the rare ones who doesn't give a fuck.
*  So when he goes up there, you know,
*  if he thinks something crazy about whatever it is,
*  whatever protected group or whatever idea
*  that he's not supposed to explore,
*  that's not going to stop him at all.
*  He's going to tell you exactly what
*  he thinks about those things, regardless of all
*  this woke blowback.
*  He doesn't care.
*  And so because of that, he's rewarded even more.
*  And same thing with Bill Burr.
*  Same thing with a lot of comics.
*  I experienced it with my own jokes.
*  More controversial bits get people more fired up now.
*  They love it.
*  Because everyone's smothered.
*  They're smothered by human resources
*  and smothered by office politics.
*  And you're smothered by social discourse restrictions.
*  And you just don't feel like you can express yourself anymore.
*  That's true.
*  And a lot of people also don't have a,
*  they feel like they're being watched all the time.
*  Yes.
*  Because of other things.
*  Sure.
*  And they feel like they kind of can't let it all hang out
*  anywhere.
*  Yeah.
*  Right?
*  And so that's, yeah, they do feel incredibly repressed
*  and under the gun.
*  Yeah.
*  I think that that's true.
*  Yeah.
*  I just, I feel like, I mean, I'm not a comic,
*  but I just imagine it must be a more challenging environment.
*  It's more challenging, but more rewarding, too.
*  My friend Ari said it best.
*  He said, this is a great time for comedy,
*  because comedy is dangerous again.
*  Right.
*  That's true.
*  Yeah.
*  That's true.
*  Yeah.
*  It kind of goes back to like the Lenny Bruce era, right?
*  Yeah.
*  When you could kind of completely freak people out
*  with saying a couple of things.
*  Sure.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  For good or bad.
*  For prior, yeah.
*  Well, you saw it with like Louis CK, right?
*  Louis CK is under the microscope now.
*  That joke that he made about Parkland
*  is absolutely a Louis CK joke.
*  If you followed him throughout his career.
*  What was the joke again?
*  I'm sorry.
*  The joke was, why am I listening to these Parkland survivors?
*  Why are you interesting?
*  Because you push some fat kid in the way.
*  Like, see, you're laughing.
*  Right.
*  Like, that is a Louis CK joke.
*  He's saying something fucked up that you're not supposed to say.
*  Throughout his goddamn career, he's done that.
*  That's what he's always done.
*  But after the jerking off in front of women and all that stuff,
*  and him coming out and admitting it and then taking a bunch of time
*  off, now he's a target.
*  So now he does something like that.
*  And they're like, oh, he's all right now.
*  Like, no, this is what he's always done.
*  He's always taking this sort of contrarian outside the box,
*  fucked up, but hilarious take on things.
*  And that bit, unfortunately, because it was released by someone
*  who made a YouTube video of it, he didn't get a chance to.
*  He was gone for 10 months.
*  And he had only done a couple sets when he was flushing these ideas out.
*  I guarantee you he would have turned that idea into a brilliant bit.
*  But he never got the chance.
*  Because it was just set out there in the wild when it was a baby.
*  And it was mauled down by wolves.
*  It needed to be, it needed to grow.
*  Yeah.
*  These bits, they grow and they develop.
*  And that was a controversial idea that we're
*  supposed to think that someone's interesting just
*  because they survived a tragedy.
*  And his take is like, no, no, no, no, you're not interesting.
*  You're fucking boring.
*  You're annoying.
*  Get off my TV.
*  And a lot of us have felt that way.
*  Sure.
*  The way he said it was easy to take and put it out of context,
*  put it in quotes, and turn him into an asshole.
*  Yeah, but that's what comedy is, right?
*  It's taking what people, the thoughts that everybody has,
*  and vocalizing that thing, that forbidden thing,
*  in a way that people can kind of come together over.
*  I mean, I think that was a lot of what Richard Pryor's humor
*  was about.
*  He took a lot of the sort of uncomfortable race problems,
*  and he just kind of put them out there.
*  And both white people and black people laughed at it, together.
*  And that was what was good about it.
*  But if you can't, if people are afraid to vocalize those things,
*  that they think it's going to ruin their career.
*  I mean, I guess that makes it more interesting, right?
*  It does.
*  It's more high stakes.
*  But if you can navigate those waters
*  and get to the promised land of the punchline,
*  it's even more rewarding.
*  But you just have to explain yourself better.
*  You have to have better points.
*  You have to have a better structure to your material,
*  where while the people who may find your idea objectionable,
*  they, you coax them.
*  Like, hold my hand.
*  I'm going to take you through the woods.
*  We're going to be OK.
*  Follow me.
*  And boom!
*  Isn't that funny?
*  Right, right, right.
*  But you have to navigate it skillfully.
*  And you have to navigate it thoughtfully.
*  And you have to really have a point.
*  You can't have a half-assed point.
*  But you can have a situation where
*  it's fatal to be off by a little bit.
*  There was a writer that I loved growing up,
*  a Soviet writer named Isaac Babel.
*  Stalin ended up shooting him.
*  But he gave a speech about, I think it was in 1936,
*  to a Soviet writers collective.
*  And he said, people say that we don't have as much freedom
*  as we used to.
*  But actually, all that the Communist Party has done
*  has prevented us from writing badly.
*  The only thing that's outlawed now is writing badly.
*  And everybody laughed.
*  But he was actually saying something pretty serious,
*  which is that you can't write well unless you can screw up,
*  too.
*  On the way to being creative in a good way, you have to miss.
*  And if missing is not allowed and there's
*  high punishment for missing, you're not going to get art.
*  You're not going to get revelation.
*  You're not going to get all these things.
*  In comedy, it's particularly important
*  because you have to work it out in front of people.
*  Absolutely.
*  Yeah, no, I used to sit at a comedy club in Manhattan
*  when I was in college.
*  They would try out their material on a Wednesday,
*  early.
*  And that was always the most interesting time for me.
*  Like, they're trying stuff out.
*  And a lot of it wasn't so good.
*  But it was interesting.
*  And you just can't have a situation
*  where people feel like one wrong word is
*  going to ruin their career.
*  But there's also people that are wolves.
*  And they're trying to take out that little baby joke
*  wandering through the woods.
*  They want that feeling of being able to take someone down.
*  And you're getting that now, too, which is just.
*  And so now because of that, there's yonder bags.
*  The improv where I'm performing tonight,
*  they use yonder bags.
*  You have to put yourself on a bag when you go in there
*  so you can't record things.
*  Yonder bags.
*  Yes, it's a company called Yonder.
*  It's just so strange.
*  All the shows I did with Chappelle, he uses yonder bags.
*  And the idea is to prevent people from.
*  From filming and recording and then eventually putting
*  your stuff out there.
*  Well, I'm kind of all for that.
*  I mean, I've seen this with politicians on the campaign
*  trail.
*  They are so tight now in ways that they used to not be.
*  We saw the Donald Trump thing.
*  Donald Trump Jr., where Trump Jr., they didn't want him to do.
*  They wanted him to do a Q&A. And he didn't want to do it.
*  They booed him.
*  The right wing people were booing him.
*  They were yelling out, Q&A, Q&A.
*  Because they wanted to be able to talk.
*  Oh, I see.
*  They wanted to be able to say something to him.
*  And these were people that were like far right.
*  Far right people.
*  They just didn't think he was being right enough
*  or he was playing the game wrong or he wasn't letting
*  them complain to him.
*  Right, right.
*  Yeah, no, that's bad.
*  And politicians are aware of that now.
*  And they're constantly aware that they're on film everywhere.
*  And so they're 1,000% less interesting because they're
*  I mean, I remember covering the campaign in 2004.
*  And I saw Dennis Kucinich give a speech somewhere.
*  And he was going from, I think, Maine to New Hampshire.
*  And I said, can I get a ride back to New Hampshire?
*  He's like, yeah, sure.
*  So he takes me on the van.
*  He takes his shoes off.
*  He's cracking jokes and everything
*  and eating udon noodles or something.
*  Political candidates would not do that now.
*  They'd be afraid to be off the record with you.
*  Right, right, right.
*  And they're afraid to be around people
*  and just behave like people, which is not good, I don't think.
*  It's the weirdest time ever to be a politician
*  because it's basically you've got this one guy who
*  made it through being hugely flawed and just going,
*  ah, fucking locker room talk.
*  And everyone's like, well, yeah, it is locker room talk, I guess.
*  And then it works.
*  And he gets through and he wins.
*  And so you've got him who seems like he's so greasy,
*  like nothing sticks to him.
*  And then you have everyone else who's
*  terrified of any slight misstep.
*  Yeah, totally.
*  And you can't replicate the way Trump does this.
*  You know, Trump is, he was born this way.
*  There's like a thing going on in his head.
*  He is pathologically driven to behave in a certain way.
*  And he's not going to be cowed by the way people are
*  of a social media because he just doesn't think that way.
*  But no one else is going to behave like that.
*  What do you think about him and speed?
*  What do you think about all that?
*  Does he take speed, you mean?
*  Yeah.
*  So did you ever see his speech after Super Tuesday?
*  Yeah, that's the one where he was slurry.
*  That was the one where he was ramped up.
*  I just say, watch that speech.
*  We're not supposed to draw conclusions,
*  but what might be going on pharmaceutically with somebody.
*  But I would say just watch Donald Trump's performance
*  after the results of the Super Tuesday roll in in 2016.
*  Let's hear some of that.
*  First of all, the Christie is hilarious.
*  Watch Hillary's speech, and she's talking about,
*  wages have been poor, and everything's poor,
*  and everything's doing badly.
*  But we're going to make it.
*  She's been there for so long.
*  I mean, if she hasn't straightened it out by now,
*  she's not going to straighten it out in the next four years.
*  It's just going to become worse and worse.
*  She wants to make America whole again.
*  And I'm trying to figure out what is that all about.
*  Yeah, I mean, I have to go back and look.
*  But yeah, but he went on and on.
*  Also, the Christie factor was really funny with that,
*  because he was the huge.
*  He's just sitting back there going, what am I doing?
*  What am I doing with my life?
*  Look at his face.
*  Literally, you could see his brain wander.
*  Well, how the fuck did this happen?
*  I was going to be the man.
*  I was the goddamn president.
*  It was going to happen for me.
*  I could see it happening.
*  I saw him in Ames, Iowa, basically
*  standing alone in a park waiting for people
*  to try to shake his hand.
*  Yeah, it was pretty bad.
*  Like, you see that.
*  But do you have a theory about Trump and speed?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, I think he's on some stuff.
*  I think, first of all, I know so many journalists
*  that are on speed.
*  I know so many people that are on Adderall.
*  And it's very effective.
*  It gives you confidence.
*  It gives you a delusional perspective.
*  You get a delusional state of confidence.
*  It makes people think they can do anything.
*  It's basically a low-level meth.
*  It's very similar to methamphetamine chemically.
*  Sure.
*  And people are on it.
*  Tell me what it's like, because I haven't done it.
*  Yeah, I mean, I've done speed, too.
*  I mean, all those drugs are like baby speed, basically.
*  And you're absolutely right.
*  I think people who, it's not good for a writer,
*  because writing is one of these things where
*  one of the most important things is being able to step back
*  and ask, am I really, am I full of shit here?
*  Are my jokes as funny as I think they are?
*  Once that mechanism starts to go wrong,
*  you're really lost as a writer, right?
*  Because you're not in front of an audience.
*  You're with yourself in front of a computer.
*  So I don't think speed is a great drug.
*  I mean, you get a lot of stuff done.
*  So that's good.
*  But yeah, no, I think there's a lot of people
*  who are on it now.
*  And also a lot of it's because kids come up through school
*  and they're on it, too.
*  And they get used to it.
*  So I have kids.
*  I wouldn't dream of giving them any of those drugs.
*  I think it's crazy.
*  I do, too.
*  I'm sure you saw the Sudafed picture, too, right?
*  No, what was that?
*  Trump was sitting in his office eating a,
*  that famous photo where he's like,
*  I love Hispanics, where he's eating a taco bowl at Trump
*  Tower.
*  And behind him, there's an open drawer.
*  And that open drawer is boxes of Sudafed.
*  And Sudafed gives you a low level buzz.
*  And this is why you used to have to go to CVS to buy this stuff.
*  You used to have to give your drivers, I guess you still do.
*  You have to give your driver's license,
*  because they want to make sure you're not cooking meth.
*  You're buying like 10 boxes of it at a time
*  and cooking up a batch.
*  Yeah, if you're like in a hauler in Kentucky
*  and you go in and get 20 boxes of Sudafed,
*  I think pretty much people know what you're doing there.
*  That's really funny.
*  So he had a bunch of Sudafed behind him?
*  Yeah, in his box.
*  And there was that one reporter that, what was that guy's name
*  again, who had a whole, he wrote a series of tweets,
*  which he eventually wound up taking down, by the way, Jamie.
*  I can't find those fucking tweets.
*  He wrote a series of tweets that there
*  was a very specific Dwayne Reed Pharmacy where
*  Trump got amphetamines for something that was,
*  in quotes, called metabolic disorder, Kurt Eichenwald.
*  Fun fact.
*  Oh, Kurt, yeah.
*  1982, Trump started taking amphetamine derivatives,
*  abused them, only supposed to take two for 25 days,
*  stayed on for eight years.
*  Really.
*  Now, is he full shit?
*  So yeah, Kurt Eichenwald is interesting,
*  because he's written some really good books about finance.
*  He wrote a book about Enron.
*  He wrote a book about Prudential.
*  It was really good.
*  And when I was starting out writing about Wall Street,
*  I was like, wow, these books are really incredibly well
*  researched.
*  But he had some stuff in 2016 where,
*  that's an example of something, as a reporter, I see that.
*  I'm like, well, where's that coming from?
*  Because in journalism, you can't really
*  accuse somebody of certain things
*  unless it's backed up to the nth degree.
*  So he had a couple of things that I would be concerned about.
*  He took a leap.
*  I don't know.
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  Stepped outside of the journalistic boundaries
*  of what you can absolutely prove and not prove,
*  and took a leap.
*  And that's why I think he took down the Dwayne Reed Pharmacy.
*  He didn't take it down?
*  Oh, it's still there as well?
*  Oh, OK.
*  There it is.
*  There was another thing about a.
*  Oh, he's got the milligrams per day.
*  Wow.
*  Where is this from?
*  He doesn't show it or anything, but I
*  believe he got a copy of it from someone,
*  or he talked to the doctor.
*  Drug was diethylpropan, 75 milligrams a day,
*  prescription filled Dwayne Reed on 57th Street, Manhattan.
*  Not that I know of things.
*  So he's got the doctor's name, too.
*  Dr. Joseph Greenberg.
*  I countered with medical records.
*  A White House admitted to me only a short time for diet
*  that he took it when he was not overweight.
*  OK, then that's fine.
*  He says, I countered with medical records.
*  They cut me off.
*  Wow.
*  I mean, one thing I will say is that when
*  you're covering stories, sometimes you hear things
*  and you know they're pretty solid,
*  but it's not quite reportable because the person won't
*  put their name on it, or you're not 100% sure
*  that the document is a real document.
*  Maybe it's a photocopy.
*  And that can be very, very tough for reporters,
*  because they know something's true, but they can't.
*  And social media has eliminated a barrier
*  that we used to have.
*  We used to have to go through editors and fact checkers,
*  and now you're on Twitter, you can just kind of boop.
*  Or you can hint at something.
*  And I think that's something you don't want to get into
*  as a reporter too much.
*  Yeah, that's a weird use of social media, right?
*  It's like sort of a slippery escape from journalistic rules.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  Or you can insinuate that somebody did X, Y, and Z,
*  or you can use terms that are a little bit sloppy.
*  But it seems like they did admit that he took that stuff for a
*  diet.
*  Yeah, so if you have the White House spokesperson saying
*  that he took it for a short time for a diet,
*  that's a reportable story.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I think when people get into that shit,
*  it's very hard for them to get out of that shit.
*  That's the speed train, and I've seen many people hop on it.
*  It's got a lot of stops.
*  Nobody seems to get off.
*  Yeah, not with their teeth intact, right?
*  Yeah, no, that's not a good way to end.
*  He's so old.
*  He's so old, he doesn't exercise, he eats fast food,
*  and he gets so much fucking energy.
*  I mean, people want to think he's this super person,
*  but maybe he's on speed.
*  Maybe, yeah.
*  Maybe he's just going to collapse, turn over,
*  and collapse one day.
*  Or not.
*  Maybe you can go a lot longer on speed than people think.
*  Maybe if you just do it the right way.
*  But isn't that kind of the way history always works?
*  It's like, again, not to go back to the Russia thing,
*  but all the various terrible leaders of Russia,
*  they all died of natural causes when they were 85, right?
*  Whereas in a country where people get murdered
*  and die of industrial accidents and bad health
*  when they're 30 all the time.
*  But the worst people in the country
*  make it to very old age and die, and they're alcoholics.
*  And maybe that's a thing, right?
*  Maybe he has the worst diet in the world,
*  and maybe he's on speed.
*  Maybe it's also your perception of how
*  you interface with the world.
*  Maybe because he's not this introspective guy that's
*  really worried about how people see him and feel about him,
*  maybe he doesn't feel, whether it's sociopathy or whatever
*  it is, he doesn't feel the bad feelings.
*  They don't get in there.
*  Yeah, and he doesn't have the stress impact, right?
*  And that's the thing about speed, apparently,
*  because of the fact that it makes you feel delusional.
*  And it makes you feel like you're the fucking man.
*  You don't worry about what other people think.
*  It's fucking losers.
*  Who cares?
*  Right, right, yeah, exactly.
*  Let's buy Greenland.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, that was, why not buy Greenland?
*  Why not buy Greenland?
*  Yeah, and then when that came out, I thought,
*  what's wrong with that?
*  We bought Alaska.
*  Well, we leased Alaska, sort of.
*  Yeah, we were supposed to give it back, but we didn't.
*  It seems like Greenland would be a good place to scoop up,
*  especially as things get warmer.
*  Right?
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  And the fucking tweet that he made
*  when he put the Trump Tower, I promise not to do this,
*  and have a giant Trump Tower in the middle of Greenland,
*  I was laughing my ass off.
*  I'm like, love or hate, that is hilarious.
*  His trolling skills are very good.
*  They're fantastic.
*  Oh, he knows how to fuck with people.
*  When he starts calling people crazy,
*  or gives them a nickname, it's so good, because it sticks.
*  It sticks.
*  I mean, part of me wants to see a Trump-Biden race next year
*  just for that reason, just because the abuse will be
*  unbelievable.
*  I mean, not that I'm encouraging that necessarily,
*  but just as a spectacle, it's going to be unbelievable.
*  You can tell that he is salivating at the idea of Biden
*  as an opponent.
*  Biden, to me, is like having a flashlight with a dying battery
*  and going for a long hike in the woods.
*  It is not going to work out.
*  It's not going to make it.
*  Yeah, no, he's so faded.
*  He has his moments on the campaign trail
*  where he'll be speaking.
*  And these guys do the same speech over and over again,
*  so they can kind of do it on cruise control.
*  But every now and then, he'll stop in the middle of it.
*  And this look of terror comes over, like, where am I?
*  What town am I in?
*  He confused.
*  He thought he was in Vermont when he was in New Hampshire.
*  I'm sorry.
*  Yeah, he got those states confused.
*  Like, what's not to love about Vermont?
*  He was in New Hampshire.
*  That can happen, obviously, but it happens to him a lot.
*  But he's clearly old.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, he's not much older than Trump.
*  But he needs to get on the same pills.
*  Yeah, yeah, actually, that would be interesting.
*  We should get a GoFundMe to buy speed.
*  You imagine if they just filled him up with steroids
*  and just jacked him up with amphetamines
*  and had him going after Trump.
*  I really think he needs something like that.
*  Whatever he's doing on the natch, it's not working.
*  Right, yeah, yeah.
*  He's too tired.
*  Needs a little bit of enhancement.
*  It's not going to work.
*  If he gets the nomination, the Democrats are fucked.
*  I just don't see him withstanding the barrage
*  that Trump is going to throw at him.
*  Trump's going to take him out like Tyson took out
*  Marvis Frazier.
*  He's just going to bomb on him.
*  Yeah.
*  That was a bad fight.
*  But it's going to be that kind of fight.
*  Right, right.
*  He's just going to bomb on him.
*  Yeah.
*  He doesn't have a chance.
*  He can't stand with that guy.
*  He doesn't have a chance.
*  He's also too impressed with himself.
*  Yes, he's too used to people deferring to him.
*  Yes.
*  He thinks the things he says make sense and are cool
*  and are profound.
*  When they're just bland, he's just serving bad meatloaf.
*  And he's like, ta-da.
*  And you're like, no, this is bad meatloaf.
*  Yeah, that's how he got to be vice president,
*  by being just bland enough to get whatever constituency
*  Obama was trying to get.
*  But you saw that exchange when he called Trump
*  an existential threat earlier this year.
*  And Trump basically, he just went off on him.
*  Joe's a dummy.
*  He's not the guy he used to be.
*  That's going to be every day, every minute of every day.
*  And then other people are going to chime in,
*  because they love it.
*  People love piling on.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  And his fans, oh my god.
*  He's the asshole king, where people never
*  had a representative before.
*  There's a lot of assholes out there like, where's my guy?
*  And then finally, bam, look at this.
*  There he is.
*  The asshole made it to the White House.
*  Holy shit, I can be an asshole now?
*  The president's an asshole?
*  He wants me to be an asshole?
*  Lock her up.
*  Lock her up.
*  Yeah, lock her up.
*  Yeah, totally.
*  All that's going to wear on a guy.
*  I mean, have you been to one of Trump's rallies?
*  No chance.
*  Yeah, I can't.
*  I have to wear a rubber nose and fucking.
*  I've covered them.
*  And they're unbelievable.
*  First of all, the t-shirts are amazing.
*  Trump 2020, fuck your feelings.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Trump is the punisher.
*  You know, it's like the Punisher Skull, what the thing?
*  It's amazing.
*  And in the crowds, it's totally out of idiocracy.
*  Is there a fucking Punisher Skull with a Trump wig on it?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Oh my goodness, I'm going to have to get one of those.
*  There's the t-shirts.
*  Have you seen Jamie?
*  Jamie, that was such a loud laugh.
*  Oh my god, it's a red, white, and blue American flag skull
*  Punisher style with a Trump wig on it.
*  So I saw that.
*  I need that shirt.
*  It wasn't the red, white, and blue one.
*  It was the one with the black.
*  And I saw that on an eight-year-old kid.
*  It was like a mother with her little kids
*  and the Trump Punisher Skull.
*  Do they sell that shirt on Amazon?
*  Can you find out the shirt?
*  I'm sure it's being sold everywhere.
*  It is now.
*  Oh my god.
*  These are stickers, and these are being sold over at Walmart,
*  eBay.
*  Oh god, these fucking people.
*  I mean, the merch is, he's the most t-shirtable president
*  in history.
*  Trump 2020, grab him by the pussy again.
*  I mean, they embrace that shit.
*  The trolling aspect of all of it is the fun part for his crowd.
*  What they get off on is how freaked out
*  quote unquote liberal audiences are by their appearance,
*  their attitude, and everything.
*  And they lean into it, which is interesting
*  because that kind of group camaraderie thing,
*  you don't really find that in the campaign trail
*  on the Democratic side.
*  It's different.
*  I mean, it's a different vibe entirely, but yeah.
*  It's crazy.
*  Well, it's dumb.
*  And that's the thing that he's sort of captured
*  is this place where you can be dumb.
*  It's fun to be dumb and say grab her by the pussy.
*  Everybody knows that's kind of a dumb thing to say publicly.
*  Of course.
*  But you can say it there, because he said it.
*  Yay.
*  Build that wall.
*  Build that wall.
*  Yay.
*  It's like it's this chance to shut off
*  any possibility of getting over 70 RPM.
*  We're going to cut this bitch off at 70.
*  There's no high function here.
*  Cut it off at 70 and just let it rip.
*  Right.
*  Yeah, totally, totally.
*  And it's funny.
*  The way you say that everybody knows
*  is a dumb thing to say, right?
*  Yes.
*  I would talk to people at the crowds,
*  and I'll talk to a 65-year-old grandmother.
*  And you say, do you agree with everything that Trump says?
*  And almost to the last, they all say,
*  well, I wish he hadn't said this particular thing.
*  But they're all there chanting.
*  You know what I mean?
*  They're all into it.
*  And the crowds are so huge.
*  I was in Cincinnati, and I was late to one of his events.
*  And I made the mistake that I couldn't drive in,
*  because they blocked off all the bridges,
*  if you've ever been there.
*  I was on the Kentucky side.
*  So I had to walk three miles away and walk over a bridge.
*  And I thought I was going to be the only person there.
*  And it was something out of a sci-fi movie.
*  It was just a line of MAGA hats extending over a bridge
*  all the way into Kentucky, a mile down a road.
*  Wow.
*  I mean, they had to turn with thousands of people
*  to get into this event.
*  It's incredible.
*  How many people did it seat?
*  It was like 17,000 or 18,000.
*  It was the, I forget what arena that is.
*  It's the indoor one.
*  Look at the size of those places.
*  He's the only one that can pull those kind of crowds.
*  Period.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  No one can do that.
*  You know, Bernie and Warren have had big crowds.
*  Bernie had a 25,000 person crowd in Queens
*  a couple of weeks ago.
*  You'll see crowds that big.
*  But Trump's crowds are just dating back to 2016.
*  They're just consistently huge everywhere.
*  And again, this gets back to what I was saying before.
*  All the reporters saw this.
*  And they all saw that Hillary was having real trouble getting
*  4,000 and 5,000 people into her events.
*  And so we were all talking to each other.
*  That's got to be a thing that's going to play a role
*  in the election eventually.
*  But nobody kind of brought it up, or they explained it away.
*  Well, I think they felt like if you discussed it
*  and brought it up, that somehow or another you
*  were contributing to Trump winning.
*  Right, but that's a fallacious way to look at it.
*  Because covering up the reality of the situation,
*  I think, created a false sense of security for Democrats.
*  And they thought they were going to win by a landslide.
*  That's what everybody was saying, but it wasn't true.
*  I mean, there were serious red flags
*  throughout the campaign for Hillary.
*  And people, I think, were too afraid to bring up
*  a lot of this stuff because they didn't want
*  to be seen as helping Trump.
*  But that's not what the business is about.
*  We're not supposed to be, you know.
*  Helping people.
*  Facts don't have political indications.
*  We're just supposed to tell you what we see.
*  How do you get journalism back on track?
*  Is it possible at this point?
*  I mean, is it a lost art?
*  Is it going to be like calligraphy?
*  I mean, I think.
*  Yeah, right.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  Japanese calligraphy, you have to pass it down
*  through masters.
*  Yeah, maybe that's going to be what journalism is like.
*  I mean, there's two things that could happen.
*  One is that, like, if you created something like Neither
*  Side News right now, and just like a.
*  That's a great name.
*  Yeah, like a network where it was a bunch of people
*  who just kind of did the job without the editorializing.
*  I think it would have.
*  It would probably have a lot of followers right away.
*  It would make money.
*  And nobody has clued into that yet.
*  Like if some candy entrepreneur were to do that
*  and that were to bring back the business, that or, you know,
*  journalism has always been kind of quasi subsidized
*  in this country.
*  You know, going back to the Pony Express newspapers
*  were carried free across to the West, right?
*  The US Postal Service did that.
*  The original 19, the Communications Act in 1934,
*  the idea was, you know, you could lease the public airways,
*  but you had to do something in the public interest.
*  So you could make money doing sports and entertainment,
*  but you could take a loss on news.
*  And so it was kind of quasi subsidized in that way.
*  But that doesn't exist anymore.
*  There's no subsidy really for news anymore.
*  I'm not necessarily sure I agree with that being the way
*  to go, but there has to be something.
*  Because right now, the financial pressure to be bad
*  is too great, you know?
*  Like there's no way to, sorry to go on this bit,
*  but when I came from the business,
*  when the money started getting tighter,
*  the first thing they got rid of were the long form
*  investigative reporters.
*  Like you couldn't just hire somebody to work on a story
*  for three months anymore because you needed them
*  to do content all the time.
*  Then they got rid of the fact checkers, you know,
*  which had another serious problem, you know?
*  And so now the money's so tight that you just have these
*  people doing click bait all the time,
*  and they're not doing real reporting,
*  and so they have to fix the money problem.
*  I don't know how they would do that though.
*  How much has it changed recently?
*  Because like when that piece, the stuff that you wrote
*  about the banking crisis was my favorite coverage of it,
*  and the most relatable and understandable,
*  and the way you spelled everything out.
*  Could you do that today?
*  Yeah, but I think it would be harder because-
*  That's not that long ago.
*  It really isn't.
*  It's only, you know, that was, I really stopped doing that
*  in like 2014 or so.
*  But-
*  So it was five years out.
*  But the big difference is social media's had a huge
*  impact on attention span.
*  So, you know, I was writing like 7,000 word articles
*  about credit default swaps and stuff like that.
*  And I was trying really hard to make it interesting
*  for people, you know, you use jokes and humor
*  and stuff like that.
*  But now people would not have the energy
*  to really fight through that.
*  You'd have to make it shorter.
*  Even TV, you know, they, people, you don't see
*  that kind of reporting, that in-depth, you know,
*  kind of process reporting where you're teaching people
*  something because people just tune out right away.
*  Like they need just a quick hit, a headline,
*  and a couple of facts.
*  So yeah, there's a big problem with audience, right?
*  We've trained audiences to consume the news differently.
*  And all they really want to get is a take now, you know?
*  Everything's like an ESPN hot take on things, you know?
*  So that's not good.
*  The counter to that though is this,
*  what we're doing right now.
*  Like these are always these long ass conversations.
*  They're hours and hours long.
*  And there's a bunch of them out there now.
*  It's not like mine is an isolated one.
*  And there's so many podcasts that cover,
*  and some of them cover them like in a serial form,
*  like the Dropout, was that what they called it?
*  Yes, it was the Dropout was the one about that woman
*  who created that fake blood company.
*  Oh yes, right.
*  Susan, what was her name?
*  Elizabeth.
*  What is her name?
*  Elizabeth Holmes.
*  That's right, Theranos.
*  Yeah, the completely fraudulent company.
*  That was an amazing podcast series
*  that if I read it, I probably, you're right,
*  I probably would have like, oh, boring.
*  I probably would have abandoned it earlier.
*  But listening to it in podcast form,
*  listening to actual conversations from these people,
*  listening to people's interpretations
*  of these conversations,
*  listening to people that were there at the time,
*  telling stories about when they knew things were weird,
*  and when they started noticing there's tests
*  that were incorrect, that they were covering up,
*  that kind of shit.
*  Like you can do that now with something like this.
*  And I think that one of the good things about podcasts too
*  is you don't need anybody to tell you
*  that you could publish this.
*  Yeah, no, absolutely.
*  I think you're right.
*  And I think formats like this reveal
*  that the news companies are wrong
*  about some things, about audiences.
*  Like they think that people can't handle
*  an in-depth discussion about things.
*  They think that audiences only wanna watch
*  30 seconds of something.
*  They don't, they're interested.
*  They do have curiosity about things.
*  It's just, it's very difficult to convince people
*  in the news business especially
*  to take chances on that kind of content.
*  They'll do it for a podcast,
*  they'll do it for a documentary.
*  But for the news, they're making things shorter
*  and shorter and shorter.
*  I was really lucky to have an editor who understood
*  the idea that we have to get into this in depth,
*  or else it's gonna be meaningless to people, right?
*  That's pretty rare.
*  For the most part, you don't see them
*  taking that kind of bet anymore.
*  But maybe podcasts will help people puncture that.
*  But the flip side of that is that they're not investing
*  in stuff like international news in the way they used to.
*  Like when I came up in the business,
*  every bureau, every big network had bureaus
*  in every major city around the world,
*  Rome, Berlin, Moscow, whatever it is, right?
*  And they had newsrooms full of people
*  who were out there gathering news.
*  Now there's none of that, right?
*  Because they figured out they can make the money
*  just as easily by having somebody sit in an office
*  in Washington or New York and just link to something
*  and have a take on something.
*  So I think the news is getting worse,
*  podcasts are getting more interesting.
*  Maybe there's a happy medium they can find in between.
*  Well, documentaries as well.
*  Documentaries are commercially viable
*  if it's a great subject.
*  Like your good example is that Wild Wild Country one.
*  I didn't even know that that cult existed.
*  I had no idea what happened up there.
*  And then so this documentary sheds light on it,
*  does it over like, I think it was like six episodes
*  or something like that.
*  It was fucking amazing and it made a shit ton of money.
*  Or Making a Murderer was another one
*  that was really good.
*  Like you take, cause that's something that happens
*  all over the place.
*  You have these criminal justice cases
*  and they're terrible and justices happen.
*  And if you really tell the whole story
*  and make characters out of people
*  and invest the time and energy to tell it well,
*  people still like really good storytelling.
*  But I think within the news business,
*  they just, they have this belief,
*  their hard headed belief
*  that people can't handle difficult material.
*  And I don't know why that is.
*  Yeah, I don't know why it is either.
*  It's, I mean, I think there's a large number of people
*  that aren't satisfied intellectually by a lot of the stuff
*  they're being spoon fed.
*  They think that because the vast majority of things
*  that are commercially viable
*  are short attention span things.
*  I think it's like this real sloppy way of thinking,
*  non risk taking way of thinking.
*  They're like, well, this is how people consume things.
*  You gotta give them like a music video style editing
*  or they just tune out.
*  But there's always been a thirst
*  for actual long form conversations.
*  Yeah.
*  You don't, an actual real in depth exploration
*  of something in a very digestible way.
*  Like one of the good things about doing your podcast
*  or this podcast, any podcast really,
*  is that you can listen to it while you're commuting.
*  You listen to it and it'll actually give you something
*  that occupies your mind and interests you
*  during what would normally be dead time.
*  Right, yeah.
*  And you're absolutely right about the thirst
*  for something else.
*  And again, I think when people turn on most news products,
*  they're getting this predictable set of things
*  and that doesn't quench that thirst for them.
*  They're not being challenged in any way.
*  They're not seeing different sides of a topic.
*  You're not approaching covering a subject honestly
*  by genuinely exploring the idea
*  that people you may have thought were bad are right
*  or people you may have thought are good or wrong.
*  It's just all predictable.
*  So I think people are fleeing to other things now, right?
*  They just, they want to just get the story.
*  They don't wanna have a whole lot of editorializing
*  on top of it.
*  Yeah, and yeah.
*  And I think also there's a lot of underestimating
*  of audiences going out there.
*  Like we just think that they can't handle stuff
*  when they can.
*  Yeah.
*  They're interested, but we just take it for granted
*  that they can't do it.
*  Maybe I'm guilty of that too,
*  cause I've been doing this for so long,
*  but yeah, it does happen.
*  I don't think people have changed that much.
*  Yeah, no, probably not.
*  It's just difficult.
*  Maybe it's also, we don't have the stamina
*  to stick with a story in the same way that we used to.
*  Like now if a story doesn't get a million hits right away,
*  we don't return to the subject.
*  You think about stories like Watergate.
*  Like when Woodward and Bernstein first did those stories,
*  they were complete duds.
*  Everybody thought they were on the wrong path.
*  They were the only people who were covering it.
*  And a lot of those stories kind of flailed around.
*  You know what I mean?
*  They didn't get the big response.
*  And it wasn't until much later that it became this hot thing
*  that everybody was watching.
*  And you wouldn't, so that wouldn't happen now, right?
*  Like if reporters were on a story,
*  if it didn't catch fire within the first couple of passes,
*  your editor's probably gonna take you off it now.
*  What was that story that the New York Times worked on
*  about Trump and they worked on it for a long time
*  and it was released and went in and out of the news cycle
*  in a matter of days and nobody gave a fuck?
*  Yeah, the one about his finances.
*  Yes.
*  And it was like a 36,000 word story.
*  It was like unbelievable.
*  It was like six times as big as the biggest story
*  I've ever written in my life.
*  They thought it was a giant take down.
*  Right, yeah.
*  And it was, it was like a 36 hour thing, if that, right?
*  Maybe.
*  Maybe, yeah.
*  And people kind of said, oh, this is amazing.
*  It's got all this information in it
*  and it just fell flat, you know?
*  And that's, and the important thing about that
*  is that news companies see this and they say,
*  wow, we invested all this time and money.
*  We put our really good reporters on this.
*  We gave them six months to work on something
*  and it got the same amount of hits as, you know,
*  some story about, you know, a carp with a human face
*  that was filmed in China, you know what I mean?
*  Like some thing that we, you know, we picked off the wires
*  and we stuck it in page 11, whatever it was.
*  So then what that tells them, the incentives now are,
*  let's not bother.
*  Let's not do six months investigations of anything anymore
*  because what's the point?
*  We're gonna get as many hits doing something dumb, you know?
*  So they just don't take the risk anymore.
*  God, it's so crazy that that's the incentive now
*  that it's all clicks.
*  It's such a strange trap to fall into.
*  And there's also the other thing,
*  which is the litigation problem, you know,
*  and this is another thing I wrote about in the book
*  is that there was a series of cases in the 80s and 90s
*  where reporters kind of took on big companies.
*  I remember the Chiquita Banana thing
*  that the Cincinnati Inquirer did.
*  Remember the movie, The Insider,
*  about Brian and Williamson, the tobacco company, CBS, right?
*  There was another one with Monsanto in Florida
*  where some Fox reporters went after Monsanto.
*  So they all got sued and it cost their companies
*  a ton of money and reputational risk.
*  And so after that, what news companies said is,
*  why take on a big company that can fight back
*  and throw a lawsuit at us?
*  And what do we win by that?
*  We're not gonna get more audience from that, you know?
*  So now if you watch consumer reporting, you know,
*  like a small TV station,
*  they're gonna bang on some little Chinese restaurant
*  that has roaches or something like that.
*  They're not gonna go after Monsanto or, you know,
*  Chiquita Banana because there's no point.
*  It's too much of a risk, so they just don't do it.
*  And that's another thing that's gone wrong with reporting.
*  The economic benefit of going after a powerful adversary
*  isn't there anymore, so they don't do it.
*  And that's a problem.
*  Clearly, you've seen a giant change in journalism
*  from when you first started to where we are now.
*  Do you have any fears or concerns about the future of it?
*  I mean, this is what you do for a living.
*  What are your thoughts on it?
*  Where do you think it's going?
*  I mean, I'm really worried about it because
*  you need the journalists to kind of exist apart
*  from politics and to be a check on everything, right?
*  The whole idea of having a fourth estate
*  is that it's separate from the political parties, right?
*  I mean, I don't work for the DNC.
*  It's not my job to write bad news about Donald Trump, right?
*  That's the DNC's job.
*  They put up press releases about them.
*  And if people see us as being indistinguishable
*  from political parties or being all editorial,
*  then we don't have any power anymore.
*  Like, that's the first thing.
*  The press doesn't have any ability to influence people.
*  If people don't see us as independent and truthful
*  and all those things.
*  And so that's what I really worry about right now
*  is like people will stop listening to the media.
*  They'll still tune us out.
*  They don't trust us anymore.
*  And like Walter Cronkite from, you know, 1972,
*  the Gallup poll agency found
*  that he was the most trusted man in America.
*  And that was true also in 1985,
*  like for 13 consecutive years, he was the most trusted.
*  There's no reporter in America who's trusted.
*  The most trusted man in America.
*  It doesn't exist.
*  Yeah, it doesn't exist.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  So people think of us as clowns and, you know,
*  entertainment figures.
*  And so how are you gonna impact the world
*  if people think you're a joke, you know?
*  And that's why, that's what I really worry about.
*  We don't have any institutional self-respect anymore.
*  You know, we don't feel like we have to, you know,
*  challenge audiences, challenge powerful people.
*  It's just a bunch of talking points
*  and that's not what the business is about.
*  So I worry about it.
*  And, you know, I think there are a lot of journalists
*  who kind of say the same thing.
*  We all kind of talk amongst ourselves,
*  which is, you know, the job as we knew it
*  is kind of being phased out and changed into something else.
*  And that's not a good thing, you know,
*  because people do need, in tough times,
*  people need the press, you know,
*  as ridiculous as that sounds now, because, but it's true.
*  And I don't know where we go from here.
*  Legitimate journalism is so important.
*  It's so important.
*  It's the only way you really find out what's going on.
*  It's the only way.
*  You're not gonna find out through the depictions
*  of the people that were actually involved in it
*  that want you to see it a certain way.
*  You're not gonna find that from people
*  that have financial incentives
*  and giving you a specific narrative.
*  You need real journalism.
*  It's so hard to find.
*  And I think it's one of the reasons why we're so lost.
*  It's one of the more insidious aspects of the term fake news,
*  because goddamn, that's so easy to throw around.
*  It's like, it's so easy to call someone a bigot.
*  It's so easy to call someone a racist.
*  And it's so easy to say fake news.
*  And although they all have the same sort of effect,
*  they just diminish anything that you have to say
*  almost instantaneously.
*  Totally.
*  And there's, when you can cast the entire news
*  as being fake, people can tune in and tune out.
*  But a lot of that has to do with,
*  who's doing the news reading now?
*  In the 60s and 70s, maybe before,
*  reporters, a lot of them came from the middle lower classes.
*  The job was originally kind of like being a plumber.
*  It was more of a trade than a profession.
*  And so you had a lot of people who went into the job
*  and they had this kind of attitude
*  of just wanting to stick it to the man.
*  They didn't wanna be close to power.
*  They wanted to take it on.
*  People like Seymour Hersh, right?
*  Like if you see that kind of personality
*  who just wants to take the truth
*  and rub it in somebody's face.
*  But then after all the president's men,
*  it became this sexy thing to be a journalist.
*  And you saw a lot of people from my generation
*  who went into journalism
*  because they wanted to be close to politicians
*  and hang out with them.
*  It's kind of like the primary colors thing, right?
*  Where you see people who they just wanna like have a beer
*  with the presidential candidate.
*  And that's totally different from what it used to be.
*  Like now we're on the wrong side of the rope line.
*  You see what I'm saying?
*  Like we used to be outside of power, like taking it on.
*  And now we're more upper class in the press
*  and we're kind of in bed with the same people
*  we were supposed to be covering.
*  And that's not a good thing.
*  When people see that, that's one of the reasons
*  why they call us fake news
*  because they see us as doing PR for rich people.
*  One of my favorite books ever about politics
*  is Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail.
*  And I wrote the introduction to that.
*  Did you?
*  Yeah, the last edition of that.
*  That's- Greatest book.
*  It's a fantastic book.
*  And it's a great example of someone who knew
*  that they weren't a part of that system
*  so they could talk about it as an outsider.
*  He knew he was only gonna be covering it for a year.
*  So he just went in guns blazing,
*  got everybody fucked up, drinking on the bus,
*  making everybody do acid.
*  Burned all of them.
*  Yeah, and he says that in the book.
*  He's like, look, this isn't my beat.
*  I don't have any friends I have to keep.
*  So I'm gonna tell you everything that I see and fuck it.
*  And that's a real problem in reporting.
*  When you're in a beat for too long,
*  you end up developing unhealthy relationships with sources
*  and you end up in a position
*  where you're not gonna burn the people
*  who you're dependent on to get your information.
*  And when that happens to reporters,
*  I think that's one of the reasons it's good
*  to kind of cycle through different topics
*  over the course of your career.
*  If you get stuck in the same beat too long,
*  eventually you fall into that trap.
*  And Thompson, of course, never did that.
*  Every story that he covered was he let it all hang out
*  and just said whatever the hell he thought
*  and he let the chips fall where they may.
*  And that's kind of the way,
*  I mean, you can't do that all the time probably,
*  but I think that's the thing.
*  That was great.
*  It was amazing.
*  And there's no other examples of it.
*  No, no.
*  Not like that.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  I mean, that book was so great on so many levels.
*  Like he, I always thought of it as being also
*  kind of like a novel,
*  because it's this story about this person
*  who's like obsessed with finding meaning and truth,
*  but he goes to the most fake place on earth,
*  which is the campaign trail to look for it.
*  And so all these depictions
*  to all these terrible lying people,
*  they're just so hilarious.
*  And so it's kind of,
*  it's almost like a Franz Kafka novel.
*  It's amazing.
*  And then it's great journalism at the same time.
*  Like he's telling you how the system works
*  and how elections work and it's really valuable for that.
*  So yeah, that was brilliant.
*  He also changed a lot.
*  I mean, he actually affected politicians.
*  Like the shit that he did with Ed Muskie.
*  Oh my God, yeah.
*  He boogane.
*  That was fantastic.
*  When he was on the Dick Cavett show
*  and Dick Cavett asked him about it,
*  he goes, well, there's a rumor that he was on Ibogaine
*  and I started that rumor.
*  I mean, it's just,
*  he like literally that he got in that guy's head.
*  Oh yeah.
*  And I remember he put that picture of Muskie
*  and he just found a picture of Muskie
*  and he's basically wearing like that.
*  The caption is Muskie in the throes
*  of an Ibogaine frenzy, right?
*  You couldn't really get away with that now.
*  Like he just, you know.
*  Well, it's a crazy drug to choose too
*  because it's a drug that gets you off addictions.
*  Right, yeah, exactly.
*  It's one of the more hilarious aspects of his choice.
*  But it sounded great.
*  Yeah.
*  And with the witch doctor and all that stuff.
*  Brazilian witch doctor.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  It was fantastic.
*  Oh, so good.
*  Yeah, but you know, that kind of stuff
*  probably wouldn't go over all that well right now.
*  No, it'd get sued.
*  Yeah, but also he had
*  this very, very sort of aggressively
*  caricaturizing way of looking at politics
*  and politicians and that wouldn't go over
*  that well now either.
*  Like people don't want you to rip on the process
*  as much as he did in that book.
*  So it was great.
*  It was just a fantastic book.
*  Yeah, I mean, he had a bunch of them that were great,
*  but that one particularly, you can sort of redo it.
*  You could reread it every time
*  we get to an election cycle.
*  And he sort of goes, oh, it lets you know,
*  these are repeating cycles.
*  This is just like the same shit that he was dealing with
*  in various different forms.
*  But you can see it all today.
*  And it's funny, the reporters, everybody's read that book,
*  everybody who covers campaigns.
*  I'm on my fifth right now for Rolling Stone.
*  Like I have his old job.
*  And everybody has read that book.
*  And so they unconsciously try to make the same characters
*  in each election cycle.
*  So there's always like a Christ-like McGovern figure.
*  There's a turncoat, quizzling, spineless, musky figure.
*  There's the villain, Nixon.
*  Trump kind of fills that role for a lot of reporters now.
*  And then a lot of them try to behave in the same way
*  that their characters behaved in that book.
*  So you remember Frank Mankiewicz
*  who was McGovern's sort of handler.
*  And he was having beers with Thompson after the events
*  and kind of strategizing with them.
*  Reporters try to do that.
*  They all try to do that with the candidates
*  and their handlers.
*  Now they try to develop those same relationships.
*  It's just interesting.
*  It's like they're reliving the book.
*  That's a problem with someone that's really good.
*  They take on so many imitators.
*  So many imitators take on their demeanor
*  or their thought process.
*  And Hunter was just such an iconic version of a writer
*  that it's so difficult if you're a fan of his
*  to not wanna be like that guy.
*  Oh, totally.
*  I mean, I know that.
*  Especially because I'm writing for the same magazine
*  and covering a lot of the same topics.
*  You have to immediately realize
*  that you can't do what he did.
*  Thompson's writing was incredibly ambitious and unique.
*  He was using a lot of the same techniques
*  that the great fiction writers use.
*  He was creating almost like this four dimensional story,
*  but at the same time it was also journalism.
*  Most people couldn't get away with that.
*  You have to be a great, great writer.
*  I'm talking like rare Mark Twain level talent
*  to really do what he did,
*  which is to kind of mix the ambition of great fiction
*  with journalism.
*  So if you try to do that stuff, it's gonna be terrible.
*  And I've done, I've certainly,
*  if you go back and look at my writing,
*  you'll find a lot of like shitty Thompson imitations.
*  And so I learned to not do that pretty early.
*  But yeah, it's one of those,
*  don't try this at home things for young writers
*  if you can avoid that for sure.
*  Do you have any, do you have any hope?
*  Is there anything that you look to,
*  you go maybe this is going to be where this turns around
*  in terms of journalism, in terms of like?
*  Yes, I mean, I think, I mean, oddly enough,
*  I think your shows like yours
*  and the kind of proliferation
*  of like what you're talking about with podcasts.
*  The great thing about the internet,
*  there are lots of bad things.
*  But the great thing about it is that it's given,
*  it's provided a way for people to just have an audience
*  if they're good, right?
*  If people have a demand for it,
*  they're gonna, if there's a demand for it, you can exist.
*  You can have a platform.
*  And so that's what I think is gonna happen
*  is that people are gonna crack the code
*  of what kind of journalism people want.
*  And they're gonna create something
*  that people are gonna flock to.
*  And I don't have a lot of faith that CBS, MSNBC, ABC, CNN,
*  that they're gonna figure out.
*  Like, I think it's gonna be some independent kind of voice
*  that is going to come up with something, a new formula.
*  And people are, that is gonna rise up.
*  I mean, you've seen it a little bit with things
*  like the Young Turks, although they're,
*  they've changed a little bit,
*  but they figured out that if you provide something
*  that's an alternative from the usual thing,
*  that you can get a viable functioning business
*  a lot faster than you used to be able to.
*  What do you mean by they changed?
*  I think they've kind of become a little bit more
*  in the direction of a traditional news organization
*  than they were originally, maybe.
*  I don't know, I don't watch it as much as I used to.
*  So maybe I shouldn't say that.
*  But again, the ability to do that is a lot different
*  than it used to be.
*  Like in order to have an independent journalism outlet,
*  you used to have to, like for instance,
*  put out your own newspaper, which do your own distribution,
*  do your own printing, do your own design.
*  All that stuff cost a ton of money.
*  And it was very, very hard to do it
*  without big corporate sponsors.
*  Now, anybody with a good idea can pretty much do something
*  and so I have a lot of hope
*  that somebody's gonna figure it out.
*  It's just we're not there yet.
*  I agree with you.
*  I'm optimistic.
*  I have a lot of hope too, but I'm always like,
*  fuck, hurry up already.
*  Yeah, I know, I know.
*  And it's just until we get there,
*  the remnants of the old system of media,
*  they're just, it's just so tough to watch.
*  Flailing.
*  Yeah, they're flailing.
*  They don't really know what to do.
*  They're kind of caught between just purely chasing the money
*  and trying to adhere to what they thought the news
*  looked like in the past.
*  So it's like not entertaining.
*  If they were just chasing the money,
*  if they just come up organically today,
*  they would have had a different product entirely,
*  but they're trying to sound like legitimate news,
*  but they're also completely selling out at the same time
*  and it's just not working.
*  And so, yeah, we'll see where all that goes,
*  but we're not here.
*  You're right, they're flailing right now.
*  Well, Matt Taibbi, I appreciate you, man.
*  Thanks a lot, Joe.
*  I really do.
