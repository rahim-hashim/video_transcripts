# JRE MMA Show #82 with Israel Adesanya
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [November 11, 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZKhfZ25L4o)
*  Three, two, ladies and gentlemen, the champ is here.
*  My man.
*  Salute.
*  Salute.
*  Last time.
*  Last time you were here, you were neither the interim nor the undisputed.
*  Now you got it all.
*  I'm the double interim champ.
*  You got it.
*  Why say double?
*  You keep saying that, double interim.
*  Double interim.
*  I don't know.
*  Robert Whitaker's the champ.
*  Yeah, he was.
*  You knocked him out.
*  You're the champ.
*  Because when I was there, even my last fight, I feel like it's my first title defense,
*  to be honest.
*  I was waiting for something to change.
*  I was waiting for that feeling that I had in Atlanta, but never came.
*  And within three days, I felt like I just defended the belt.
*  Because technically, I was the champ as well.
*  I was the champ.
*  And if he had beat me, he would have got one of those rubies you put on this.
*  So I'm looking for my ruby as well.
*  They get a ruby?
*  Yeah, that's the thing.
*  You know how you used to get a new belt?
*  Yeah.
*  You don't get a new belt anymore.
*  So what they do is, you send this off.
*  This isn't actually my one.
*  I've sent it off.
*  This isn't yours?
*  Yeah.
*  You sent yours already.
*  You take this plaque off, this plaque on the side, and then you send it off.
*  Then they put a ruby and send it back to you.
*  They put a ruby in the plaque?
*  Yeah.
*  So you collect the Infinity Stones or whatever.
*  Oh, so that's shit.
*  So I got the Soul Stone.
*  Oh.
*  Yeah.
*  Dude, I used to not like this belt.
*  Now I like it better.
*  It's grown.
*  Yeah.
*  It took me maybe two days after everyone complained about it.
*  Then I looked at it, and when I first saw it, I think it was at the PI.
*  And I was like, you know what?
*  I fuck with it.
*  Yeah.
*  For a while, I was like, ah, the old one was better.
*  Now I'm like, I don't think so anymore.
*  I like this one.
*  Yeah.
*  It gets you every time.
*  This one's cleaner.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just like sharp.
*  More legible.
*  The old one, it was cool.
*  And I still like to, I could buy one on the website, hopefully.
*  Yeah, but those are light.
*  Yeah.
*  But you just for like nostalgic purposes.
*  And just because, you know, I've been a fan, I should have got one of those.
*  I came at the end of it.
*  Colby's still walking around with one.
*  Man, don't get attached to these things, man.
*  I only tell you, I flex with them for a little bit, you know, because even my last, after
*  Atlanta, my coach, he was kind of worried because I was going to Nigeria.
*  I was going to all these shows.
*  I got to like show it off, flex it.
*  But he's my coach.
*  So Eugene's like, man, you know, don't think you're the champ yet.
*  But I'm like, yeah, I'm the champ.
*  But then there was a point when we moved gyms and I just kind of, all right, put in this
*  box with everything else.
*  And then he kind of posted about it because he saw like, okay, the switch happened, like
*  his game time now.
*  So same thing.
*  I'm doing my tour right now, victory tour, walk around, do all this shit.
*  But then even being at the fights last week, I got FOMO because, you know, after the fights,
*  I see what's up, people talking about me right away.
*  So I'm like, man, I got to get back to the gym.
*  So when I get back, I don't even look at this thing.
*  That's interesting.
*  So you're aware that you could get too into the moment.
*  You can get too wrapped up in the fact that you won the title and maybe slack off a little,
*  but maybe take yourself too seriously.
*  Yeah, because I mean, a lot of people, this is their goal.
*  They're like, I want to become the UFC champion.
*  They get it done and then what happens after in the next fight, they lose it or they lose
*  their sight track of what really matters.
*  So some guys like Kobe, for example, he's walking around with the belt when Usman whips
*  his ass or if Usman whips his ass, then what's going to happen?
*  You're going to walk around with that belt.
*  How are you going to feel?
*  Well, the Kobe thing is interesting.
*  And I don't know how much Kobe wants people talking about this, but I'm going to spill
*  it as much as I can.
*  That's an act, man.
*  That's a strong act that he put on when they were ready to cut him.
*  They were ready to cut.
*  You talk to that guy in real life.
*  He's very respectful.
*  Just being around him, just being and said he's the nicest guy.
*  He's a nice guy.
*  He's playing a pro wrestling heel and he's got the whole world worked up.
*  It sells.
*  It sells.
*  And here's the thing though.
*  This is where it's interesting.
*  It tricks people because he seems like a goof.
*  He's wears a stupid fucking cheap blue suit.
*  He wears that MAGA hat.
*  He's got the old belt.
*  You know it's not a legit belt, right?
*  But he did win the interim title and they took it from him for no reason.
*  It doesn't make any sense.
*  So there's this thing about him where people somehow or another think like maybe he's illegitimate.
*  Maybe he's not real.
*  Then he fucks Robbie Lawler up.
*  He can work.
*  And you go, oh Jesus, this guy doesn't get tired.
*  He can strike.
*  His wrestling's on point.
*  His fucking cardio's off the chart.
*  He's tough as nails.
*  I was impressed from the inside.
*  He's legit.
*  Especially when he put Robbie against the fence.
*  He was right there slipping and ripping.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Some things, you know, everyone has holes in their game.
*  I have holes in my game.
*  But he was really impressive.
*  The way he was right there in his face against Robbie Lawler.
*  He's not an elite striker in the sense of like he's a guy who will slip and then blast
*  someone unconscious with one shot.
*  He's a volume guy.
*  He's throwing 60%.
*  50, 60%.
*  Just on you, on you, on you.
*  Never let you rest.
*  Never let you rest.
*  And Robbie in that fight.
*  And Robbie's a fucking all-time great welterweight champion.
*  I mean he was a legit top of the food chain motherfucker and he was looking for those
*  openings that were never there.
*  He was always looking for Colby to slow down.
*  Colby never slowed down.
*  He was waiting.
*  You would see him just waiting, waiting.
*  And he was just buying his time, buying his time.
*  Looking to explode.
*  And say, okay, fuck, fuck.
*  Here it is.
*  Here it is.
*  And there's ways to do that.
*  I did it against Whitaker as well.
*  You see it.
*  Excuse me.
*  I always got a burp.
*  There's times when he'll like, I'll put a clip of this.
*  It's like a simple one.
*  Shifting.
*  Real simple, subtle thing.
*  Just move.
*  Two step.
*  One, two.
*  That's it.
*  I can see it when he'll like bounce, bounce.
*  All right.
*  I'm ready to go.
*  You shift.
*  You disrupt the pattern.
*  Like you said.
*  About to attack.
*  Wonder Boy did it to Lukey the past weekend.
*  You know, whenever he was bouncing, he's either, he's going to bounce, bounce, and then Wonder
*  Boy shifts.
*  So he was doing it with the offense, bounce, bounce, bounce, attack.
*  So he was just, that's all about rhythm.
*  I love that.
*  Yes.
*  Well you have something that Wonder Boy has that a few other people have in that you're
*  a specialist.
*  In that being a specialist, and obviously you have a full game.
*  There's no way you get to where you are without a full game.
*  But you are an elite striker. Thank you. And with that that's that's a giant advantage because on the feet
*  You are a step ahead of everybody every fight star standing on the feet. You see it with Whitaker because Whitaker is a great striker
*  He's a tough guy, but he had holes in his game. Maybe he didn't even know he had yeah
*  But you you could see what it was
*  I got in his head and everyone like when I can see this kind of stuff man
*  Before the press before the fight the press conference when he was talking and acting all unbothered and stuff like that
*  And I was like what he's acting out of character people
*  He put this meme up right and then people thought I was affected by the meme
*  But all that showed me was like you've never talked shit or poked fun at anyone you're fighting
*  But somehow suddenly you're poking fun at me that's showing your first card showing your first hand
*  And a lot of things he's did throughout the like back back tracking and whatnot
*  I was like you're showing me your hand you're acting out of character
*  Even my coach said the same thing and I said just do what got you to the dance
*  Don't try and talk shit with a guy who knows how to talk shit
*  I know he knows how to talk shit with his friends and shit like that
*  But not with me the internet kid is different don't make memes against me. I'm the mean majesty
*  But like yeah, so and then when he come when he came to the cage, you know
*  So you saw me when I walked up I stumped the yard
*  Stumped the yard now I entered the cage and when he came in I could I could feel it
*  He was fucking go, you know beating this just thing he did
*  And he took about a minute in the bit before you look me in the eyes
*  And I was looking at him the whole time and he like a cat you corner even a chicken get one of your chickens corner
*  It like a rooster. It's dangerous
*  When you corner any kind of beast they'll attack you at any point
*  So I could see him pacing back and forth like a caged animal and the whole time like he was a hunt
*  he was a hunted and I was the I was I was a hunter so I was watching him and I could feel it like
*  You know really about this and he's trying to hype himself. Let's fucking go and I could just smell that and when I went on my stance
*  I say whoop whoop like this is something I was doing during sparring like during my my training camp
*  So I was just triggering this this memory like muscle memory in my head and I was just having fun
*  There's a point I looked at him. I kind of smiled like fuck. Yeah, I got this and I just knew from that point
*  Then I was honest and the first round I thought I lost the first round without the knockdown just like I let him have it
*  But then I watched it back. I threw less strikes
*  I landed more he threw more strikes and then the list all I was doing was just and me and Eugene talked about this
*  Like let the first round the first half of the fight. Let's see what he does
*  Just get all his attacks draw make him show his hand make him draw, you know
*  Draw the attacks out of him and I did that and after I watched it again
*  I was like, yeah without the knock that I still had the round
*  It was a brilliant performance and the the knockdown at the end of the first round was essentially the end of the fight
*  Yeah, he was fucked up. It was there was a bad knockdown. You could see when he went back to his corner
*  There's there's a moment where you see his eyes are just not quite there
*  Yeah, like after the even before the second round he stood up and when Kelvin rocked me after I got rocked my first
*  Time being rocked in the UFC in
*  The second round I was before the second I was I let's go let's step it up
*  He was looking at the screen Robert was looking at the screen like what hit me won't hit me and I was like, hey
*  Hey, that's in the past. That's done focus on me right now anyway
*  Let's go. Yeah
*  When it was over when they stopped the fight you raise your hand
*  What's that feeling like knowing that you're the undisputed champ?
*  It felt like just my title defense honestly, Atlanta Atlanta was the one where they put my hand up and I felt like yes
*  Why why Atlanta why that because the fight so hard?
*  Yeah, I think cuz of the way the fight went the back and forth and then me that that fifth round like I
*  Found out who I was after that that fifth run. I found out the depths. I'm willing to go
*  So when they put my hand up and you know, you're beat up and all that kind of stuff just and also I never had a
*  Belt before so I've never had it wrapped around my waist as I visualized it
*  So once that happened boom, I felt like yes, and also I was looking I was like, please judges
*  Don't screw me over. Don't fuck me over on this man, and I knew I had it but you know, you never know exactly
*  bro
*  Look at the Darren till gas and fight. So when they put my hand up, I was like, yes
*  But then this time they put my hand up. I was like, all right
*  What's the end thing is I my brain wants to move forward
*  Because I did it in kickboxing because I was undefeated for so long. So it was always I cool. What's next?
*  I'll watch the fight maybe once study it. All right, what's next? But now I have to like chill
*  relax
*  Look at the tape look at what you've done and then soak it in smell the roses for a little bit and then move on
*  Yeah, cuz once I had my first loss I
*  Took winning for granted because it was just a habit. I was always winning always winning always winning
*  So now I have to like when you win we do something amazing like I did in Atlanta like I did in Melbourne
*  Just chill smell the roses and then move forward
*  When you entered the fifth round against Kelvin you said I'm ready to die
*  It was I looked at him and I remember I call it s a Diablo
*  He was looking at me and he just had this like look and he's just swinging his hands and I said
*  You're not gonna beat me. I'm prepared to die and I meant that man. I swear to God on my life
*  I meant that I'm even getting goosebumps think see that again
*  Like I meant that shit cuz I was like look and I sign I signed my death warrant right there
*  I was like look if this is how I died. This is how I died, but
*  You see me. I was trying to get him. I was trying to kill him
*  I knew cuz for me if I'm ready to die, I'm ready to kill you have to be willing to give something up as well
*  So in that fifth round when I was throwing those shots when I was I think I dropped him like four times or something crazy
*  Like even the last one like went from heaven to hit him
*  I wished I didn't like follow and like roll over on them cuz I probably could have got him out with like two seconds left
*  But I was trying to get him out of there then and it's sad to say but I was ready if he had taken it
*  To me and he if he had done that to me and I didn't wake up
*  So be it
*  Well, that was evident in the way you fought because you did you didn't you know?
*  It was a close fight, but it looked like you were ahead on the judges, but you didn't take I mean any
*  Break at all you you just you threw yourself into the fire instead of being cautious, you know
*  And I told that to Dana, you know Dana and I were talking about that fight and he was he was talking about how hyped
*  He is for Whitaker. They tried to get me to fly to Australia
*  I love you, bro
*  It would be tried like right now I've canceled a lot of my trips cuz it's awesome
*  You know my knee but also just formal being away from the gym like you feel it after a while
*  Yeah, this level like after the fight because you can see the target on your back people smiling your face, you know
*  Oh, yeah, and then yeah, I know what's up. I'm not stupid
*  I've seen a lot of people in this game rise and fall 100% all the time
*  So I want to get back to doing what I do best Dana and I have these conversations
*  Sometimes we get hyped up and talk on the phone and we were talking about that fight and I said
*  Do you know what he said you literally said it? Yeah, I have it on my arm as a highlight
*  I made by myself and then I had it in the captions and I was like, you know, you know, you're gonna beat me
*  I'm ready to die. I'm prepared to die
*  That's a movie type shit that is movie type shit, especially when you win
*  Yeah, I don't know and Dana just went holy shit. I said to watch it. Just watch it again. He's saying I'm out that yeah
*  That was a hell of a fight man, there's a hell of a fight
*  Yeah, I don't want to have much much like those but you have to get that cuz after that fight even like probably about two
*  Minutes after I was like I can go another two rounds. I felt it. I was like, this is like the third wind Wow
*  Shit and I'm not just saying this like gas you up. I'm saying like I was like I
*  Can go another two rounds and you can see it like I felt fresh man
*  I've never this is my I was my second fifth five round fight when I fought this time last year against them
*  What's his name on July last year Brats of ours?
*  Fifth round I was just having fun
*  I didn't even like I wouldn't say I took my foot off the pedal
*  But I was having fun with it and this fight like I said, you know fifth round
*  I was ready and I said that for the Romero fight and what's his name with a graphite?
*  Look look how he looked in the fifth round. He's got gas. Don't get me wrong
*  He can be can crack something or Romero but Romero and him they don't have the same kind of
*  Spice as I do when I'm in when I'm in the trenches when it's time to go I can go cuz I do it in
*  The gym every day you wanted Romero for your next fight
*  Sometimes man, I'm a charitable guy, you know, I mean he's coming off three out of four losses three in a row
*  So I'm like, yeah, but all of those could have been his yeah
*  I know but and also the people the people the casuals they think this is the guy
*  Well first well, I think Brunson was the guy and then Gaslim was a guy
*  Yeah, and then would it cuz the guy so they think this is the guy to beat me. So I'm like, alright
*  This is my charity work for the year
*  Well, he's an interesting fight for anybody. Yeah, 100% because he's a freak athlete
*  I mean that you look up freak in the dictionary
*  You see a picture yo, El Romero flying through the air hitting Chris. Why do you know? Yeah, I mean, he's just a freak
*  I remember his first fight. I saw him. He did the same thing to the black guy bald black guy
*  Flying me boom and just kind of starstruck them just ran at him. But
*  Is his level this is what this is what rises me to the occasion?
*  This is what challenges me because a guy like that, like you say, he's a beast same thing with Robert
*  He's a beast. Yeah, but these levels to this and if you can make that look easy. It just makes you look that like your status
*  Legendary go all that shit. That's what you want. Yeah, so you want
*  Good, you know I'm saying but it's all about the challenges taking out Robert Whitaker in the second round in his home country
*  You know doing that to your Romero maybe not in Cuba
*  I don't know what the situation is like there but like in Vegas in a big arena T T mobile arena
*  That would be fucking dope. Yeah, but the Dana said, you know, he's got to get a win first there
*  Thing is they don't know how to sell it like to the people and I'm like, fuck it
*  Anyway, and I've said and even his manager at the fights for whatever reason while I was walking was like Israel
*  We signed the country. I was like, I didn't know who it was. He's like, hey, we signed the contract. Just tell Dana
*  I was like, okay
*  Have my drink in my hand like cool story, bro. We signed the car. What the fuck is that Dana said?
*  There's no no, but he was trying to say nice to hype and then like right someone might
*  They sent me this other video of him in the gym saying Israel. Why are you backing now?
*  Why are you backing up? You know, just tell Dana the fucking day. I'm like
*  You you don't know you can love me only one
*  But I'm saying like I want to do the fight I said look this is the guy right this is the guy
*  He's gonna take me down and beat the fuck out of me. Okay
*  No one's been able to do that yet. So let's see if this guy can do it or let's see if I can take him down
*  Well, yeah, the thing is to you have to get him now because he's 41 now, I think 40 41. He's old
*  Yeah, and that's what they're gonna say. Oh, yeah, you beat up. Yeah
*  He's still a beast. I can tell people as well when he fought Robert Whitaker. They didn't have that narrative
*  No, they didn't say beat Whitaker. I think the second time he beat. Yeah, I said you dropped him
*  Yeah, he heard of that and if you look at those ten eight rules, you know, the the new new rules he won
*  Yeah, if you look at you you judge about a new judging system. Yeah, I thought he won period
*  I just thought he won. Yeah, I mean and Whitaker's a fucking animal man
*  He hung in there with that guy blasting him on the chin, but he heard him and he heard him bad
*  several times but
*  The Polo Costa fight might get my guy
*  My favorite friend leaving la vida costa, let's go I felt like that that fight was a legit either one could have got that
*  I think I agreed with it when Costa won. I'm said, okay, I could see that but if they gave it to Romero
*  I would be like why I could see that too
*  Like I say just stole it just stole
*  Yeah
*  I think that's the way to look at it just so the draw when he dropped him in the first round that really
*  Solidified it and Romero was trying his best to come back but
*  Just a step behind in my eyes. Anyway, like I said if they roll the dice sometimes
*  What the thing is shocking about Romero is how well he takes a shot?
*  There's a picture of Costa kicking him in the head that I put on Instagram where it looks like his soul is leaving his body
*  Like his eyes are rolling back in his head. That's Shannon's wrapping around his head. His whole head is distorted
*  I think it's the trance flinch. It's all those tracks
*  Just holds his head in place holds his brain place right there
*  Well, you know, he had a pretty severe neck injury if you look at the back of his neck
*  He's got a giant scar up his neck. Oh, yeah, his discs fused. Look at that picture
*  Disgusting his face into the fucking black hole of another universe
*  Yeah, I mean that is full impact. That's
*  The hip on that. Yes, it's all in Robert did one on him as well. But this is a lot cleaner
*  Yeah, I'm nicer god damn I mean he's he's taking giant shots
*  I think Brunson hit him with a high head kick as well wrapped around the neck. Nothing. I
*  Think his neck is like one solid piece
*  Yeah, just go right I was the fuck they did in Cuba to his neck when they did that operation on it
*  He's all fused up and he won't cut his teeth
*  I've seen him around. He's especially when he's not cutting away like he's tight. He's heavy boring. He's huge. What?
*  He's you know, he can move for 43. He can move. He's real flexible
*  I've seen very flexible him doing the splits. Yeah doing that dance on one clip the Cuban Olympic program is no joke
*  I mean that when he described it he came on with Joey Diaz
*  And you I saw this if it yeah bits of it
*  It was amazing because Joey was translating from Cuban to English and they were talking about the program
*  like they just train them and
*  They put them in this situation where if you win you get more food
*  Yeah, and you get a better place to stay and if you lose you get two meals a day if you lose you get three meals
*  If you win and these guys are they're competing against the best in the world. Yeah, and it's just every day is battle battle
*  You know, he's like everybody I with wants to kill me and you become a machine
*  It's like, you know, you see the dude first of all when you sit across from you like okay with you
*  I know you're heavier than 185 pounds, but it's feasible
*  What do you like? What do you walk around it like right now? I guess 203
*  Yes feasible yo, well looks like America man America you got to realize man the food. Oh my god
*  Like I forget every time you got to order small cuz you order naturals like large they come in in the platter
*  Yeah, people like to get fat. Yeah
*  We like everything metabolism for me. You're lucky. Yeah, we like everything big over here everything outrageous
*  outrageous country
*  Hey
*  Well, you were saying even drinks they pour bigger drinks over yeah like I'm surprised like it's I think it's part of the culture
*  As well, like you order you say a double they're like no it comes in a double. I'm like, oh
*  Double double and then literally you have to ask for more coke or more fans or whatever. Yeah. Yeah ice helps them in
*  Do you like New Zealand?
*  Like there was a time from I think it was on going into the New Year's of 2011
*  I was driving down from Auckland to Wonga Nui and I was just going through by myself in my old car Chewie
*  Rapping singing just having fun and I was just looking at the landscape and that was the moment
*  I decided that this is where I'm gonna stay
*  This is the country I'm gonna live in cuz I always had this idea that I'm gonna go to Canada or America eventually
*  But also cuz my Jim's over there my team's over there Eugene's over there my family. I've made friends. They I've grown up
*  There's my it's my other country, you know, so I love it over there. I love the vibe as well
*  It's a beautiful you haven't been I saw Chad Mendes went through and got a big red
*  Yeah, you go out there. You can catch something man. Like that's like a 13-point. I counted before
*  Yeah, you can get some shit. Yeah, they have giant stags. Oh, I just imagine like that with something that's 800 pounds behind it
*  Yeah, what is that thousand pounds something? Yeah, that one that I have out in the front was over a thousand pounds
*  Yeah, the one you walk in. Yeah, it's huge. I've seen some next to cars as well on YouTube
*  Just get some perspective yeah
*  See I told you the story this maid
*  Yeah, what was the place Costco? I asked her gonna go to Utah not Utah
*  I was gonna go on to Alex Bokanofsky's fight
*  So I asked her where can I go get a chili bin and I went to Costco while they were cleaning out the Airbnb
*  And I also had some Nigerian food. I ordered as well from Texas. So when I got back
*  Racks everything and I was like fuck and then you text me how to cook it and everything and my coach Eugene cuz I really
*  Wanted to she's a hunter avid hunter like after fights first place
*  He goes in the bush because he wants to get away from all this
*  So I was like I gotta share this with him. Yeah, they were asked it man. I'm sure they kept it
*  They threw it in the bin. I'm sure they kept it, but I hope they enjoyed it
*  Yeah, yeah, but I gotta try some milk one day. Definitely. I will anytime man anytime you're running here
*  We want to set up a kitchen in here in the studio. This is like the new fantasy factory
*  You know, but actually you walk around I'm like man. I need one of these you do one day
*  Yeah, I have a gym and right next to the gym a funhouse yeah
*  It's it's good to have everything where I could do it all in one place to me. I just don't have any time
*  Yeah, so you need everything right? Yeah, it helps
*  I can come in here two hours before show get a full workout in shower everything even sauna
*  Nice, you know get it all done in one spot. If you got a kitchen definitely I could have made me a sandwich
*  Yeah, we got a little baby kitchen, but we got it. We got to set up a grill in here
*  Um what I was getting about New Zealand is the beauty man
*  Like there's something I think that like when people think about places and places to live, you know, I think oh it's convenient
*  This is an easy commute. This is you know, it's a nice apartment or it's a nice house, whatever it is
*  But there's something about natural beauty and it doesn't really get much beautiful more beautiful
*  The New Zealand in the South Island as well like the North Island school is some spots
*  There's a lot of places like for me I travel all around the world
*  But whenever like I fly in and I see the Sky Tower and you can see the grant like the landscape of the place
*  It's beautiful and I feel like like Marshall when he sees the hills and he's about to go for a hike
*  I'm just like yes almost home. I was home but like it's such a beautiful place
*  And we Queen's Queen's Queen's Queen sound the South Island the snow there. I haven't been I've seen everyone posting about it
*  But one day I'm gonna go this snow in New Zealand. Fuck. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, my little pehu
*  That's where I've been snowing snowboarding years ago South Island
*  I've been to years ago when I was younger like 12, but definitely as an adult
*  I gotta go it's different when you go with your parents and when you're going as adults
*  So I gotta go out there man. It's fucking beautiful
*  It's a crazy place when it comes to wildlife because they brought it all from Europe
*  Yeah, they did even like I'm surprised in Auckland is an island called. Why Hickey Island?
*  it's some probably about a 20-minute ferry ride from the city and
*  There's wallabies on there. I had no idea and apparently they're a
*  Invasive species because the guy brought them from Australia, but then luckily they kept on the island now
*  But I've heard rumors now they've kind of found their way because you know some crazy fucks. I'm gonna keep this course
*  On the way to like Rotorua the redwoods and all that kind of shit. It's always some crazy fuck that wants a pet
*  I know
*  Florida's got a giant problem with that. Yeah with that was it anacondas
*  Con does he call it a what's that guy Tarzan guy? He catches them all the time
*  Iguanas iguanas as well. There's a lot of them and they're killing them now. They're calling them
*  They give you money if you kill iguanas really yeah, cuz they're digging under houses. Oh, they dig tunnels
*  I didn't really dig I thought they were some trees. I thought so too. Yeah, you learn something new every day
*  They have so many pythons there. They said there's no more rabbits. There's no more marsh hairs
*  Raccoons deer everything's gone all pythons pythons are eating alligators. Yeah. Oh, yeah, I've seen
*  They see them and they burst out and I see the legs sticking out and shit like that even found Nile
*  crocodiles in the Everglades really
*  Full so that's all product crocodile. Yeah, they have a kill on sight warning for isn't it like the even it was a Texas they have more
*  Tigers. Yep, a lion. Yeah, that was my Netflix special. Yeah, that's right
*  I guess in Texas somewhere then all of the wild of the world crazy. Yeah
*  Fuck
*  So crazy
*  Spend much time out there. I've been there when I first went there was when I think when I first met you UFC 192
*  DC Gustafson. Hmm. Yeah, I was there. It was a good time. I didn't really I just ate that's all I did
*  They're just eating barbeque. Yeah, barbeque. Damn was cutting away. This is when he was a featherweight
*  Yeah
*  That guy ever made featherweight he like I asked him how you feeling he's I feel great I'm like, yeah you feel great
*  I was hooked
*  Lightweight you see him at lightweight now. I'm telling you he's the one he could say I've seen some things man
*  I he's a tough guy. I've had him on my back for four minutes
*  Over five minute around sparring and he's hard to get off and he's good like
*  You know some people in the gym they shine and some people under the bright lights
*  They shine some people can do both and I'm telling you. Yeah, he's he's the one like people don't know yet
*  There's some things he hasn't shown of his game that I'm
*  I'm sure that like so I was in the room when DC and John Anik were doing like the you know, the fighter room
*  What do you call it interview?
*  So I did my one first and then they did Dan and Dan was telling me like John asked about the champ
*  You know, so that is a you know, how would you be could be and he said he just saw DC go
*  Like
*  Lean in like what and then he had to kind of just you know, say some bullshit whatever
*  But yeah, like I know because even like DC asked me to help me help him train for the Jones fight
*  the second one and I turned it down because
*  They had rock holding their camp and I wasn't in the UFC at the time
*  But I knew I don't want to give them anything right? I don't want to give them anything
*  I don't want them to say all he came to our camp like I did with black zillions and then they say oh
*  You know we see holes in this game right which is all bullshit
*  Yeah, I just you just don't want the chat I don't want anything I want nothing I don't give him nothing
*  Yeah, yeah, cuz I always knew this was coming. So I was like a planet plot your way
*  But you and I talked on Instagram years and 14. Yeah. Yeah, and we're times like
*  Yeah, but hey, I said give me my time. Let me work. Yeah, I've been working man. I'll be working
*  Well, I pay attention attention dudes who shine. Thank you sir outside, you know, I know guys who are coming
*  You know, I know guys are coming up
*  But I knew you had been thinking about MMA and I had been a fan of you as a kickboxer
*  Yeah, I've been working about it
*  Well, I'm always fascinated by elite specialists that make their way in MMA because I'm always like well
*  How's this gonna translate is it I think that it seems harder
*  It seems harder for a lot of grapplers who don't have a background striking
*  I mean, I think grappling can be the most important thing in MMA because if you can't
*  Stop a guy from taking you down. You're gonna lose but
*  You have to start every fight on your feet
*  And when you see a guy who doesn't have good striking fight a guy who has elite striking like a good example this past weekend
*  Was Kevin Lee versus Gregor Gillespie? Yeah, Gregor Gillespie is a fucking fantastic wrestler elite wrestler and
*  Kevin Lee's a better striker and you see that every fights and Kevin Lee has a wrestling background, too
*  So it's no picnic taking that guy down
*  But you see when a guy's a better striker has more weapons and then Gregor gets high-kicked
*  It's a different kind of feel and also one thing
*  Eugene and Andre my arresting coach that alluded to is people forget the takedowns the wrestling starts way before the clinch
*  Starts way before you get taken down away before you engage. It's all about positioning
*  Foot positioning it's all about distance control
*  So once you have that and you understand the the principles of that your wrestling becomes easy
*  Like I might have I don't know if it's the highest takedown
*  Defense percentage in the UFC's middle
*  Yeah, good as I it's high but and there's I mean the only time was in my second fight when the guy
*  In the third round I didn't break the grip and he sucked my leg in immediately after because I normally room with Andre
*  He just kind of told me what to do. Okay ever since that in training
*  No one ever gets that on me or really really gets that on me. So I'm always improving man
*  Like I said even right now FOMO
*  Like fair of missing out because I see everyone
*  Fair of missing out. That's what the kids are saying. I know the kids
*  It's fair of missing out so like oh my I see like on the group chat what the team's doing and I see them working
*  The 10 a.m. Score shot to the table squad where they at a
*  Percent especially like
*  Just the young guys coming up, you know, I see it and I'm not stupid man. I know the targets on my back
*  It's easy to get this but it's hard to keep it. So
*  Yeah, I want to make sure I'm I want to do what Demetrius did
*  I want to do what Silva did, you know
*  I want to be one of those guys who just racks it up get all the infinity stones
*  All the gems now what happens if they over run the outside of the game with gems
*  I mean you build a new belt. They used to give you a new belt every time
*  I know I'm putting these ones all the gems on these bits guys like steep a steep a has a shitload of belt
*  Yeah, what have been cool? I was looking for to that. I might I'm sure I can buy some of them
*  I talked to some of them. Yeah. Yeah, it's what you think about the BMF belt
*  Yeah, it's a touchy subject. I felt like I well I like the idea, you know, the fact that an idea is, you know
*  He ain't no West Coast gangster, you know, and then yeah, you know from Miami, you know, whatever
*  They should have kept that between them the company didn't have to get involved
*  he didn't have to get involved to like
*  try and solidify this but what it was was they needed a
*  Title for the MSG card cuz Colby and Osman and what happened but look at this Misha Tate versus Holly home
*  Was the co-main event as a title fight for Diaz?
*  McGregor won right so you don't that fight itself would have been fine without the belt without the rock with all that kind of
*  Stuff, but it happened and yeah, it's cool. What's gonna happen now. Is he gonna defend it?
*  Cuz even the ego in me is like
*  But like there's no point cuz are they gonna defend the belt are they gonna I don't know yeah
*  Well, I feel like Mazda dollars championship cow
*  I might put some fucking spinners on this now and then do like John Cena to call this the freestyle belt
*  You know, like yeah, I you know, I see where you're saying but I feel like Mazda dollars world champion
*  Okay, 100% 100% I've been a fan of that guy since way back
*  Everyone's just finding out now all these guys are all Street Jesus. I'm like, well, I'm not a hipster
*  Before he was cool, man, you know, I'm gonna be that guy but I like his resurrection
*  I like the fact that he rebranded himself because you have to do that. I see the movies
*  I see actors do it entertainment you rebrand yourself new package and then boom
*  I'm also what happened with him. He said he went away. He did this reality show. Yeah, so I watched it
*  But he said he went away and had time to himself smart man
*  Yeah
*  Well, what happened was he was on this reality show and Dan Lambert said it was terrible terrible experiences by himself all day
*  No phone. He had to go into the village to get food. There's no fucking food like Rose Island
*  I forget somewhere in South America
*  but the the experience was it was several months and it was a disaster and he didn't like it at all and and then it
*  forced him to think about where he's at where it could be and
*  One of the things he was saying is like all these split decisions and he was thinking like why you know
*  Why did it go that way instead of the other way?
*  Like why did I lose that fight instead of win it because there was a lot of them that are really close
*  And he was thinking maybe I could just have done a little bit more and won that fight and then he said
*  Why am I thinking like a fucking peasant?
*  he goes why don't I just knock that motherfucker out and then and so that shift in his mentality change and then all
*  Suddenly Merck's Donald Cerrone Merck's Darren till Merck's Ben Askren beats the fuck out of Nate Diaz
*  Like he's a different person now and now he's what he could have been. Yeah, he is potential realized like he's a rebirth
*  He's at a hundred percent. He's at a hundred percent
*  You get in the cage with that guy. He's even thinking about boxing with Canelo. Yes, I'm a crazy
*  I mean his thought is like hey man, I can do more than Conor McGregor did and I'm not gonna fade
*  Yeah, yeah, you can and I think cuz I watched the fight again
*  It's different when you watch it live when I was watching it live
*  I saw Diaz coming back and he was in the third round and I was swinging towards Diaz like oh
*  Maybe he won that round but I watched it back and I'm like, he had all three
*  Yeah, and Diaz was like I said, he was coming back but if I on the scorecards
*  Yeah, I think he really had it and a couple of those rounds you could make an argument for 10-8
*  Yeah, he beat the fuck out of Diaz
*  I think he hit him in the gut and Diaz tactical move vent move just dropped down
*  Mm-hmm just dropped down says I come with my god cuz yeah, he probably got hurt to the body
*  Yeah, I heard one of them
*  That right right body kick. Ah, it's look why Diaz try to block it on and he just went right underneath
*  Yeah, and the thing I hate as well inspiring is when you kick the elbow you ever tried that?
*  Yeah, I broke my foot doing that. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Fuck my foot. I cracked it
*  Tip of the elbow so hard and the top of your foot is so soft takes a real skill like Durant
*  Oh has it as well where they can sneak it underneath. Yeah, is it is a different angle Eugene taught me how to do it?
*  So yeah, I love it. I love it's one of my moves
*  I hit him to virus with it as well before I swept him. Yeah, you have to learn how to sweep just right underneath
*  You got your eye on till now still now
*  You know like I saw him last year but on the press conference leading up to the Bronson fight
*  I even said look I can't wait till we do it man
*  I know one day will clash and it's just cuz of the styles. Yeah, like styles make fights
*  Yeah, you know and he's got a style that I like very basic, but when I say basic
*  I don't mean that would do respect would disrespect right I say he's got strong basics. He's a stout. He's a southpaw
*  He's a nice straight left nice body kick curves the left
*  He knows how to change it up and on the clinch as well when he gets close
*  I like what he did with them Gastelum. Yeah, he played the distance game. Well, you know, I learned it in the third round
*  I kind of learned it in the fight, but Gastelum was doing something
*  What did you do? What happened in the third round?
*  No, in the third round I knew where his like right after the fight me and Eugene was if I were like fuck
*  That's what he did. That's how we got so close and we knew already
*  But it was hard to call it in the fight because we were too focused on other things
*  but I think automatically through muscle memory I was able to
*  Take that distance away from him in the fight from the third round
*  But for first I think for the first round and some of the second round he was able to like use it's a little hop
*  Step everyone knows it now. It's a little house that he'd jab me jab me put it in my face
*  It's like a little to do so you're calculating his movement. Yeah, I'm not doing it this way
*  I'm doing it like internal muscle memory, right memory
*  It's your memory of fights and sparring and knowing what you can do versus knowing what you see him doing
*  Yeah, and just like it's like a dance. So that's super hard to explain to people
*  I you look at a guy and you're like listen to me that guy's gonna fuck that guy up and people go what are you talking
*  About my don't listen to me that guy's gonna like when Anderson Silva first fought Chris Liebman
*  Yeah, I remember the odds were like real close and I pulled a friend of mine aside. I said bet the house
*  Bet the house on Anderson. He goes are you serious? I go bet the house. I go bet the house
*  Yeah, I go this guy's an assassin. This is a different thing. You've seen a different thing. I'm telling you
*  This is of this is one of the rare
*  The fucking sky has to fall for him to lose no one knew that's the thing
*  No one knew who he was until that happened
*  I'd watch all those cave warriors fight when he was standing in front of Jorge Rivera and let him punch him in the face
*  He just rolling with this rolling with it. Well people don't understand this like and they said ah
*  fucking casuals
*  Like a lot of experts as well have casual brains cuz they're like
*  Israel has no knockout power cuz he hit Henderson silver in the face clean
*  I'm like, you don't understand this Anderson is playing the game where me and him are playing this game
*  So when I hit him, I didn't hit him clean. I'm not trying to hit him where he is
*  I'm trying to hit him where he's gonna be. Hmm, but then he knows that as well
*  So he'd anticipate that and then pause
*  The distance is just right. So it just nicks him
*  There's a time I kicked him in the face and I slowed it down on my Instagram
*  Just one and just like my toe literally you see my toes and ugly as fuck
*  Like
*  And we're playing this game but I literally I was trying to hit him where he's gonna be but then he paused and then the punch
*  Would just do so it looked cool. Yeah, I was like I didn't hit him clean, right?
*  I'd like he just we're playing this game and people don't understand people who've never fought
*  They don't understand that game you're playing. Yeah, it was beautiful man. I love that fight
*  I was like, that was iconic man. That was a I wish she had left after that fight man
*  Cuz I wanted to be the one the people are silly
*  That was a great fight. Yeah, but this is people that don't have an appreciation for movement and like what it takes
*  What it takes people don't know shit about MMA. No, most people don't know shit about everything exactly
*  Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of people out there that are experts
*  Don't know shit about what they're talking about. Yeah, the thing about Anderson and you is god damn
*  I would have loved to see that fight when Anderson was 10 years younger. Yeah, you are at warrior out right now
*  I'll tell you how it goes. How's it go?
*  Same way it went. You know what? Why he's never had someone do to him what he's done to people
*  Because what I was doing to him making him jump making him do whenever he did this
*  Mm-hmm. That's all for Gazy. That's all
*  He is I
*  I've used it a few times. Yeah, you know what means it's an interesting term
*  it was there was a limousine company in New York and they started writing bad checks and
*  So the those checks became for Gazy checks. It's fake. So when someone yeah
*  Yeah, it was it was a limousine company called for Gazy limousine. Oh
*  So it's not a real word now. Well, it is it became an expression
*  Oh, it just became an expression for Gazy. Yeah, so this company started writing bad checks. So anytime that something's fake, it's for Gazy
*  Yeah, there's something new every day like promo. Yeah
*  But like yeah, so whatever I'd like faint him or make him jump or make him react, you know
*  Like I got you hit like right trapping hands kung fu 52 blocks, right?
*  But it was there's no he didn't he went through his career fighting really good fighters great fighters, but never an elite kickboxer
*  Yeah, never an elite world-class kickboxer like a world championship caliber fighter like yourself
*  Not well not a kickboxer but definitely some like you said good fighters, but
*  The guys all the guys that he beat of their error. They couldn't last in this era
*  It's a different time now. The game has changed the game keeps evolving and it like
*  How do I say it's not disrespect but it's just it's it's if you had me and my prime right now
*  Well, I'm leaving in my prime kind of in it. How will you know 20?
*  Do 30 I try
*  Likewise likewise likewise, but um, yeah, it's just pretty much the game of inches a game of fake a game of ha gotcha
*  And I do that better than him. Yeah, I feel that and dude. This is the guy I've loved and I've you know, I'm fucking
*  Gagging and jizz about him the whole fucking career like he's a fucking I use wrong words. Yeah
*  I
*  Know you're literally like I've fanboyed over the guy his whole career and I've studied him
*  I knew what he was gonna do before he do it. Like when he tripped me, I was getting up in my head
*  I was like, okay, here come that flying knee and then whoop I did like literally I pressed eject
*  I was like get the fuck out of dodge straight away
*  Honestly, I was like I'm not and then he's he's up the case like at one point even I hit him with a tummy
*  I had him in the tummy and he touched me in the coming and I was like, he goes let me try I was like no
*  We really catch that or even when I at one point as well when he put his hands down and not like we're playing
*  That game in this way. I
*  Went stop doing that. I threw my hands up. I stopped doing that
*  There's no one on this fucking planet if you put your hands down and chin up that I'll tell you stop doing that
*  But no hands down chin up keep doing that but whatever reason I
*  Said stop doing that
*  That's why that's a question I have to answer like after I retire and see because people are like, oh did you hold back on?
*  And I said, I'm like fuck no, I was I rocked him in the first round and if I had dead in him
*  I was trying to I was trying to win but yeah, I
*  Still have love for the guy and I respect the guy. He might not feel the same but he's some he's a guy
*  Yeah, and he told me like in the get like he beat let me know what to do
*  He told me like I said, don't lose focus and that's why even right now like I said formal. I'm like
*  You know all this shit is cool. There's victory tour, you know, rating this shit around. It's nice, but I
*  Want to work? Yeah
*  Makes champion on a percent man was it weird being across the cage from him knowing him only one more one moment
*  There's one moment and it was in a third round and he went to the he's like, come on
*  It puts his back against the fence is what he did to Bisping. Mm-hmm a front kicked him in the face
*  And then like kind of sat there and at one point I was just stood out
*  I'm gonna wait to and it was maybe like seven seconds, but there's a split second in there that I was like
*  Holy shit
*  I'm fighting innocent silver
*  My time nice right here then he came to the center of the cage and then we kept it going but
*  Done fighting
*  It's for moments like this fuck the belt it's iconic moments that you know, like Ali over Sonny Liston
*  Yeah, I got that at home framed signed by Muhammad Ali Wow
*  Yeah shit like that outside this for someone sometime and then it's gonna be framed
*  Oh, honestly, it's so beautiful man. And this is rock Lee even something like this something some synchronicities that happen
*  So this is from this anime the first fight I watched in this King Google this pull it up, Jamie
*  What is it rock Lee versus Gaara
*  Gaara this is episode 46 of Naruto and it was the first fight I ever watched that got me into the series and
*  What is this anime series Naruto? I've only seen it online. It takes too long. It's a 720 episode fucking yeah
*  720 episodes. Yeah, so this bit right here. He takes the weights off
*  He takes the weight off or you can watch the highlights and then literally there's some heavy ass weights, but he fucks up Gaara
*  but I did the stance rock Lee normally does I did the stance that he normally does in the Wayans and
*  Anderson stood there like Gaara, but he probably doesn't even know
*  What that is, but he just stood there like this and shit like that
*  It's a tied you to fight. It's just like when life imitates art without even trying you know what I mean?
*  Yeah, I edited it. I've got some guys, you know shot to cut craft and black print effects
*  They edited it for me to make it look the same as this but literally
*  Yeah shit like this jazzes me up man. I'm geeking out right now fucking nerd
*  shot to John Jones I
*  Do you call you nerd? Yeah, I know
*  my feelings
*  Nerd is not negative man, of course
*  Nunchuck skills bo-hunting skills all that there's nothing wrong with being a nerd man. I mean nerds run the world fuck you
*  Yeah
*  Telling kids man like don't peek in high school man, especially the nerds. I told them I've spoken to some some schools now
*  I just tell them like look and
*  New Zealand's got the highest you suicide rate in the world and it's cuz a lot of these kids
*  Literally, yeah
*  They think they think this is gonna be forever like whatever they're feeling that depression being believed me fucked with and it's different now because of
*  All this shit. Yeah, like Scott, you know in depression what not social media people attacking you and I just tell them like look
*  It's gonna be fine. This isn't forever at the end of the day. They will peak now like when I go back
*  To where I grew up in rural when I see some of the kids they used to fuck with me
*  I'm like, I'm scared of you
*  Right, I literally even when I close my eyes now cuz I was I had a late growth spurt
*  I can see them I visualize them and they still see them as bigger than me
*  but when I go back they're like
*  Short and dumpy and got like five different kids to three different baby mamas and working at the same job for the last 12
*  years and I'm just like
*  Man, you were in the first 15 rugby team. You were the man. I thought you was the man
*  But now I'm the man but I never feel any kind of way over
*  I don't feel only two of them ever apologize, but I don't feel like cuz I'm petty, you know
*  I got chips and dips on my shoulder
*  I'm that guy but I don't feel the type of way where I have to like
*  Shoot on them cuz I understand kids are cruel kids are dumb and I see it this day and age
*  I see it like they don't even know what they're doing while they're doing it
*  They just fucking angry little chimps hormones and they don't know what's happening. I know
*  I should I would have told myself don't think with your penis. That's the best advice
*  I give young man. No one tells him that no one jerk off first then think about it. That's what I know
*  What's this? No, not November bullshit. That's nonsense. What that's a good way to my lost on the first day mistakes
*  three times
*  God I'm buzzing man. Exactly all that tantric shit. Let it go. Let it go keep it inside their body. That's nonsense
*  Cuz then it's a's jizz
*  Like if you know if you haven't just after a while when you just look at it. Yeah, it's like whiskey. Yeah
*  I
*  Am not gonna drink this. I know I feel bad about drinking it now. Sorry. Yeah, what is that? No nut November get out of here
*  That's a good way to stay confused. Yeah, you're gonna make a lot of bad choices that yes
*  Yeah, how many times have guys made bad choices? I was trying to explain this to a woman
*  She was saying that men are assholes and they pretend to be someone so just so they could fuck a girl and then after they
*  Fuck girl, then you see who they really are. I go. Listen, they don't even know who the fuck they are
*  When a guy's telling you they're in love with you
*  They mean that in that moment and then they come and then they're like, oh what what did I do?
*  I gotta get out of here. Yeah, like they're not it's not that they're being deceptive to you. They're being deceived as well
*  Yeah, I had a whole bit about it that when you have a bone right it that your bit
*  You are like in the back seat of a very long bus
*  There's another dude driving the bus like where the fuck is he going? Like what?
*  Yeah, you're watching your life take place through a windshield 50 feet away from you that's what it's like for men
*  I don't do it. Yeah, if you come you jerk off first and you go out with a girl if you really enjoy
*  November yeah, wait who won this thing by the way the sober October? I didn't have a championship this year
*  We've all we did just for friends. Yeah, we just had a thing
*  We had to do ten classes and read 500 pages of any books. Okay, we just decided that's cool
*  See that's something you can get behind. Yeah last year was too crazy. Yeah
*  Between Tommy and no more machine. Yeah. Yeah, it was doing some crazy shit to try and lose the weight
*  Yeah, they were all trying to lose weight Bert
*  I told him if he gets down to a five you could have the sober October belt
*  But what's he right now?
*  Oh
*  Lose the weight the belt
*  I'm gonna go I go slow word about 235
*  I go to this guys who fight in the 205 pound division that way 235 on Tuesday
*  And they fight on Saturday and they wait they weigh in on Friday at 205
*  Oh, you can do it you can do it, but you know this work on a Bert Bert's gonna Bert. Yeah, it's a discipline issue
*  So
*  He's coming to New Zealand as well he's already is he the birdie boy tour, yeah
*  Yeah, machine to get I need to get a gig out there. I need to do my man
*  Tonyangelo said if you want to come through he can suss it out. Okay. Yeah, he's looking forward to it
*  But he said like get in contact with him. I was like, I know well
*  I'm gonna do it up now do a gig and then take a few days and go hunting bro
*  You'd love it man. Even if you take your kids and just like there's a lodge out there. Yeah, it's really expensive
*  I'm sure for you. They'll they'll cut you out. Okay. Yeah easy. Yeah, that's nice spot
*  and they'll take you to one of these ranches where
*  You know you can get you either like my advice go with Eugene
*  I won't even come like go Eugene
*  He knows like some shit and he knows the skills as well
*  Or you can go to these ranches where they have it for you where you can get one of those like a big red
*  Yeah
*  My first time I shot one dead was a big red and I remember like for downwind we tracked it took ages
*  And you surprised how the guy who owns the land old man, but he was fucking kicking our ass man
*  Like me, but he's just like a mountain goat just tracking tracking. They get used to hiking. It's nothing to it every day
*  Yeah, and then I get there and then we like takes about maybe ten minutes cuz they're all there in the herd
*  Yeah easting and then we like flanked it properly. We're not was a downwind. We're upwind away from it. That's the one
*  Well, you want to be downwind so downwind is coming to you. Yeah, so they can smell us. Yeah
*  Yeah, and then I remember like hit it boom right there you hit it with a rifle. Yeah, right?
*  Yeah, yeah, I don't know how to use a bow yet. Yeah, but then yeah. Yeah
*  Yeah, Cameron said he wanted me. Yeah. Yeah, you said boy. I'll wait in time in time anytime. I want to fight first
*  I'll arrange that oh man, but then she dropped right there there and dead and then I went up there and me and my boy
*  Rod as well my tattooist he shows me how to like section it up
*  And then there's a slinky in there like that's we call that on the baby so you take that out slinky
*  Yeah, it's like the baby that the infant that's in there. Oh, you've shot a female. Yeah female
*  Yeah, so she dropped there right literally. Yeah right there. I think they call the slinky cuz of the way it moves
*  I'm assuming so yeah
*  So you dispose of that cuz the pig is gonna eat it
*  It's gonna go back to the earth all that kind of stuff
*  That was the first day and that was my big red and the next day
*  We're going we're on the fucking what do you call the ATV?
*  And then I don't know where we see two fellows the smaller ones and they're up on the ridge and then my coach Doug
*  Doug viney is a k1 champion as well from Vegas right now
*  And then I shot it and I didn't hit this one is clean so then like we have to trek all the way up
*  Tawn like you know all this kind of shit. What do you call them on stinger needle?
*  Yeah, you're gonna knowing and then get up to it. You see it trying to like
*  The vegan is gonna hate me for this
*  But then I was like oh shit, okay, and then you gotta finish it off
*  Yeah, I have to you know do the right thing so I get the rifle right. I'm there. I'm looking at it and then
*  And then Doug's like
*  This is about after about 30 seconds. You all right. I was like yeah hold up just have to
*  Was like you're not scared. I am like nah, but then I realized the shits fucking two feet in front of me
*  I'm using the scope. Oh
*  Yeah
*  Yeah, and that was it she was done you couldn't find and then yeah weird yeah too close
*  You're all fucked up like a brain fart moment cuz I was just used to using the scope
*  So I'm like I had a fuck you using the scope when the things right there in front of you
*  So I just hit it boom point-blank dead. I had to do the same thing in the first era shot stop suffering
*  Yeah, but then one thing I really enjoyed was afterwards when you have to section it right there
*  And this is the thing man if you can't
*  My personal philosophy is if you can't hunt if you can't kill what you eat don't eat meat don't touch it
*  Because you don't understand where it comes from and eventually one day kind of like you what you have now you have your own operation
*  I want to have my own operation. I want to have my own like
*  Land my own property where I can just like bang bang bang. Yeah, he's a stock it up right pigs
*  Organic yeah, and it's different man. It's a lot different especially when you have to section it yourself
*  This fallow I section myself the big one
*  I gave to my butcher friend to make like garlic sausages and salami all that kind of stuff beautiful
*  and then
*  Yeah, Rod taught me how to section the you know what you use your hands wet
*  You put it through the skin and acts like a knife and it's separate the soft tissue
*  It's actually a good technique and yeah, it was fun
*  But it's been about two years now since I've been back in the bush because you know the nutrition though so much stronger
*  Yeah, so good for athletes for someone like yourself my god that that fallow deer and stag that nutrition is as good as it gets
*  Yeah, wild animals
*  I think even I think was before the brunson fight because long story, but like after my debut
*  I'll go back to this but like pretty much the the brunson fight
*  Before it was when I realized how you eat affects how you think and how you feel your mental health
*  No sure because beforehand before the fight before I couldn't wait
*  I was eating like shit like literally just because you know, I cut weight easy
*  So I'm just eating everything what not and then throughout that camp I was getting like I hurt myself as well
*  Remember I mentioned at the post fight press conference and then I had to take a whole week of training
*  This is like five weeks out and I have to make the call like fuck
*  We're gonna pull from this fight. So we don't leave it too late so they can find a replacement or
*  Take a whole week off
*  Come back Monday and then see how we feel and then doing that I ate right I ate proper
*  You know
*  I was a little bit like depressed and shit like that because of the way I was eating already but that week
*  Transitioned everything just because the way I was eating and the way I looked after my body and then when I got back to camp
*  Boom and I realized through that camp and also reading Charlamagne's book as well the shook ones
*  Oh, yeah, it kind of helped me on listening to it. Yeah, I listened to it too. Yeah reading
*  Yeah, well, that's a good one to listen to too because it's read by him. He's funny interesting orator
*  Yeah, the way reads it because I listen to brilliant it is as well. Yeah, he's honest
*  Yeah, he's on I mean like for a guy like him to talk about being fucked up with anxiety
*  It's like people like what you you think I would talk about crazy shit. People don't understand man. Like even my boy chance
*  He's with me right now, you know, like for me I like to cuz I'm on this journey now
*  I like to take those that came up with me. I bring them on this journey like I went to Dubai
*  I brought my brother with me so I can inspire him. I went to Nigeria. I brought a B with me
*  you know cuz he's Nigerian I
*  Told him after this trip like be careful cuz you're gonna you know holiday blues
*  You know, like when you come back from a holiday you feel oh and everyone all these Instagram hosts post take me back
*  You know with their bikini shorts and whatnot. I told him I wouldn't get back home
*  You're gonna feel it and I know cuz I've experienced it as well after my UFC debut I
*  Literally my after party was three hours of just
*  Hi, nice to meet you. Hi. At one point. I literally went to go hide somewhere and some guy found me
*  He's like bro. You all right. What are you doing? I'm like, I'm good. I'm just chill. I'm just taking five minutes alone
*  Oh, yeah, it's like now. Yeah, I understand a and just sat next to me. I'm just like fuck
*  Alone means you hear motherfucker and then after I go home
*  Like, you know go to bonus got a nice check from the UFC and then got depressed and I'm just like
*  Yeah, like I'm home alone with my own thoughts and I was like what the fuck I didn't get that
*  I didn't understand this so I even just cuz of everything that was happening
*  I started seeing a therapist straight away just cuz I felt like no one teaches you how to be famous
*  There's no fucking book about this and I've seen a lot of people athletes movies singers rappers rise and fall
*  And I'm not gonna be one of those people
*  But then I went to a therapist from October from February to October just kind of like
*  Learn some tools to help me with this and then so after my first fight I happen my second fight
*  I have my third fight Brad to virus fight main event
*  Fucking all the stimulus. It's like coffee you drink coffee and then you get all the stimulus your hype and you come off it crash
*  Yeah, I quit I equate it to the same thing and then
*  Those tools that I got from my therapist really helped me just kind of like navigate back
*  So New York was the first fight I got back to my house and I was like right boom
*  I know how to attack this I know what's gonna happen and I was anticipating because beforehand I
*  Didn't anticipate the um the hype that was gonna happen the wave
*  After the fight like after this fight already know what's happened like I knew it was gonna be like
*  More than everything I've done in the UFC already
*  So I braced for it and I prepared myself and I had the right people and the right tools to help me ease back into my
*  Regular routine so I went back home and it was just easy
*  What was the feeling of depression because obviously you had this spectacular result you you won
*  Yeah, and then but what what was it? What was the feeling like what was bothering you if I think about in my debut?
*  When I got back home sit down
*  It was just like I don't know and that's not I hate trust me I love fucking the perks fuck fame
*  I don't like being famous, but I love the perks a lot of perks
*  But like when you get back home, and I'm with that's why I like hanging out my dogs and my cat cuz they don't say anything
*  I can just be I can just exist with them. I don't have to entertain them. I don't have to talk right
*  Country to popular belief. I'm not always extroverted. I'm a cuss baby. I'm a crab lion cancer Leo a crab line
*  I can go you know both ways you know hard soft
*  But you know
*  But like yeah, so I can when I'm home by myself, I'm just very reserved. I like to be in my own thoughts
*  I like to be in my own space. You know like what whole he had to do in Panama or wherever he was yeah
*  And the feeling was just not it's almost I've heard of imposter syndrome
*  Mm-hmm, I I'm not sure if I'm saying that if I'm using a right, but I don't know
*  I want I don't want to say that's what I had but like you almost feel like you don't you don't belong
*  Yeah, I don't know I don't deserve this everybody. I think everybody has that yeah
*  So what so I had to go through that for my first fight my second fight my third fight and like I said it wasn't
*  Until the Brunson fight. I just decided to fuck it own it cuz in New York. Yeah, there's this clip on YouTube of this guy
*  He's walking around Times Square normal
*  Just chilling no one pays attention to him, and then he goes to
*  He goes comes back at nighttime, and then he's hired like security camera crew. He dresses the part and he's walking around Trimed Square
*  He's just a regular do like a YouTube content creator, and then everyone's done to like who's this?
*  Oh, can I take a photo?
*  Yeah, cool take a photo yeah cool, and then like the camera guy goes up to random people and goes like so
*  How do you know his name is Brian? How do you know Brian? How do you and they're like?
*  Oh, I saw him in spider-man. You know yeah, I think it's pretty good. You know and then let's let the guy go to another guy
*  You know so what do you think about his last album?
*  I
*  Mean I didn't hear the whole thing about her the single on the radio and people just lying through their teeth
*  Lying through their teeth about who the fuck this guy is when they don't even know who he was right I experienced that deja vu
*  Fucking crazy in Times Square in New York Madison Square Garden
*  I experienced that in Times Square like literally shooting for my brand engage shooting some shots for them
*  So is embedded crew around me my crew around me, and I'm not even trying and at one point
*  I kind of just cuz I'm always noticing everything around me
*  And I see people like some people recognize where I was and then I saw people like and I can hear them like who is
*  He in the same person come amen big fan. Yo, can I grab a pic? I'm just like all right
*  Take a pic and the next person like and he said hi
*  Can I get a picture and just take a picture and they don't know who the fuck I am
*  They just know somebody likes you exactly they just are he's famous
*  Yeah, and they just want to get that shine so shit like that kind of humbles you and lets you know you can get caught
*  And all that shit man talk about hype a lot, and I'm like fuck it just own it
*  New York was when I decided like I'm not gonna feel like I don't belong just own it. This is my life now
*  Well, I think what you're doing is you're taking the mentality of a high-level striker
*  And you're applying it to fame because you don't want to get caught in traps
*  You understand you want to see all the pitfalls like if you're your chins up you drop your hand if you you have a
*  Tenancy that someone can exploit you gotta go. I'll make sure I'll mix this up make sure I'm different moves
*  You you don't want to get caught in traps. Yeah, I don't want to get caught never
*  Yeah, that's but that is also what happens with fame. You get caught in your own traps. You set your own traps
*  Yeah, I know I make my own mistakes. I won't crash into a pregnant lady Bob. I make my own mistakes
*  Sorry, I'm taking all the shots
*  Come get it well when you and him started going after it you and John Jones started going after it on Instagram
*  I was like oh, no, let it be known he started it. Yes. He started it. Why did he start it?
*  I think some the freshman I'm the guy that he wishes he was and he's a fan trust me. He's a fan
*  He's my biggest fan, and I think he sees himself
*  You know like man. I could have been that cool
*  You know fighting fuck all this up, and he sees me like the new freshman getting all the shine getting all the hype
*  He's still a champ and he's still undefeated really no really really on this fight. Yes. Oh fuck that
*  I'm a shit bullshit. I'm all talking not at him talking shit. I'm trying he was just trying to talk
*  He was just trying yeah, you know I don't mean Matt Hamill's probably broke. Yeah, you know I'm saying he hasn't fought in forever
*  Yeah, he just won another he's undefeated. He's a guy like I think I first watched him fight because I was a fan
*  It was a UFC 94
*  Penn versus GSP to and he fought Stephon
*  Yeah, and just hit him with some stuff and with that spinning elbow hit him with that double overhook lateral draw
*  Fucks this guy yeah, you know and you know the comparisons were always gonna be there like with him
*  And oh, this is silver with wrestling then when I came on the scene all this Jones a better striking. I'm like
*  And I said it from the get-go. I'll outgrow those those comparisons. I was like oh, they're gonna forget about this
*  So now they're not comparing us. They're saying ooh. Let's watch them fight. Yeah, I like the fight. I said this is July
*  After the I think it was the MMA Awards I was in my hotel room and
*  Allegedly I might have been stoned but I look at allegedly I was fucking stoned
*  And I was looking across and I could see Rader Stadium being built
*  And I was like for whatever reason just decided that's where it's gonna happen
*  It's such a fucking crazy fight the way it's gonna happen. It's just
*  Boom, let him go to heavyweight. I'll drag him back down. I'll drag him back down
*  And I said like 2021 is the time cuz I don't want to disrespect the game
*  I'm not gonna hold up the division
*  The division be held up long enough by Robert fucking being sick and being injured and you know Romero not making win all this shit
*  I'm like, let me do what silver did which was honor the fucking code and actually be a champion and defend the belt
*  So I'm gonna do that. I've done it once against Robert Whitaker double interim champ. So I'm gonna do it again
*  It's killers out there. I even saw a can in here in the weekend and he's a fucking beautiful dude, man
*  It's such a nice guy. He's a very nice guy. What's up, brother? Are you doing exactly? He's a dark horse
*  He's the dark. Yes. Everyone thinks Romero is everyone thinks cost there's the one nah. He is the guy
*  Like I'm stalking him. I've been watching the man
*  He's another guy that's made a shift mmm over the last year and a half or so Jared's made a shift
*  Well, he's just become more and more serious more more dangerous and you watch him
*  No, when he took out Anderson Silva, he fucked his leg up. Jesus like yeah, he's on on a mission. Yes on a mission
*  I see him and I'm not slipping. They'll never catch me slipping unless I slip him and I rip him
*  He's got fantastic genetics to me. That guy's a tank. See I saw when he was fighting this guy a heavyweight
*  He was heavyweight. Yeah, you walked him down with his hands down
*  Heavyweight, yeah
*  Shredded yeah, it's crazy. Man. I'm gonna go all the way from heavyweight to 185. That's
*  Fucking phenomenal. I think Roy Nelson should have done it to be honest
*  What do you think about that kid Edmund Shabazzian?
*  I saw his fight. I didn't know who he was till I'm I think it was Tim. I'm saying his last name, right, right?
*  Yeah, so long. What's his name? I'm Tim told me like oh shit that I rewatch the fight
*  That's he alive I can't remember dude he's 21 and he had brights of eyes with the head kick and that kind of got my
*  Attention like oh shit. Who's this kid?
*  Starts him with that right hand and you know, that's what I mean. Like he's at 185. He's 21. Yeah, he's on the come-up
*  Yeah, just beat I played with Brad for five rounds. He starts him in one round, you know, I'm not taking that likely
*  Yeah, I look at that kid
*  Eventually when it when he comes up, you know, I'm sure I'll see him at some point, but that's what I mean
*  I need to get back to work. Don't get me wrong. I understand. I'm working. Yeah
*  But like I want to you know, you know the formal. Yeah
*  Well, that's a country as well if I don't train that is the thing of pressure
*  That is the thing of pressure of being a champion, you know, I'll never forget when
*  BJ Penn choked out Matt Hughes to win the title 170 and I was interviewing Matt in the in the octagon
*  He was real honest about he goes. I'm gonna be honest with you. This is a relief
*  He was the pressure the pressure of all these guys coming after me for so long he goes
*  I'm glad it's off my shoulder. They're not used to it. And that's why I said that about Robert
*  Oh, I said on record. Like I said, he's not used to this pressures and acquired taste. It's an acquired taste
*  Not everyone likes it. It's like caviar or a goosey or yeah, you know like go exactly people don't understand it
*  And for me before the UFC there's a hype, you know
*  I jump in the UFC do my work hype hype hype all the way through
*  Yeah, and I said I've been chopping this pressure for breakfast lunch and dinner
*  It's easy to me the guys been away the whole time
*  I've been running through the fucking division the time I've been clear
*  You know like staking my claim as a fucking champ and he's not used to this pressure and your comeback fight
*  You want to come up in the biggest show against me?
*  I wouldn't even if I was a coach
*  16 months is too long to put a guy against me and I said he's not gonna be used to it
*  And he said all you know, I don't care, you know, this is our fellas know as good as he thinks he is
*  I was like, all right watch this
*  Well, the thing about the UFC is you don't get tune-up fights. Nah, they don't exist
*  That's why I said I'm gonna I'm gonna come here ready cuz I know they're gonna put me in the deep end
*  You're gonna put me against the guy. So that's why me and Eugene had the plan. Like we got to be ready for everyone. Yeah
*  To be honest, I'm glad it happened the way it happened. I'm glad I didn't rush and people were like, oh
*  Well, you're not the youngest champion UFC history
*  I mean, I didn't want to be cuz if I if not, like I'm glad all this shit happened to me
*  No when I was 23 or 24 cuz I would have fucked up don't weigh where shit, you know
*  But I'm happy that I matured I had my metamorphosis when I was 28 and that's when a shift happened for me
*  that's when I became trying to help a lot as well like being away from my comfort zone being in the mainland and
*  Hey
*  Oppa
*  Like China helped me get ready for all this cuz being a big black man in the mainland
*  They don't really see people like us all the time
*  Fighting in my first stadium show in China in front of 40,000 people being mobbed in China all that stuff
*  I just use this rep. So I was like, okay, this is all preparing me for this
*  This is all preparing me for the big time
*  So when this time comes I got to be ready and I got to roll out
*  Do you have a very wise way of looking at the future and I think that's what led you to?
*  Getting therapy when you started feeling a little weird after your first fight
*  I mean, that's a very intelligent that to seek help to try to figure out
*  Okay, there's got to be a good way to handle this and I need tools
*  Yeah, there's a stigma around it as well. Even when I mentioned I think I put it off
*  I put my own on my Instagram story after
*  My win against Robert Whitaker. I went to a therapist that Monday the session was supposed to last
*  Maybe an hour and a half
*  We finished in 30 minutes because I saw her two weeks beforehand the week of the fight and then I saw her after the fight
*  And literally was like cool. I think we got what we needed. I'll see you if I need you again, but then people were like, oh
*  So brave, you know you come out and you know people with mental illness and oh my god hashtag
*  I'm like, I'm not is it not
*  Everyone is mentally ill but everyone has to look after the mental health. Yes, don't then you will get sick
*  Physical health yeah, if I start eating shit drinking all day, I'll get physically sick
*  So if you don't look after your mental health, then you're gonna get mentally ill
*  And then they're gonna put you in a straight jacket. Yes, and all that, you know, like, yeah, you don't want that
*  So for me, I just have to look after myself. I don't want to end up like
*  2007 Brittany, you know
*  I think she looked all right
*  That's awesome
*  You're dealing with a young person and when you said about that you're not the youngest ever champ
*  I don't think it's good. I don't think it's good to have that kind of un
*  Unqualified success at an early not unqualified. You don't deserve it. But yeah unprecedented at a young age like Mike Tyson like Mike Tyson
*  He'll talk openly about it man. I mean now you ever have you hung out with Mike?
*  No, I was supposed to this week, but he's busy. So another time well, I look forward to it dude
*  Let's do the hotbox together
*  Yes
*  He's a nice guy man, and he's he's so
*  Philosophical about his past. Yeah in the way he's very
*  Garbage. Yeah garbage. Yeah
*  He doesn't like to even think about who he was he doesn't like to work out
*  Yeah, because he doesn't want to bring that ego back thing see him with Francis in Ghana when he's ripping
*  Yeah
*  But he what apparently he's gonna train Francis yeah, he said yeah that would be interesting apparently gypsy King's gonna do MMA
*  I'd love to see it man. If you can actually like once he gets that first leg kick. He's gonna
*  Have I done but now you better get it before you get in the cage
*  I'll say that you ever see Shannon the cannon Briggs talk about when he fought when he fought in k1. I listen to that
*  Oh my god
*  Any spar
*  Take this and knock him out. He fought Tom Erickson big cat
*  Motherfucker, I'm a natural 290 pound dude natural. Oh, she's gigantic
*  Erickson was huge. That's a lay we have a guy that Jim Carlos Alberg like beautiful like built motherfucker
*  He kicks cuz he's someone as well. I think yeah full someone he kicks and man
*  You don't want to hold paths. Oh, if you have to hold vo2 max kickboxing for him
*  He can break arms man, and I'm sure he used to be a boxer
*  He only just learned how to kick and now I've been watching him. He's turning his hip over
*  He's also a former King in the ring champ as well current King in the ring chant
*  But like literally he yeah bones
*  Muscles muscle and you don't you don't want that
*  I was at Beverly Hills jujitsu way back in the day in the 90s and I watched Pedro Hizzo kick the bag
*  Yeah, he just
*  Pedro Hizzo was a good check Pedro Hizzo's legs are both of my legs glued together
*  So big even now even now still thick but he was in my opinion the best heavyweight in in the history of
*  MMA the best heavyweight leg kicker. Wow, he would throw leg kicks and my one is
*  Hardonk. Oh, yeah
*  He's swing that oh, yeah, it's a different style. Yes. Yes, but I still I do mind
*  There's many types of leg kicks. We don't know. Mm-hmm. Like there's many types of jazz
*  There's levels to this and he had this one where he'd like swivel his hip like he'd almost just like a Barbie like take
*  His leg and just mm-hmm. Yeah
*  Almost like a low Brazilian kick. Yeah, almost like a
*  But low
*  Fatosa did he did the question mark kick better than anybody who's that remind me? Lafay tosa fought in k1. Okay, go to
*  Robin Black's Twitter page from today. He posted a glob a fatosic KO
*  Glabe, I mean everybody knew the question mark kick, right?
*  You go up the middle and then you go around this way to a head kick
*  But glob a will go up and down this crazy way like his hips
*  Swiveled he had it he had the dexterity of that down in
*  Just this crazy way that very few because like you would have your hands up in a good position
*  He would come over your hands and drop down on your face. Yeah at an angle
*  I've done that before inspiring just like this is years ago. I did I would say to who you see it on Robin's page
*  He retweeted it earlier today. He retweeted his own shit, which is hilarious
*  It's like when people at you your own comment. I'm like, yeah, it's my page. Why you gotta at me?
*  I don't know. It doesn't mean anything but just fucking pet peeves. I'm a hundred percent giving up on reading my ass
*  Yeah, I don't read a goddamn thing that comes my way. You just just spitting into the wind
*  Yeah
*  Come out in a while like if fight week is when I have time the best one was New York
*  New York I get there early and this guy was already bugging me for because you see like in the notifications when you scroll up
*  I'm like this guy again. So I was like, I got time today boom
*  I went at him man, and I remember some fan some fan and he was like, it was a you know
*  Hey Israel not I like winning this DMs and I started going back and forth with him and I scream recorded the
*  Interaction and then eventually after the fight, I think maybe about two weeks after I roasted and posted him
*  He changed his Instagram name
*  Shit got reported. I was like
*  person to fuck with
*  Like Dana sometimes if I have if I if I got time today
*  I got time to like John Jones same thing one day
*  I just went at him cuz he was just going back and forth on Twitter with no bag
*  He was going for from I just kind of ignored him. I was living my life and like sometimes two weeks ago
*  I was just like, you know what home my beer. Well, he's not coming. He's not coming after you unless you're a threat
*  Yeah, exactly. There's no see watch the video play the video
*  Fatosa there it goes. Oh, no, what now watch this left kick man. Oh
*  And they does the
*  I've seen that before in the k1 ultimate knockout highlights
*  But watch the the motion of the kick when Robin but breaks it down sweat this
*  Look at this watch this the final part watch this shit right here. Watch this
*  Come on son
*  Come on who the fuck does that?
*  Glaube is the master of the question mark kick to the point where they call it the Brazilian kick man
*  I mean but he almost did it different than a question mark kick because essentially he was making it look like he was throwing a
*  Body roundhouse kick he wasn't like the real question mark kick is like a front kick that you turn into a round kick
*  Yeah, but he globally was throwing it like he was throwing it to the body and then last second. Look at this shit
*  Right here. It's my favorite part. I mean, this is like a way this background Kiyoshi. Yeah, Kiyoshi. Look at this. Come on
*  I went over the guard to over the garden just like better than anybody on it better than anybody
*  And that that fucking yeah the end finish off
*  Lobby had I mean he had a weird way of moving his hips that you go, man
*  I don't know how many people can fucking move their hips like that. Yeah
*  Yeah, this uh, that was a I mean sometimes someone that just develops a way of doing a kick
*  There's like different than everybody else. Yeah, even even now like Eugene likes to make fun of me
*  Like you're getting old and my wife is like it takes me about a week for my hips to warm up before the kick starts
*  I like happen the way that only should I'm like fuck so he goes back and forth with me on that
*  But I'm getting into I've been doing yoga for a while. I kind of slapped off a little bit this camp
*  But offseason I'm gonna get back into it just cuz I'm 30 now only I don't really feel older
*  That's the thing like it's supposed to magically suddenly sneeze and blow your back out and all this shit 40. Yeah, okay
*  40 should start where only thing I've noticed is just a hangover stick a whole day now, that's all
*  That's the only thing cuz I was liquid IV. Yeah, oh Vegas
*  But I had to ask first cuz you know you saw that you can't know liquid IV is a drink
*  Oh, yeah, it's formulated. Oh water. It's called liquid IV. They just pour it poured into water. Okay, rehydrates you much quicker
*  Is it like a brand? Yeah, it's a sponsor of the podcast. Okay
*  What is it like it hydrates you two to three times faster than water alone?
*  It's like drinking three bottles of water minerals, yeah, please. Thank you. Yeah, it's very smart
*  Scientific concoction I will take that that'll help you
*  Yeah, I mean there's a lot of little tricks you can do to get rid of the hangovers glutathione is another one glutathione is
*  It's heard the name. Yeah, it's I don't know what the exact term what kind of molecule it is specifically, but it's a
*  But it's glutathione exactly glutathione, but what it does is it helps your body break down alcohol at an accelerated rate
*  Yeah, and a lot of times people take it while they're drinking or take a little home over. Yes, just drink some more
*  Yeah, cuz I hangover that is alcohol, but I don't drink that crazy though. I'm not like an alcoholic or nothing
*  Well, dr. Karl Hart explained that to me. Yeah, he said that's where I hangover actually is is your body's withdrawals from alcohol
*  That's why people say, you know, what's that expression?
*  Something the dog that bit you was what is that?
*  Yes, by the hair of the dog that bit you yes like so when you're hungover you have an extra like a bloody Mary
*  That's what bloody Mary's are for
*  It's like the hair of the dog the hair of the dog not bite the hair of the dog
*  But the hair of the dog that bit you so you don't want to the whole dog
*  You just want a little bit over that hung hangover and that's what bloody Mary's out
*  Yeah, bloody Mary's are like just a little drink in the morning
*  Yeah, just a little just a little bit with tomato juice and the celery to pretend that you're fucking healthy
*  But most of the brunch I don't know how dudes live in Vegas and train
*  Last time I was there. Holy shit. So I was there in July
*  For eight days the first three days. I did my testing at the PI. I was training, you know
*  No drinking nothing like that. And then the MMA Awards happened
*  the next five nights
*  Fuck me. I was just one. I just wanted to leave man, but you can't help it cuz just
*  You're in there and then it's just oh, yeah cool you want to come to this club? Yeah, we got VIP
*  That's where he said he saw me at the club shirtless it wasn't inside it was outside
*  There was no women around me. It was literally just people in the next roof
*  Boy, it just looks that way and he kind of had a little flavor
*  You know of what I said, but I didn't say all I said was like I know you know
*  Yo, yo boy
*  But I want to see him cuz he's a bad motherfucker
*  And I said I want to fight all the bad motherfuckers of this of this era
*  Yeah, he's one of them so and he nice to say he respected that so respect to that
*  But I didn't say nothing about you know legacy and like I don't fight him. I want to fight him
*  I've called him out and he put that other video like, you know, why are you hiding? I'm like, I'm not hiding
*  I want to fucking fight you. I want that fight. I love you. I feel like that's the fight right now
*  I mean, I don't see anybody other I mean a rebound rematch with Whitaker is hard to sell right now. You starched him
*  Yes, he's got to come back and do something the that is the fight the waiting so I think you'll over Marrows
*  Costas got an injury. He just had his bicep repaired
*  Think you faked a surgery
*  Sips tea
*  No, but um, I just don't believe anything after Icarus man like after seeing
*  Believe no one that documentary fuck my painting man out there with the Diaz brothers
*  Everybody's on steroids. Everybody's on steroids. Shout out to Dos Brock. Yeah, I met him. He's a cool dude. He's a fucking crazy dude man
*  I like how he takes all his pictures with a little bandana over his face. I did one as well
*  I put the bandana on there. I took it too. I was like I see you
*  But um, yeah, I don't know like he can heal up or whatever, but give me your the middle
*  Yeah, I said it I've said it I'll say it again. I'm not ducking no one. I ain't fucking ducking nobody. Give me the fight
*  Yeah, I don't understand the idea that he's lost all those fights
*  You can't have a fight for the title. You talk to Uncle Dana. Please Dana. Listen to me
*  That's you can make that fight. Everybody wants to see it
*  100% 100% of the hardcore fans want to see it. All you have to do is show a yo El Romero heart
*  I will do a countdown for that. I don't do those anymore. I will do it for that fight. I swear to God
*  I look forward to the challenge man. I want that fight. I want to see it. Yeah, I want to see it because he's
*  I gotta find his neck. He's a unique champ. I want to find his neck. It's a solid combo. What's his name?
*  Misha Misha sir, sir, can off. Uh-huh. I'm telling you my Peruvian necktie is tight now
*  Oh, I thought I knew what it was
*  I thought I had it before I used to get it like maybe 30% of the time
*  Yeah, my man showed me some shit and he also showed me cuz you see the Gaston fight
*  Do you know where that came from? Prove you next time? No, it's going to Suza. Oh, yeah. Yeah, this is a invented it
*  I think he invented it because if he didn't invent it, he fucking nailed it
*  Yeah, so it became to prove the necktie
*  Beast if I can't is one of the lost beasts
*  I guys love watch that guy fight fucking prove your motherfucker with a big thick beard fought like a savage
*  Tough as shit tough as shit Tony de Suza people forgot about they sleep on there's so many great fighters from the old days
*  They get slept on but Tony de Suza is the one sort of like, you know
*  Like the the von flu choke is Jason von flu, but I think you gotta rename that the oh
*  I want to rename the I want I want to rename the Peruvian once I do what OSP's been doing cuz even like
*  He invented the Peruvian necktie I think de Suza invented it it's credited as the modified guillotine choke
*  Yeah
*  Yeah, I think he invented it that what it is is for people don't know what we're talking about
*  It's kind of like a sideways guillotine. We throw the leg over the head in the back. It's nasty
*  Oh, it hurts like I was doing it like this with this grip and then homeboy Misha showed me how to get deep
*  Mmm, and then hold it from here get Marcelo Garcia style. Yeah
*  Yeah
*  Yeah, throw the legs over and it's Tony Tony de Suza old school. Yeah, he figured it out man
*  He figured out and it's all about that leg over the head man
*  What you got that leg over the head I can leg press heavy weight some heavy weight
*  So when you put that on the back of someone's head and you go
*  Yeah, straight away. It's a nice one bunch of people have got it CB dollways got it before a few other guys have got it
*  I saw CB doll always one Doberman
*  I saw that one but there's um, like in the gas I'm fighting the last like 20 seconds
*  I had a front headlock on him and I thought about going for a dars choke
*  But I knew you might yell at me. So I did it. Why would he yell at you?
*  Didn't want you to grab them at all. No, no, no, no just because I had the guillotine
*  I had the triangle but it was slippery and also I was already winning the striking
*  I don't want to end up like Frank Mayer when he fought in Noguera
*  Well, that was an interesting thing when you did go to your back you were throwing up triangles
*  This is dangerous off his back this isn't this isn't a defensive guard, but I was like he's attacking but I kind of knew
*  I mean even though I hadn't seen it
*  I know who you are like you're not gonna be a guy who doesn't have anything off your back
*  Like you're not gonna have a hole like that. You're gonna figure that out and I'm still like I'm still learning man
*  I'm still a white but it took me five years to get my blue belt, you know under the Galval gave me my blue belt
*  Oh, yeah, I was like
*  I'm still a white train with Galval and so yeah, I haven't trained there
*  But he's come over and he we are affiliated with a school and they have a program
*  They don't just give it out
*  but like they have to like
*  Fet them and they have a really good relationship with my coach Adam Johnson my jujitsu coach and
*  Analyst and also Eugene bareman. So when he saw me rolling and stuff like that, I think he's like, uh, oh
*  That's great blue belt. So yeah, then I bought fuck. Yeah, I was just surprised
*  I didn't get my blue belt that day, but I didn't mind I was like fuck
*  That's a nice white belt for life to get it from
*  Yeah
*  Yeah, and I was even looking forward to train with Gordon Ryan and then when I was in New York
*  But fucking this thing will let me yeah
*  Just like swap skills
*  Rolling with him maybe later on but like yeah
*  Like I just wanted to swap skills cuz you know, he had they know some shit like some shit about grappling that we don't know
*  Well, Donna her is a legitimate genie guy as well. And he knows some shit you talk to that guy
*  Look in his eyes is a darkness and that guy's soul. I saw him on the podcast when he's talking to you. Yes
*  He's intense. You're like professor X
*  He's like the real live professor X
*  He's spooky smart to a spooky smart. I was gonna swap some skills. Yeah, I'm going to Ryan and
*  What's his name?
*  Gary Tony, whatever else yeah, but like Eddie Cummings branched off. He's got his own gym now, but he's another master
*  Yeah, you know those guys are that whole it's really interesting what happened out of that whole gym
*  That gym really that was the epicenter of the revolution
*  They they sort of started this whole leg lock revolution and jiu-jitsu Dean Lister say
*  Why would you ignore 50% of the human body boom and then Donna her was like that's the that's the switch
*  Why would you that's the scene? That was it?
*  And it really was because Dean Lister was tapping people with leg locks and heel hooks back when you would get booed
*  You know, I remember I saw Dean Lister compete in Abu Dhabi in Sao Paulo Brazil in
*  2003 you know and there was there was there. Yeah. Yeah, cuz Eddie Bravo fought Hoyler Gracie. That's right
*  You said I flew over with Eddie and
*  Not crazy
*  Dude, I never been so happy in all my life. Yeah, even the last way. Yeah with um, who was it?
*  Which Gracie was it the last fight Eddie he fought Hoyler again. Well, yes, right? Yeah, Adam in that
*  Hoyler did wooden tap. He had him in what's called the what is it?
*  The template so much but yes had his legs like this and I could see his groin like about to tear
*  Well, his knee was fucking I forget it's some nuclear word. I forget the word
*  Vaporizer vaporizer
*  Dude he was ripping Hoyler's knee apart and as a person who's had three knee surgeries, I was watching it
*  Please just tap just tap it ain't worth it. He was the pride
*  But he wouldn't tap it with anything remember when he fought Sakuraba Sakuraba had a in a deep camora way behind his back
*  Yeah, all up like this where it looked like his joints were ripping apart
*  He wouldn't tap and they stop the fight. Yeah, they stopped the fight have to well they didn't have to let him get a shit
*  You know, it'd be like some shinny
*  Meir did that to no Gara. Oh, bro
*  Yeah, is that moment where it's just like fuck it's gonna go look in his arm like this I mean
*  Yeah, I mean his arms never the same again, I mean that's that's a when you get that upper arm snapped like god damn
*  That's a bad guy. That guy he fights like a zombie. He's the original. Yeah, here it is. You don't go
*  This is Eddie is
*  Tearing his fucking knee apart
*  I mean if you if you don't if you've never experienced what this feels like I've only experienced it a couple times
*  It's a terrible feeling man. It's a terrible feeling. It's hard to explain what's going on here
*  But oh wow. Yeah his knee see that yeah is sideways and being mangled
*  Oh, and he's just look and Eddie said it kept popping and Hoyler's just dealing with the paint like right there
*  That's all my god that his knee is tearing apart mental fortitude man. Yeah. Oh man that whole family savages
*  I mean, there's never been a family that's
*  Revolutionized martial arts the way the Gracie family did and Hoyler was the most successful of all the Gracie's and it came to competition
*  He was a multiple-time world champion of course he is look at his fucking man Eddie Bravo's
*  Mangling his knee and he won't tap and Eddie's telling him just tap man. He's like it's fine. It's normal
*  He's like dude your leg just popped five times. He's like it's normal like he's tapping again
*  Eddie's got him wrapped up nasty, and this is some shit Eddie invented this is crazy about all of this I
*  Mean Hoyler to his credit just rather get his knee torn apart than lose
*  When's the last time the Indian came out Eddie probably a couple hours ago?
*  I
*  Love him. I love that
*  We were just talking on the phone the other day
*  And I was driving to this area with the cell phone was about to cut out and he was telling me some crazy
*  Conspiracy, I was like bra bra bra. I love you. I gotta go
*  I love you, too, ma'am. Sorry to do here off
*  He's so crazy oh my god he loves conspiracies he loves conspiracy like it's like his family number one
*  Jiu-jitsu number two
*  Conspiracy
*  Right new one maybe his friends number three and then conspiracies. Oh everybody look into it everybody
*  See, I don't know too deep about it, but even
*  Fucking a champ could tell you
*  dog Marshall could tell
*  Fuckin look man that guy Bill Clinton flew with that guy
*  26 confirmed times 26 might be 28 but 26 confirmed times
*  I read that my bro. I didn't follow with my mother 26 times
*  Yeah, how's this guy fly with Bill Bill Clinton flew with a pedophile?
*  26 times over the period of some island right years fuck island fuck island
*  That's what everybody else called it all right to defend against suicide
*  I'm loving these bees man. Yeah, they snap that guy's fucking neck man. Is that Eddie?
*  They snap that guy's fucking neck they said his neck was fractured
*  They said the how can you do that from hanging yourself? You can how do you how do you hang yourself in jail?
*  Dude, they'll come out eventually that even Michael Shermer. Who's like a professional skeptic?
*  He's the editor of skeptics magazine. Okay. He says probably conspiracy even him
*  Yeah, he said what the cameras are down the cameras weren't working what shut off at that time get the fuck out of it
*  They killed that dude. They killed that dude. No one's talking about it
*  I mean there's that leak where that ABC reporter was saying that ABC squashed the story three years ago
*  That was just just got released Hillary was on Trevor Noah, and he kind of acts yeah
*  He joked around with her yeah, but she laughed about it. Yeah, I thought it was one of those um
*  What do you call the thing the deep fakes mm-hmm? What it was real well? Here's what's crazy
*  She knew that guy yeah, she knew that guy
*  She knew that guy she knew that guy she knew that guy she knew that guy she knew that guy she knew that guy
*  And that guy was most likely murdered in jail and she was laughing about it
*  Yeah, like cuz Trevor Noah said how did you kill Jeffrey Epstein? Yeah, but they were cool. Ha ha ha ha ha
*  But that's like imagine if you knew someone like in your husband was flying around with that guy
*  And this is like a someone you know you you got to know pretty well like you've hung out with him at cocktail parties
*  Like you know like maybe you've known him for years
*  And then that guy gets murdered and then somebody asks you how'd you murder him and you start laughing
*  You gotta be weird you gotta be a cruel
*  Heartless person to think that's funny. That's weird about it. Yeah, she did the same thing with one good
*  Goddafi stuff that was even like that was different though because that wasn't a joke
*  Yeah, she said we came we saw he died ha ha ha but I was someone that wasn't her friend right?
*  Someone who wasn't her friend right this was someone who she knew and you know Trevor know and listen the way the Daily Show works
*  For sure they told it told her beforehand. Yeah, I was like they couldn't have sprung that on her no way
*  No way, you don't spring shit on Hillary goddamn Clinton when she's had all the questions show yeah
*  Yeah, so she'll be ready for that and then like oh ha ha ha ha ha she's got to know you respect her
*  She's got it. I mean there's no way she's coming on that show unless she knows everything's gonna be okay
*  So when they they brought that up and she starts laughing she knew that shit was coming I guarantee you guarantee you
*  Guarantee you they're not free balling on that show come on later on I'm sure to come out later on
*  Some people know too much man. Yeah way too much
*  It probably will be one of those decades later things we find out you know that some some guy on his deathbed says he killed
*  Epstein yeah, cuz Clinton paid him off
*  You know who the fuck knows who knows who that guy who knows what that guy knew I mean that guy that that
*  Guy was a professional blackmailer. You know I don't know who he worked for I have no idea
*  There's more like fuck. I might just be the tip of the iceberg
*  whole shitload of things we have no idea
*  Fuck yeah, yeah, I'm surprised all that kind of stuff gets into politics as well with like um sex trafficking or whatnot
*  It's like right well
*  I think we're building here you can get a guy like that like here's a lot of these guys
*  This is my thoughts a lot of these guys are freaks, and then they're in the public eye
*  So they have to maintain them proper purpose we know Bill Clinton during the 90s in particular. There's no internet fuck
*  He was fucking like just fucking up a storm. He was a wild man
*  Yeah, and you know and there's a few alleged rapes. You know yes
*  I mean, I don't know I wasn't there, but there's women that are accusing him of sexual assault and rape
*  So you got the Monica Lewinsky things you know he's a freak getting his dick sucked by 20
*  Relations with that woman
*  Then when they bust him he's like well as to what I thought sexual relations were
*  But you got to think there's a lot of those dudes out there
*  Yeah, that's why they get into politics in the first place
*  They're on their 60s, so they got into politics in the fucking 80s and the 70s
*  They got into politics as they wanted to fuck they wanted to be the king they wanted to be the guy with all the power
*  They wanted to be the alpha and so then all of a sudden the rules change
*  Because the internet so then they got to figure out my Jesus. I can't do anything anymore. What the fuck
*  So what they do is they find a guy who's gonna take him to an island where there's no rules
*  Hey, man, Jeffrey Epstein's got this place
*  He brings in these girls from Czechoslovakia, and they suck your dick until your head explodes. Let's do it
*  You're on the fucking the boat headed to the island with Clinton you know
*  Yeah, the island where do you get that island no one knows I don't know you buy an island you don't the fucking intelligence agencies
*  Give you money to give you an island they set it up
*  Someone from some agency whether it's Mossad or CIA or whoever the fuck it was
*  They had a concerted effort most likely to try to bring these creepers
*  Bring them over there attempt them with putting them and he know how to do it
*  I think they probably do it as well as like having shit over them
*  Yes, that way they can have like they can get them to do things for them exactly decisions
*  Bills that need to be passed you know fucking
*  Example the the marijuana reform I'm like look we all agree now like you know everyone smokes everybody you know like yeah
*  But like everyone is doing it so they're gonna legalize it can't they just have like a group chat or something and like okay
*  All opposed say nay all for it say aye. Why does it have to take so long?
*  Well the concern is pharmaceutical companies have a massive concern about loss of income that's a big one
*  Even in New Zealand right now. It's taking so long to get pushed
*  And I think they're at the tail end of it. They can't hold back anymore. It's gonna fucking burst. Yeah, that's what it is
*  It's gonna work. It's those people have to set up their own
*  Businesses and whatnot so that way when it comes to boom their first in line to cash in the most egregious
*  Example that is what happened in his home state of Ohio
*  Tell them story about what they did well I've actually been since we brought that up the last couple of days
*  I've been reading that was like some misinformation, and that's not exactly how it even is so I don't know
*  Oh, I'm not like we're not there, so I don't know the exact the the bill was making it
*  So that only a few companies didn't pass a few years ago, and the one that passed right oh no
*  No, I know that but the one that was proposed for a crack the most egregious example
*  They proposed a bill to legalize marijuana, but no one could grow it only a couple companies could grow it
*  And they would make all the profits why exactly so no one can grow it was just a horse shit
*  And by the way, this is forever like they were like for life bitch really my life
*  Yeah, their idea was that they were gonna monopolize the state of Ohio
*  Everybody was like fuck you you know which is we'll wait. Well. I went to muscle farm. I was at um
*  This is in Denver where we call it um muscle farm. What's the name of the team like Dilla shorty?
*  elevate elevate yeah
*  like right next door this big hanger and
*  I'm not a scientist, but the smell in the air
*  Will they grow in skunks? Oh?
*  Literally, I was just like they grow weed
*  100% like literally could smell I was like yeah, and it's now minty man. Yeah, I love the smell
*  Oh, it's a beautiful smell Warren
*  Well is like as a kid because of what I was told and what I was perpetrated
*  Whenever I'd smell either beer because I didn't drink till I was like so I found bourbon
*  I don't like beer long story, but then I didn't drink or did anything
*  I was a goody boy. You know still at my good boy, but once I smell
*  Weed or beer anything reminded me of homeless people like
*  Because of what I was taught as a kid, but then there's an adult now. I'm like where the party at
*  Yeah, want to relax think different show, bro. Yeah, well weed is a great one man because it makes people more like more
*  Comfortable with each other makes people friendlier it sort of always smoke around certain people like I don't from that's just for me personally
*  Cuz I if I don't feel comfortable like if you know you can get into a situation
*  I'm just like why is that guy on this phone cuz sometimes you see people like this is the worst one man
*  Now these days people just like this, and then they just you see their phone just right you know they're filming you yeah
*  I'm like why is your why you texting this way?
*  You ain't got a text this way so common man. I'm sure you get it all the time
*  I would love to do deep bong hits around Donald Trump. Yeah, bro. You don't have to smoke. Just hang out in the room
*  I see what's up?
*  Now about these kids in cages, but even just talking to him highest fuck would be weird like bro
*  Do you why don't you just quit come on man? Just get I use one of those guys he likes the game
*  He likes the game. I'm sure you my favorite comedian of this year, man
*  I follow him on Twitter just cuz of the shit. He says like it's fucking hilarious man. You can't not respect it
*  He says some funny shit sure one of the funniest things he ever said was when he put when he was thinking about buying
*  Greenland yeah, a picture of Trump's hour
*  I promise not to do this Trump's out in the middle of green. I was laughing my ass off
*  It's funny Donald Trump is reportedly discussed making the apprentice White House. Holy shit
*  Ratings you imagine he turns the White House into a set for a reality show
*  Shit, holy shit. Who's that dude?
*  Producer Mark Burnett. Oh, that's Mark Burnett. He's buddies with him see I knew him from the apprentice
*  I watched the first two seasons when I was a kid. Yeah, you're fired. Yeah, remember that but that's his that's his move
*  Yeah, I've heard I've heard some other things
*  You say you were gonna do that, but you didn't do it
*  Well, they offered it to me when I was hosting fear factor the second time around was like 2011
*  But I talked to with my family, but I didn't want to live in New York for three months and all that nastiness
*  I was like I'm not interested. I'm not interested
*  You know, I don't want to pull my kids out and have them go I just didn't want to raise here
*  Yeah, it just didn't seem like a smart thing to do. It just seems like something I'm gonna be annoyed with
*  I didn't want to be angry at anybody. I'm just not that guy
*  I can't feel it right now man months and months of your time for me
*  It's like I want to get fighting done like after my fight
*  I kind of like because we're in Marvel Stadium
*  I kind of said something about Marvel like, you know, I'll see you guys soon or whatever
*  I said, yeah, but after fighting right now, like I said, they're coming for me
*  So I gotta make sure I don't want to end up like some others in this game where they get that, you know
*  Distracted. Yeah, look at you know, Hollywood and the shot. So I get some offers coming to my table right now and I'm just like
*  Yeah, those cautionary tales are there. They're so readily available for you to consume. Look at Ronda Rousey
*  Yeah, Ronda Rousey is the best example. She's on top of the fucking world away
*  They all came coming and she said yes to everything. She was doing everything man. She was doing movies. She's doing interviews
*  She's writing books. She was doing and you know one thing you got to give it to Conor McGregor
*  I mean Conor McGregor said no to all that shit when he was on top. He said no to all that shit
*  I've learned from her from him. Yeah, John silver everyone
*  Like I've seen the highs and the lows of this game man. And like I said, I'll make my own mistakes
*  But guess what? I'll bounce right back. I always will but it's better to make mistakes
*  You'll make less the way you're approaching things. Yeah, you will. I know me. I see you
*  He sees me every day like that's why sometimes I'm like
*  Like the same rhetoric. I'm your biggest fan or you inspire me or this and I'm like I
*  Appreciate that if you can take inspiration from the story that you've seen through TV through media fuck you, you know go hard
*  I'm sure is it weird still seeing your face on people's stomachs. It's very strange. Yeah, like there's a guy
*  Um, how's him Dylan shot to Dylan? He's got my face on his thigh
*  I met him in a club in Auckland and yeah, I flew him plus one to my last fight just cuz I was like
*  I gotta have to tattoo his face on my thigh now. I don't know
*  Get a style bender tattoo free ticket to your
*  How many people you think would do that it's crazy motherfuckers who do it just for the low just like
*  Right. No just for the free tickets is right. It's Sonia the last album incorporated
*  I do not agree with the sentiments of Joe Rogan in the last speech
*  We would have to do it at your own risk
*  How about this we'd have to prove that you got a tattoo style better before this blew up before this day
*  Yeah, so this is like you can't do it. There's only two. There's only two. There's only two. I can't remember the other guy's name
*  That's what you know. You only know about two actually three. There's one chick from somewhere in South America the Brazilian girl
*  I can't remember her name. She's got style bender on her arm. So she look she's all right
*  I can't remember a name of a shout out to my seat. So if you were fucking a girl who had your name tattooed
*  I don't understand moves. That's dangerous move. That's Russian roulette
*  Yeah, son
*  whatever if a chick has like maybe your face on her back or something and some guys hitting her from the back and
*  It's like the world is this that's where I look in there
*  Girl with your name on it though
*  If you met up with a fan who had your name tattooed or your face tattooed on her whoo, that's risky
*  Make sure people are around for that one. Yes, you know everybody allegedly. I don't want to catch no bill calls
*  So I have my hands when you take a picture you just like you do the Keanu Reeves
*  Air-float the floating hand. Yeah catch no bill. I know they're coming man
*  I know cuz I've already foreseen everything that's kind of happening and I know this kind of shit's coming
*  So I just have to make sure you know, like Addison says stay focused, you know, don't eyes cross my T's
*  Don't make sure they don't catch me slipping
*  Well, you're looking at it the right way because you realize that right now you're at the this it's like a funnel, right?
*  You're at the opening of the funnel where it's gonna go
*  the options cuz you're you know, you're
*  newly crowned as the champion
*  Yeah
*  and as you defend the title and start murking motherfuckers and become bigger and bigger and bigger and then the UFC puts you in more and
*  More promos your pay-per-view sell more and more you become an international star then it gets crazy
*  Then you can't go anywhere and people are screaming when they see you walk into a restaurant
*  Even after my press conference in Melbourne before the fight
*  After the press conference the one that the guy with the megaphone was fucking fucking with me on after that that night
*  What was he doing? Yeah, just so I'm sure someone planted it cuz even I asked Robert after I was like, did you pay that guy?
*  He's like fuck. No, I was like you should have cuz he had a megaphone and the whole time
*  He just kept on interrupting me and one then I was going back and forth with him
*  But I liked it because guess what if he wasn't there would have been a boring press conference
*  Robert saying he's not gonna say shit backtracked already
*  but after that press conference
*  I lit up in the alleyway smoked up and I walked around Melbourne with my air pods in and I just walked around the city and
*  I one point I just sat at the tram stop because it didn't so I can just sit there and people just going back and
*  forth and I could just sit there and look normal and just like
*  Soak it all in because I know eventually I won't be able to do shit like this after my debut in in Perth
*  Did the same thing after breakfast the next day just walked around just enjoying the view enjoying just being me cuz
*  I'm not saying I'm gonna blow up but I know I'm gonna blow up. Yeah, you're gonna blow up Isis
*  Yeah, you got it. You just gotta
*  Understand what it is and it's gonna get confusing and what you said earlier about fame is very very smart that you said
*  No one really tells you how to prepare for that. And what about you? How'd you deal with it when you were young?
*  I got a slow drip. I got fame and a slow drip
*  Yeah, I got a tolerance for it because I became I was on television in 1994
*  Nobody knew who the fuck I was. I was one of eight people on a not so successful sitcom
*  It was a great sitcom, but it was not so successful
*  And then I had a couple little television gigs on stand-up comedy shows, but nothing big
*  And so I would I could like kind of sell a weekend at a club, but I had to do morning radio
*  I wasn't famous but I was a little bit known and then fear factor came along that was a big jump
*  That was a big jump. Yeah, that was a big jump
*  That was a big jump because then I was on a giant hit television show that was iconic was on for six years
*  148 episodes it was a family time. That was a big jump, but then there was
*  The cut the podcast which came after all that and the podcast was like a slow run
*  It was like it was slow. You were famous before the podcast. Yeah. Yeah, I was famous
*  But then the podcast changed everything so how'd you deal with it from the big jump from you know?
*  Just a comedian a comedian to fear factor guy. How do you like I used to I just got used to it
*  And I'm also like you in the sense that I don't I
*  Don't want to get caught up doing stupid shit. I don't want to think about things the wrong way
*  Yeah, you gotta get it. What's going on? She's your girls in the window who that?
*  Five more minutes. Is that what she's saying? Do you have something?
*  Yeah working in New York literally they're working you yeah
*  Yeah, yeah five minutes fuck fame is is a trick that works on other people but shouldn't work on you
*  Mmm, you got to know who you are 100%
*  That's the thing if it works on you you're fucked because it's like if you're a magician
*  You really think you pulled a rabbit out of the hat
*  You're fucked now man you're living in the world of nonsense
*  Yeah, I think one thing that helps is martial arts. Yeah, you two helps
*  I'm gonna go get strangled all the time that word man. Honestly, it's over you and I've said it
*  I'm like I'm like what's humble because I've especially in New Zealand is this culture of like
*  People even like they they don't like me because it's all he's notice. He's not humble like a true Kiwi
*  He's not you know, like the all blacks, you know humble and what they mean and I've asked people this what does humble mean and
*  Someone said oh, you know, you just don't brag. I'm like
*  They just mean downplaying your success. Yes, you know, so if anyone like me rocks up and just I'm owning it
*  I'm like you're owning it. Yeah, the champ. I'm the man
*  You're him they say or not. He's not humble, but I tell you what humble is when I have Dan Hooker on my fucking neck
*  Hang man. Yeah humble is when I have Stephen Warby cracking me with an uppercut
*  Humble is when I have Carlos kicking me in the body and making my liver go
*  That's true humility
*  Yeah, but mean like trying to act a your doll my shine just to make someone else feel comfortable
*  That's not humble and I see that as a problem with that like crabs in a bucket thing when when Kamaru was about to win the
*  title reporter asked me like, you know, oh there's a part of you whole hope that uh
*  Kamaru loses so you can be the first Nigerian middleweight champion. I was like fucking what what
*  In the press conference, I was like, I don't think like that that doesn't eight. No, but that doesn't work
*  Yeah, he was hoping I'd say something like that. He was trying to I see them
*  I've banned someone already like I don't do any interviews with them if they talk to me
*  I just next I you know, I had that episode of black mirror. We blocked someone I've blocked him
*  I would report with that and you know record that is they check they take a cheap shot
*  Understand like that's you man. Now you're that guy that takes those cheap shots. Yeah, and everybody's gonna remember that. Yeah
*  Yeah, I mean you think you're just trying to make some noise make a little pop
*  But you're creating bad energy and also no reason. It's not you're trying to get something for now
*  You're not thinking of longevity. Yeah, because in the future I'm not gonna talk to you now. What is it about?
*  Nigerians that why why are Nigerian so clever all these internet scams like when you hear about internet scams, it's Nigerian
*  Right Nigerians come to America
*  They're one of the most successful groups of immigrants in all you all the fucking countries hundred puts whatever countries
*  Nigerians murder it when they come to America. There's something about there's a work ethic, but there's also a cleverness
*  Yeah to Nigerians. I've said it. I've said it before I'm the runt of my people brainwise and body wise because when I went back recently
*  Honestly, man, you see people who are just bricklaying and they're jacked
*  They are ripped some of them and they don't maybe have the best nutrition
*  Right, but they there's something about the genetics of our people is a warrior race and I don't say that likely
*  I'm just being honest. Right it's different, you know, and I
*  think also the culture because I was doing algebra in school when I was like
*  Seven and then I went to know when I first moved to New Zealand
*  Form one I had to do form one in three different countries. So I started form one
*  I don't know what you guys have here one one sound like first grade
*  I don't know how it is
*  But pretty much I was 10 years old and I moved to Ghana for a little bit not repeated again
*  Then I moved to New Zealand that's repeated again because they said no, he's too young
*  You can't be doing that but thing is I wasn't even the smartest
*  I was the bottom three in my class so I wasn't the smartest of the smartest of the bunch in Nigeria in Nigeria
*  So when I came to New Zealand form one, then my first thing in school
*  They had a test like, you know early work out or something on one of the first weeks in school
*  we have to do times table and I knew the song in my head, so I just like
*  Finish miss and all the kids like
*  And I'm just like the fuck and then like they all thought I was this fucking savant this genius
*  And then like this guy asking me questions like, you know, do you brush your teeth?
*  Yes, I do
*  Do like back home. Do you ride on lions?
*  I went home and I was like mom these fucking kids are dumb
*  I
*  Know I didn't understand I just thought like
*  You know, I do regular shit like I but they didn't understand me
*  So yeah, my people are different man, honestly, and I'm like you've seen it and I'm telling you man
*  Especially right now the what I want to do in Nigeria
*  I really I want to introduce them like take the football soccer ball out of their hands and you show them some gloves
*  Mmm, we have some great boxes. We have this thing called Dambe, which is Nigerian wrestling kind of like the Senegalese
*  Which is Nigerian wrestling kind of like the Senegalese type wrestling
*  Okay, some beasts but Dambe, you know
*  They wrap rope around the one hand just one hand and they just pull with the other hand and they wrestle and they throw
*  Strikes also they have like some juju some black magic, you know that kind of stuff like they sprinkle that in there
*  I got my own as well 3 a.m. You know
*  but um
*  literally, I can't wait to like show them like because when I went back I
*  Was trying to just chill low-key sneak into the country, but my dad said it can't happen
*  They're watching you everyone knows who you are from the airport all the area boys Israel this on ya
*  Oh my god, I gotta take a photo police officers showing what's up showing love crooked police officers some of them
*  What's up? Showing love and like I didn't realize like they they stay up till 4 a.m. To watch me and Kamaru fight
*  Wow, they're staying up and I've always said I wanted to be the guy like what Pacquiao was to the Philippines
*  Yeah, you know the way when he fights the whole country shuts down crime drops everything
*  I wanted to be like I feel like after this now, it's gonna keep blowing up and I'm gonna go back next year
*  I'm gonna go back next year. I'm gonna I hope I hope they see the possibilities because I'm telling you man the countries
*  I mean it was um Brazil at first in the early stages of MMA then Japan then America then you know
*  Like it always goes back and forth and then no the Oceania people right now
*  We're doing some work. I'm telling you once not just Nigerians once the Africans once they start stepping in
*  It's gonna be like my 50 cent dropped in the club and then kill the whole game for
*  I'm telling you like they're gonna run the game for a long time for a long time
*  And I'm I'm happy to be a guy that's kind of like paving the way it's crazy though
*  What was it like going back there being the champ going back there? It was beautiful like just seeing my people
*  It's different when you're in Vegas and oh my god, dude. I'm your biggest fan
*  Oh my god, but it's different when you see like a kid just in shock that you're even standing there
*  Like just in shock that you're in his presence and for me, I don't see myself as a style man
*  I'm Israel. I did something at the end of the day, but when they're looking at you and just like
*  You know and this kid I remember like is on my Instagram
*  He was kicking the bag and I just showed them I tweaked him
*  I just told him this to pivot on the foot stand on the toes and turn the hip
*  Literally within a minute he improved his kick like that and I got it on my Instagram somewhere
*  but man, I was really impressed and that was just a little snippet of the of the
*  The creativity of our people look at that way. Oh man, this is gonna make me cry
*  That's because my old primary school man like going back here
*  I was looking like I used to hide there for hide and seek and everything seems so small cuz when you're a kid
*  Everything's so big. This is me. I think I likey Beach just chilling with the people man
*  I was immersed in the culture seeing all those kids in their uniforms on grabbing at your belt. That's
*  Honestly, man, it was like it reminded me of goosebumps again. It reminded me of here. This is just um,
*  The
*  Stadium I went there to go watch and then the guy that the trainer was like shit you are not training
*  I'm like, what do you mean? He's like you are training get up
*  Okay, I had my fucking nice Jordans on and I just had to like work
*  He made and I think he was trying to flex he was trying to show me like you I'm gonna work you right?
*  He put us to work and that's me on holiday as well. It's open state
*  People watch this. Yeah
*  Emg emg
*  Emg access it says Israel the last style bender at Asanya in the YouTube emg YouTube engaged media group
*  That's beautiful man. But there's some more we're doing a documentary right now cuz and they've like just been following me around since 2015
*  And I want to like this is the I want to say this is the end of the first documentary
*  But the beginning of the next one I want to show what I can do in Nigeria what I can do in Africa because even them
*  Kamaru went to Makoko for we almost well not almost died there were then there were some killers
*  You see how that play go back Jamie go back
*  See how that place go back forward is like a maze go for it. Yeah, see how that's like a maze
*  Yeah, the first day we went there. I went there just trying to like show love to the hood say what's up and all this area
*  Boy is like
*  Our guy what he did do here. Like what are you doing here? I'm like, I'm just looking around you
*  I kind of you must set to loss like you got to sell them. You got to make sure they are right
*  I was like, don't worry. We'll look after you guys
*  But then within the first five minutes me and I'd be all on my friend who came with me
*  He's like we got to go because he's very smart. He's very well
*  So we're like, and I had a guy with the AK with me a security guard and the guys the gangsters
*  They were kind of flexing. I was like, oh fuck you guys then so the next day
*  See, that's the asshole in me
*  I went there shirtless all my chains on fucking vest and I got like more security with me with more AKs and went deep
*  We didn't have to go deep to get that skyshort and Jeff hates me for it cuz he fucking panicked the whole time and
*  I went deep and there's all these killers man
*  like literally I'm talking like you see scars on them like marks cuz that's the bodies the body counts and shit like that and
*  This one dude looked like Kimbo slice and he's like the the head honcho and he was arguing with this other guy because
*  They were saying like no, I'm giving them the tour what they give us is my money and I'll sell it to you
*  And he's like no, I'm the you know
*  I'm the big dog you report to me and they were kind of having an argument about it
*  And it was real heated and if they wanted to fuck us up right there and say fuck you guys
*  That's a fucking maze. They know that shit like the back of their hand, right?
*  I have no idea. No, we're fucked and you're walking through exactly and you're walking on planks in the water
*  You saw the water fucking dirty like disgusting, you know, but that's like one of the slums in Nigeria
*  But then you see the before the shot that was Victoria. That's it. That's like the contrast of Nigeria, man. You have
*  dirt poor and you have
*  Well off like Lamborghini's like people living nicely
*  Those are on this side people yeah, but they're smart as fuck. Yes, and that's the email shit is so old now
*  That's like I
*  Don't know
*  Not your uncle don't check your emails
*  I'm a Nigerian prince. Don't worry. You get your money. Just wait. It's just the fees the fees got alike
*  The way the bank account set up all that kind of stuff. Yeah
*  It's amazing that they figured it out to the point where that is synonymous with scams
*  It's like you saw the interior and scams. Yeah, you hear about and that's the thing like we're scamming
*  But a lot of them it's because of the opportunity. They're so smart, but the opportunity isn't there so they can't go to school
*  They can't do that. So they'll hear about the guy who sold a fucking airport that didn't exist
*  To Japan really remember that one a Nigerian dude sold a fucking airport. It wasn't a real airport
*  We're winning. Yeah, I mean people do that with like buildings or Airbnb's but that's a fucking airport airport
*  Okay, bro. He sold an airport fuck the Japanese. That's a thing
*  Yeah, we talked about it like a couple of weeks ago. Yeah, it's
*  Bonkers, they they spent a fuckload of money was like in the 80s or something the 90s. Oh really? Yeah
*  They gotta make a movie about that. Oh, they should here goes 242 million fuck off sold a fake airport for 242
*  How do you do that?
*  Not like I'm saying this is like this is not the best representative by people but this shows you how smart well
*  You're stuck and you got nowhere out and you live in that maze. That's the way out exactly
*  You got to do what you got to do. I understand why when I was in Dubai
*  I don't know if I should say this story. I was gonna fuck it. No one's listening
*  We're on the boat for someone's birthday party and I'm seeing all these kids like 17 16 18
*  With like iced out Rolex's
*  You know, I'm on a yacht partying for some guys birthday and they're just out there flexing and I'm just like what do you do?
*  So I invested in Bitcoin early. I was like, uh-huh now y'all boy
*  Yeah, who boys cuz you know, but I knew already but thing is they're so smart. You know how to work
*  They know how to like and they all over the world. Like I said, we're like a virus. We're Nigerians are everywhere
*  Wherever you look in the world, we're everywhere and we have our claim
*  but I can't wait till this documentary man, like I really want to like
*  Show people over there like what we can do
*  I want to show first of all the story like it's not gonna be like, you know
*  McGregor's documentary was dope, but I was more catered to the MMA fans and anyone can watch it
*  But I want this to be more like the soccer mom can watch it. You know, someone from the burbs someone from
*  Alaska can watch it and still relate. Yeah, I want to there's different there's different levels to this
*  But I'm looking forward to really putting that out. Are you thinking about opening gyms over there in Nigeria? Yes. Yeah, eventually
*  I want to kid out some of the gyms like the one I went to the
*  The stadium sports stadium I was that I want to help them out with some stuff
*  That's later on when I go through right and normally I do things like this
*  Like when I went there I did some stuff but I don't do it for like it's real weird when you're on this platform and I
*  See people trying to do shit for the likes. Yeah, I cringe because I can't do that
*  But when you have a platform like this and you can bring attention to certain
*  Causes and certain people then I don't mind using my platform for shit like that
*  so I really want to bring some attention to my people because I feel like
*  They deserve it. But also they can earn it. They can earn it and I know they can man. I can't wait to show the
*  I'm the first man. Oh, Kamaru's the first. I'm the second see guys like Sadiq first time
*  I watched him fight live. Have you seen him fight live? Yes, Adelaide. I
*  Was watching him skate cage side and he was hitting this guy with body shots. You could hear the
*  Like the pounding I was just like wow in his last fight
*  He showed some like what do you call it on some fortitude as well?
*  He got hit he got cracked and then he cracked the guy and dropped him. I'm telling you man
*  There's a few more coming I can't it'll be fantastic if you open up a gym there and start being a proven ground a train of gym
*  I really want to open the chain of gyms even maybe doesn't have the UFC gyms, but you know, they can get involved
*  Yeah, they can get a cut. Oh, well, you see I'm sure I'd be excited about doing that now, you know
*  I mean be see what's happening. Yeah, it'd be a great thing for them to just as UFC
*  I don't know if it's gonna be in Nigeria, but you have see Africa either Nigeria Morocco or South Africa
*  But
*  Good places to watch over there. They have it set. I'm 100% Yeah, but
*  Thing is the red tapes you got across I'm sure they can get through those
*  I had that in do you see had that in China as well, right?
*  I one of the shows I can't remember which one this is one of the early ones that were threatening to cut the power
*  After a certain time so, you know, they have to settle some people. Mmm to keep the keep the lights on
*  Exactly and that's easy for them, you know the UFC they got money
*  Yeah, I've seen they got a couple bucks a couple a little bit. Yeah, listen, man
*  You gotta get the fuck out of here. Why thanks for coming in
*  I know there they well we did hours. Okay, you're lying. It's 230 men. Fuck off. Yeah flies in this room
*  This is a time zone. It is like the wedding hyperbolic time chamber. Yeah, my brother. I'm happy with what's happening
*  You know, it's my pleasure
*  It's it's great to see that you're doing everything the right way man. It's a it's it's an honor
*  It's an honor to have you in here and it's it's it's special for me to watch someone go through its special to navigate it
*  Honestly, you have no idea my old boss used to get mad at me because she'd be like get that out of your ear
*  Cuz I'd have like one headphone in and I'll just be like
*  And then I'll do it on the side. She can't see so for me to have like you Brian Redbin
*  You know, I think young Jamie was out here back then as well
*  See way back in the day, but like literally like it was just cool just to be here and do this shit like fuck
*  It's all manifestation. It's crazy going man. That's how the world works. We in the matrix. You're showing everybody though
*  Exactly, oh man. All right. That's it. Thank brother respect to you. I'm Jamie. Bye everybody
