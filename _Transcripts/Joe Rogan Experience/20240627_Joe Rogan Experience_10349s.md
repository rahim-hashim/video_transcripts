# Joe Rogan Experience #2035 - Brian Simpson
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6.0s)]
*  Salute. Hey. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10.0s)]
*  We were just talking about how much fun last night was. What a god damn lineup. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=16.0s)]
*  Yeah, what a lineup, man. What a lineup. Ari, Dan Soder, Derrick Poston, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=22.0s)]
*  Ron White, Ron, why you, Tony Hinchcliffe. Yeah, wild lineup. Wild. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=29.0s)]
*  Yeah, what a fucking it's a great place, man. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=34.0s)]
*  We were talking about this last night. The weird thing about that place is even though like we talked about it for so long when we were at the Vulcan, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=37.0s)]
*  like it was almost like one day it's all going to happen and kind of we hoped it happened or hoping it was going to happen. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=46.0s)]
*  But you never know until something actually happens. Yeah, yeah, especially out here. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=53.0s)]
*  But now that it actually happened, it's been open for like, what have you open like six months now or something? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=58.0s)]
*  Yeah, since April. Now it seems like it's always been there. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=62.0s)]
*  It seems like the Overlook Hotel or some shit. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=67.0s)]
*  I mean, because that building, that building has a lot of, I bet you a lot of dope shit's happened in that building. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=70.0s)]
*  100 percent. You know, like just just magical moment like when Oliver, Oliver Anthony. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=75.0s)]
*  Yeah, Oliver Anthony stopped in. The crowd, they was not ready for that. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=84.0s)]
*  Yeah. Man, it was incredible. No one like because I think people now might know that they can be surprised at the mother shit, but like, but this is the first time it hasn't been a comic. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=87.0s)]
*  Right, right, right. You know, he got brought up by Segura. Yeah. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=97.0s)]
*  You know, I don't know what they were expecting, but man. I wish I was there for that one. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=101.0s)]
*  He had done the podcast that day, but I had too much shit I had to do. I had to take off. No, it was incredible. His story's nuts. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=106.0s)]
*  Yeah, and he's a genuine dude. I mean, I still I still don't know a lot about him. You know, yeah, like, you know, but he seems to just really care about people. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=113.0s)]
*  He definitely does. Yeah, he's a real good guy. And, you know, now the question is, I mean, I think he's going to hold on to it. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=123.0s)]
*  But that's the question. Can he hold on to it? I believe he will. I think he'd be fine. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=131.0s)]
*  He's like, fascinating story because he gave his life to God, like 30 days ago. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=135.0s)]
*  And then two weeks later, he has a number one song in the world like that, that he recorded off of a phone. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=143.0s)]
*  One of his songs, the audio that's up online. I mean, it's like very highly rated song was number one at one point in time. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=149.0s)]
*  It's the audio off of a video from his Android phone. So he uploads it to YouTube and then he cuts the WAV file from the YouTube video and uploaded that as a song. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=156.0s)]
*  Wow. No mixing, no studio. This little bitch ass microphone you have at the bottom of your phone. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=167.0s)]
*  And it sounds it sounds odd. What is which one song is that, Jamie? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=174.0s)]
*  Thank God a dollar. Thank God a dollar. But when you listen, can we play it? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=180.0s)]
*  When you listen to it, it kind of adds to it. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=185.0s)]
*  That adds to it that it's not produced. It adds to it that it's not. Doesn't sound perfect. Yeah. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=190.0s)]
*  I mean, it's just a dude singing a song. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=196.0s)]
*  Oh, hey, got a dollar. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=210.0s)]
*  I don't need a dime. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=222.0s)]
*  I got a little spot in the country where I spend all of my time. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=226.0s)]
*  When the sun goes down on this city town, we can pass it around. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=235.0s)]
*  Hey, got a dollar. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=245.0s)]
*  See that soul right there. Yeah, you can't fake that. You know what, man? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=251.0s)]
*  It sounds like he it feels like that in person. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=256.0s)]
*  Like he hit he sounds just like that in person. No, no. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=261.0s)]
*  Like he just his live show was incredible, especially when he got to the hit to the hit. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=266.0s)]
*  You know, yeah, everybody lost. Everyone knew the words. Everyone lost their mind. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=271.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was great. Bro, that video just on my Instagram at one point. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=276.0s)]
*  I don't know what it is now, but it was like 11 million views. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=281.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's he's he's likeable for now. People love him. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=285.0s)]
*  Isn't it funny? We're so cynical. Well, yeah, for now. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=290.0s)]
*  Yeah, because you know how people are fickle. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=294.0s)]
*  But you know, my theory about it is I think you just got to be yourself and take what comes with that instead of trying to please everybody. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=296.0s)]
*  Yeah, because that's what destroys you trying to be fake so you can so you can get stuff. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=306.0s)]
*  He and I had a phone conversation like like right when everything was taken off. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=311.0s)]
*  We communicated on Instagram. He sent me his number. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=317.0s)]
*  I called him up and he was freaking out. And I was like, listen, man, you're going to be fine. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=320.0s)]
*  But you're on a wild ride. You're on a wild ride. I'm like, don't sign nothing. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=325.0s)]
*  Don't sign nothing. I go, don't take any money because it's just a loan. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=329.0s)]
*  It's not real money. Like when they offer you money for stuff like a record deal or something, it's basically a loan. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=333.0s)]
*  I go, listen, you you and everyone's telling me I got a strike while the iron's hot. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=338.0s)]
*  I go, listen, you've got talent. You don't have to do shit. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=342.0s)]
*  Just hang in there, dude. You got talent. You're average. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=347.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's he's the real deal. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=350.0s)]
*  It's like there's certain people you see when you go, oh, you don't have to do shit. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=353.0s)]
*  You're fine. Now the world knows. Now the world knows. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=357.0s)]
*  That guy's fans now like that. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=361.0s)]
*  So he goes from 30 days ago selling industrial equipment, a pothead, like smoking way too much pot, smoking pot all day. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=363.0s)]
*  He said he wasn't getting anything done. He knew that he was procrastinating and wasting his life away. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=372.0s)]
*  And he just broke down and gave himself to God. Started reading scripture every day. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=377.0s)]
*  Instead of getting high? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=382.0s)]
*  Instead of getting high. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=384.0s)]
*  Damn. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=385.0s)]
*  Two weeks later, number one song in the world. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=386.0s)]
*  I wonder what he would have got if he gave his life to Satan. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=388.0s)]
*  He would be that dude with the fucking. What's that guy's name? Sam? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=392.0s)]
*  What's his name with the fucking red skirt on on the Grammys dancing around like the devil? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=395.0s)]
*  What's his name? Sam Smith? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=400.0s)]
*  That guy. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=402.0s)]
*  Oh, you mean Lil Nas X? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=403.0s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. Lil Nas X did it earlier. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=405.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Everyone's doing it now. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=408.0s)]
*  Bro, the Lil Nas X one was hilarious because everybody freaked out. They couldn't believe it. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=410.0s)]
*  This is the guy from. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=414.0s)]
*  Because he was giving the devil a lap dance. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=415.0s)]
*  Yeah, that guy, Sam Smith. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=417.0s)]
*  Oh, Sam Smith. Okay, is this recent? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=419.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was at the Grammys. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=421.0s)]
*  Man, I don't be keeping up with shit. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=422.0s)]
*  Good for you. Don't keep up. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=423.0s)]
*  Yeah, because I'm like, when it comes to the award shows and shit, I'm like, I'll hear about the stuff that I need to see. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=425.0s)]
*  Yeah, you hear about stuff. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=431.0s)]
*  You know, we were playing Johnny Thunder last night, I'm Alive. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=434.0s)]
*  And like, that's that's another cool thing about having friends that have great taste. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=438.0s)]
*  You came up to me and you're like, you got to hear the song. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=443.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=446.0s)]
*  And I was like, okay, hit me with it. And I was like, oh my God, what is this? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=447.0s)]
*  Remember we were trying to figure out what year it was made? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=452.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it's old school. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=454.0s)]
*  You know, because that's what I do every now and then. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=456.0s)]
*  I'll take a song or I can take a playlist and I go make a radio station out of this playlist. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=458.0s)]
*  And then I'll hear new shit that I haven't heard. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=464.0s)]
*  So that just popped up on me when I was listening to Jimi Hendrix. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=468.0s)]
*  God damn, that's a good song. It's so good. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=471.0s)]
*  And it's it's it just it made me sad. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=474.0s)]
*  Not knowing that the dude's dead because it's like I bet he got fucked. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=477.0s)]
*  Yeah. And I didn't like any of his other songs. That made me sad. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=482.0s)]
*  You know, I was real disappointed. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=487.0s)]
*  I only listened to one of the other songs and wasn't into it either. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=489.0s)]
*  Because that's the thing. That's how I know Oliver Anthony is fine. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=492.0s)]
*  Because, you know, you you heard the hit go viral. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=495.0s)]
*  Yeah. You're like, does he have any other good shit? Right. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=498.0s)]
*  All his other shit's good. Yeah. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=501.0s)]
*  No, it's all good. And he writes it all himself, too. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=503.0s)]
*  You mean that WAV file just we just listened to off of a phone is I think he has a Samsung Galaxy S20. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=506.0s)]
*  Keep your publishing, man. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=516.0s)]
*  I mean, that's amazing. It's just a it's a three year old phone. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=518.0s)]
*  And the microphone off the phone records the audio. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=522.0s)]
*  And then when you listen to that audio, it sounds fucking great. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=525.0s)]
*  And you know what? You know what else to do? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=528.0s)]
*  It's like whenever I see a real good live musician, I'm always like, fuck these. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=530.0s)]
*  This is way better than you know, like we don't have we can't do with that. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=534.0s)]
*  Like what he did, you can't do that with a do a different thing. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=539.0s)]
*  Oh, man. It's a whole different thing. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=542.0s)]
*  It's a different thing. And it gets in your soul. Music. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=544.0s)]
*  Yeah. It makes you feel something. It's like a drug. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=546.0s)]
*  Yeah. And it's like people. So, oh, I don't you. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=549.0s)]
*  I guarantee you're not aware it is. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=552.0s)]
*  But but this this is a little this is a little microcosm of what society is. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=554.0s)]
*  Beyonce is on tour right now. Right. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=559.0s)]
*  And she has a song where like in the middle of the song, she goes, everybody on mute. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=562.0s)]
*  And then you got to you got to be quiet for four or five seconds until the beat drops again. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=566.0s)]
*  And so it's like a challenge. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=571.0s)]
*  So every city she goes to, she gets to that part of the song and the whole the whole arena has to be quiet for four or five seconds. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=573.0s)]
*  And people are fucking it up left and right. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=579.0s)]
*  Like like thousands of people are on board and there's always two or three motherfuckers that scream. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=583.0s)]
*  And everyone's like, you know, it's like those people ruin the moment. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=589.0s)]
*  Yeah. Those people should be arrested because they're they're like those are people that are always fucking stuff up for everybody. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=593.0s)]
*  Yeah. It's like all you gotta do is be quiet. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=599.0s)]
*  I think Atlanta got it right. And then L.A. fucked it up big time. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=601.0s)]
*  Of course it does. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=606.0s)]
*  If anybody's going to fuck it up, it's going to be L.A. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=607.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Well, Fenway. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=609.0s)]
*  And if anybody's going to get it right, it would be Atlanta. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=611.0s)]
*  Exactly. People completely disconnected from show business. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=614.0s)]
*  I think it should be a study done on this on like why why Atlanta? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=617.0s)]
*  What specifically about Atlanta? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=621.0s)]
*  Well, right. It's always been known as known as a fun town. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=623.0s)]
*  A lot of great artists have come from Atlanta. A lot of great music, great comedy. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=626.0s)]
*  It's a it's a city, but it's not a city that is has anything to do with entertainment. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=632.0s)]
*  I think when you got anything to do with entertainment, not a film, it's a big film. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=638.0s)]
*  Right. But not because it started there because they went there for the taxes. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=642.0s)]
*  You know, they went there because it's easy. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=648.0s)]
*  Like Massachusetts has that, too. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=650.0s)]
*  What I'm saying about is like you don't move to Georgia to make it as an actor, even though there's a lot of work there. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=652.0s)]
*  You move to Hollywood to make it as it. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=658.0s)]
*  So the most and the weirdest, the fucking most fucked up people, the people that are the most needy, they're going to go to L.A. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=660.0s)]
*  Right. They're going to go to L.A. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=666.0s)]
*  And it's like ingredients in a soup. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=667.0s)]
*  If you got too much hot sauce, that soup gets rough. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=670.0s)]
*  You know, it's sometimes it's just a couple of drops. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=673.0s)]
*  You got a big ass bowl of soup. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=675.0s)]
*  But if you put some of that fucking da bomb stuff, you ever have that stuff? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=676.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Ari gave me a bottle of that stuff. It's ridiculous. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=680.0s)]
*  I don't play it. I don't play it. It's so hot. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=682.0s)]
*  It's like too crazy. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=684.0s)]
*  But my point is a couple of those people scattered around in a city can ruin the city. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=685.0s)]
*  And then if you have an industry that's like almost entirely filled with crazy people like acting, when I meet cool actors, it is so such a breath of fresh air. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=691.0s)]
*  Like, dude, you're so nice. So nice to talk to you. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=703.0s)]
*  You know what they always have in common? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=706.0s)]
*  They had a rough, rough life before they made it big. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=707.0s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of them do. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=710.0s)]
*  A lot of them do. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=712.0s)]
*  A lot of them do. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=713.0s)]
*  Some of them are really impressive. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=714.0s)]
*  And it makes me embarrassed that I sort of dismiss some actors. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=716.0s)]
*  I dismiss them as being insane. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=722.0s)]
*  That's the safest bet, though. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=724.0s)]
*  It is a safe bet. It's like, I mean. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=725.0s)]
*  Because because because an actor that is crazy, if they in your life, it's like they can act so they can lie. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=729.0s)]
*  And they're practicing on you. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=737.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And you would have no idea. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=739.0s)]
*  You know, if Daniel Day-Lewis wanted to lie to your face, you wouldn't be able to tell. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=742.0s)]
*  Bro, when Amber Heard and Johnny Depp were having arguments that they recorded, like this is peak insanity. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=746.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=752.0s)]
*  Two people who know other people are going to listen to this. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=753.0s)]
*  And they're both aware of it because they were told to record their conversations. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=757.0s)]
*  So they're both being very performative. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=761.0s)]
*  And they're both like conning each other. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=763.0s)]
*  My favorite part is Johnny Depp going, don't tell me what it's like to be punched. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=767.0s)]
*  Punched. The way he says punched, I can't. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=771.0s)]
*  I laugh every time I hit. Don't tell me what it's like to be punched. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=774.0s)]
*  Isn't that crazy that she was trying to tell everybody that he hit her? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=777.0s)]
*  But meanwhile, she just hit him. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=781.0s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, yeah. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=783.0s)]
*  It was that like I still I'll never get over that shit. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=784.0s)]
*  But in the way the way everybody just let her slide after that. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=787.0s)]
*  It's weird because if that was a guy that did something about some woman and, you know, tried to ruin her life like that, like he'd be shunned. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=790.0s)]
*  But there's still people that like who was someone tweeted a joke about Amber Heard recently. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=801.0s)]
*  Who was talking about that? Jamie. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=808.0s)]
*  And they get attacked by. Who was it? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=811.0s)]
*  They said a joke that didn't even say her name. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=815.0s)]
*  Right. They were talking about her. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=818.0s)]
*  Yeah. They get canceled. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=820.0s)]
*  No, it was just like it's almost like she's hired like one of those. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=822.0s)]
*  Not I'm not accusing her of hiring this, but there are publicity teams you can hire. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=827.0s)]
*  So like if people are saying bad things about you, you can hire a team and those people will go after anybody who says anything bad about you. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=833.0s)]
*  And it discourages people from talking shit about you. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=840.0s)]
*  But that's but that's probably that doesn't work. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=843.0s)]
*  It doesn't work, but it. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=846.0s)]
*  I guess it lets people know you're not going to be an easy win. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=849.0s)]
*  It also makes the argument muddy because if everybody agrees that she's a psycho, you know, then it's like it's just an echo chamber. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=852.0s)]
*  But if you get the narrative to like fuck you, you don't know what happened before that recording. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=862.0s)]
*  And, you know, he was an abuser in this and that. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=867.0s)]
*  And Amber speaks the truth and she's a woman and she was confused. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=869.0s)]
*  And like, you know what I mean? [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=873.0s)]
*  Like, there's a lot of people that will chime in and say those things. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=874.0s)]
*  And if you're hiring people, if you have like, say if you're a politician and something goes down and everyone's blaming you for some particular crisis, your city has. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=877.0s)]
*  If you have like a marketing team that has a whole social media aspect to it, a propaganda aspect, essentially, you can have a bunch of people arguing for the mayor. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=889.0s)]
*  And he didn't fuck anything up. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=902.0s)]
*  And it's the city council's problem. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=904.0s)]
*  And he warned them in 2014. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=905.0s)]
*  They can say shit that's not even true. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=907.0s)]
*  And especially if they have these weirdo accounts where it's just a bunch of numbers and letters and there's no picture attached to it. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=909.0s)]
*  And you go to them, there's no followers. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=915.0s)]
*  You're like, this is wild. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=917.0s)]
*  Well, I got a lot of shit for my criticism of Amber Heard. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=918.0s)]
*  But it's like, hey, man, I'm not saying she wasn't abused. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=923.0s)]
*  She was dating a crazy motherfucker. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=926.0s)]
*  They were both crazy. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=928.0s)]
*  But from the evidence I heard, she the only one that sounded like an abuser. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=929.0s)]
*  But that's the only evidence we heard. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=934.0s)]
*  When those two were together, see, you've got to imagine they were together for how many years and how many drunken fights did they have? [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=936.0s)]
*  Like, who knows who did what to who? [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=943.0s)]
*  When you at the point where you, like when the bitch shit on your bed, you've got to get out. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=945.0s)]
*  You've got to get out. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=950.0s)]
*  She's a boundary crosser. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=951.0s)]
*  I got no empathy for you past that point. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=953.0s)]
*  When you've got to start recording your spouse, it's time to go. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=955.0s)]
*  Why even try to win that fight down on the sleeve? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=959.0s)]
*  I think for people like that too, because they're so famous, it's probably very difficult to find someone new. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=962.0s)]
*  You know, you would imagine like very few people could relate to them. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=968.0s)]
*  And, you know, they're both beautiful movie stars too. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=973.0s)]
*  But you can find somebody that's not going to shit on your bed. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=976.0s)]
*  Yeah, I bet you can. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=979.0s)]
*  That's not a low bar to clear. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=980.0s)]
*  It's totally possible. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=981.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=983.0s)]
*  Yeah, because I don't need, I don't need, like if you ever show me that you're going to introduce chaos to my life, you're gone. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=984.0s)]
*  I don't got time for that. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=991.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=993.0s)]
*  Yeah, you got to know when. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=994.0s)]
*  How many bathrooms we got in the house, bitch? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=996.0s)]
*  You're shitting on the bed. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=998.0s)]
*  What kind of drugs are they doing? [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1000.0s)]
*  Oh, man. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1002.0s)]
*  Probably the best. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1003.0s)]
*  You've got to shit your bed drugs. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1004.0s)]
*  The best drugs, yeah. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1005.0s)]
*  For sure. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1007.0s)]
*  I mean, that dude's pals with Keith Richards. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1008.0s)]
*  It's just, you know, publicly to see something like that is so, the thing about it is though, you know it happens. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1012.0s)]
*  You know people are nuts. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1021.0s)]
*  You know people have nutty relationships and nutty fights. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1023.0s)]
*  But until you really see it, like and then see a court case about it on television for the whole world to see. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1025.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1033.0s)]
*  You see like some pretty, you know, what looks like lies, you know, a bunch of crazy talk and you know, just realize like this, these guys were in hell. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1034.0s)]
*  You're thinking of them as movie stars and they were in hell. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1045.0s)]
*  They were in hell and the most psycho relationship ever. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1048.0s)]
*  And I don't even think, I don't even think it was really about the money. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1051.0s)]
*  I was like, I just, I beat you. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1054.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1056.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1057.0s)]
*  Well, I think she ruined his career. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1058.0s)]
*  I think he was getting kicked off of movies because he was being called an abuser. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1060.0s)]
*  And he was trying to say that's not true. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1066.0s)]
*  And she actually used to hit me. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1068.0s)]
*  And then the recordings come out and like, you know, I don't, clearly I don't know what the fuck happened. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1070.0s)]
*  But that guy definitely lost that Pirates of the Caribbean role because of that. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1076.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1081.0s)]
*  I mean, this is my conclusion from all of it because you know the documentary came on Netflix too, right? [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1082.0s)]
*  About it. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1086.0s)]
*  I didn't see the documentary. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1087.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1088.0s)]
*  Is that she is definitely an abuser and he is probably an abuser. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1089.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1093.0s)]
*  So if you put a gun in my head, I'm Team Johnny. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1096.0s)]
*  But yeah, I don't know. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1098.0s)]
*  Also, you got to think that the way he behaves with her, if she's abusing him, is different than the way he behaves if someone's not abusing him. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1100.0s)]
*  But also, man, you've been in a relationship with crazy people. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1110.0s)]
*  It's like they learn how to pull the crazy out of you so they can say, you know what I mean? [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1113.0s)]
*  So it's like if you're in a long, if you were a person like that long enough, they know exactly how to make you act crazy. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1119.0s)]
*  So they can turn around and go, he's lost his mind. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1125.0s)]
*  You know, but for people to act like, oh, it's Eve and Steve. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1127.0s)]
*  I'm like, no, that's not true, bitch. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1132.0s)]
*  She is an abuser for sure. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1134.0s)]
*  This is the way she was talking. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1135.0s)]
*  What you gonna do? [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1137.0s)]
*  You gonna tell people. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1138.0s)]
*  They gonna think you a little bitch. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1139.0s)]
*  Like, who talks like that unless they, you know? [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1141.0s)]
*  Is that what she said to him? [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1143.0s)]
*  Yeah, like I don't know the exact words on the recording, but that was the sentiment of like, oh, Johnny, are you gonna tell people I hit you? [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1144.0s)]
*  And if they believe you, are you gonna tell them you're getting beat up by a little pussy? [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1150.0s)]
*  Like, that's how she was talking to him. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1154.0s)]
*  You got the recording, Jamie? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1156.0s)]
*  I guess I got to try it. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1158.0s)]
*  She's like. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1159.0s)]
*  I get it. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1160.0s)]
*  At that point, you got to leave. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1161.0s)]
*  Yeah, and I don't have no tape from her of him talking like that. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1163.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1166.0s)]
*  You know, I know that's how abusers talk. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1167.0s)]
*  That's how somebody would talk of you if they were like just an abusive parent or anybody. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1169.0s)]
*  You tell anybody and you know what's gonna happen. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1173.0s)]
*  That's how abusers talk. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1175.0s)]
*  I don't hear him talk like that. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1176.0s)]
*  He sound like an abused man. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1178.0s)]
*  She sound like an abused woman too. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1180.0s)]
*  Like, she's saying all the things an abused woman would say, but she an actress. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1182.0s)]
*  So like without the evidence, I'm like, you just killed that role or? [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1186.0s)]
*  The thing is, she's not really good. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1191.0s)]
*  At acting? [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1194.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1195.0s)]
*  She's good. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1196.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1197.0s)]
*  But she's not Daniel Day-Lewis good. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1199.0s)]
*  Well, no, nobody is. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1201.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1202.0s)]
*  So if Daniel Day-Lewis could lie to me, I'd be like, damn, he really is from 1400. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1203.0s)]
*  He got a fucking time machine, Brian. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1207.0s)]
*  I met a guy with a time machine. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1209.0s)]
*  Like, yeah, I couldn't tell. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1210.0s)]
*  Daniel Day-Lewis, Meryl Streep, Denzel. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1211.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's a few of them that could just lie right to your face. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1213.0s)]
*  I don't think she's one of those. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1215.0s)]
*  Nah, she ain't got that. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1217.0s)]
*  But she can dig deep. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1218.0s)]
*  I'm sure she's got some emotions she could pull out. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1220.0s)]
*  Yeah, so I don't know. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1223.0s)]
*  I mean, that's also one of the things that's fascinating about acting is we kind of reward crazy people that are actors because they're really good at it. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1225.0s)]
*  Like, some of the nuttiest people that I've ever met were amazing actors. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1234.0s)]
*  Like, some of them are really good at it and they're fucking crazy. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1239.0s)]
*  I think you've got to be able to tap into, you know, every kind of artist is the controlled crazy. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1242.0s)]
*  It's like you're barely holding your crazy to containing it. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1250.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1253.0s)]
*  Yeah, you kind of got to be a little nuts just to pursue something like that. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1254.0s)]
*  Yes, for sure. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1257.0s)]
*  And then also you're in this industry that at least until recently rewarded people for being insane. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1259.0s)]
*  It was like it's part of the legend of guys like Jack Nicholson are part of the legend of the greats. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1267.0s)]
*  That's also when they had the most fun. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1274.0s)]
*  Marlon Brando out of his fucking mind. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1276.0s)]
*  Remember, he became like 300 pounds, moved to an island. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1279.0s)]
*  Remember, you stop acting totally. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1282.0s)]
*  Well, that's, you know, because now I hear stories and there's like there's a photographer that like took a bunch of pictures in the 90s. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1284.0s)]
*  You know, Hollywood underground, L.A. scene, like people in a club having a bunch of fun because he's the only one with a camera. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1292.0s)]
*  Nobody's got cameras, no smartphones. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1297.0s)]
*  And it was like that was the last time you could have a great time without like just let loose without having people sign NDAs and all of this. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1299.0s)]
*  You can't even throw a party without your lawyer now. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1307.0s)]
*  You can't. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1310.0s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1311.0s)]
*  The temptation, the clout chase is too high. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1313.0s)]
*  What were we just talking about? [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1316.0s)]
*  I was going to tell you something. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1317.0s)]
*  Amber Heard just after that. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1319.0s)]
*  People in Hollywood being crazy. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1321.0s)]
*  Shit, I can't believe I lost it. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1323.0s)]
*  Marlon Brando, Jack Nicholson. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1325.0s)]
*  Marlon Brando. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1326.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, they had a little gay parties. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1327.0s)]
*  Oh, I was watching parties. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1329.0s)]
*  I'm sure he had a lot of that. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1331.0s)]
*  God damn it. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1333.0s)]
*  I forget what it was now. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1334.0s)]
*  Marlon Brando fat 300 pounds. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1337.0s)]
*  Move to an island. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1339.0s)]
*  And that knows it. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1340.0s)]
*  I'm not going to get it. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1341.0s)]
*  It'll come back once you stop thinking about it. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1342.0s)]
*  It will. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1344.0s)]
*  What is that when that happens? [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1345.0s)]
*  That weird thing where your brain just stops thinking about a thing you were just thinking about. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1347.0s)]
*  No, I saw a study, man, and I can't name a study. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1352.0s)]
*  I probably shouldn't quote it. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1356.0s)]
*  Oh, now I remember what it was. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1357.0s)]
*  There it is. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1358.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1359.0s)]
*  This is what it was. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1360.0s)]
*  Marlon Brando, when he won the Academy Award, did not accept the award. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1361.0s)]
*  Instead, had a Native American woman go up there and accept the award. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1365.0s)]
*  And it turns out she wasn't really Native American. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1370.0s)]
*  What? [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1373.0s)]
*  He had Elizabeth Warren accept his award? [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1374.0s)]
*  Yes, Elizabeth Warren went up and accepted his award. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1375.0s)]
*  And her fucking sister ratted her out, I believe. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1378.0s)]
*  It'd be your own people that be hating. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1382.0s)]
*  But she's beautiful. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1385.0s)]
*  And she's probably crazy. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1387.0s)]
*  But if you watch the show, you'll see that she's beautiful. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1390.0s)]
*  But if you find the video, it's kind of funny because like accepting the award for Marlon Brando, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1394.0s)]
*  she goes up and talks about I think she talked about Native American genocide. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1399.0s)]
*  She's a fake Native American. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1403.0s)]
*  She just made it up. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1406.0s)]
*  She just she changed her name like the whole deal. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1407.0s)]
*  What was her name? [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1410.0s)]
*  Did he know? [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1413.0s)]
*  Sashin Littlefeather. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1414.0s)]
*  Littlefeather. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1415.0s)]
*  She just calls himself Littlefeather. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1416.0s)]
*  He didn't know. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1419.0s)]
*  He's Marlon Brando. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1420.0s)]
*  He's on an island fucking everybody that moves. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1421.0s)]
*  So this lady was not Native American at all. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1424.0s)]
*  So the look at the Academy Award. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1427.0s)]
*  What's that? [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1429.0s)]
*  I heard the Wikipedia says she's from Oxnard. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1430.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1432.0s)]
*  And her sister was like, you bitch, you're not fucking Native American. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1435.0s)]
*  Imagine like your sister is crazy and you hate your sister and you're always fighting. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1439.0s)]
*  And then one day you see that bitch at the Oscars telling everybody she's an Indian. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1444.0s)]
*  But yeah, but how she fooled everybody. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1448.0s)]
*  She don't even look Native. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1451.0s)]
*  Well, watch her talk. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1452.0s)]
*  She kind of does. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1454.0s)]
*  She kind of does. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1455.0s)]
*  I mean, she could be. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1456.0s)]
*  Here it goes. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1458.0s)]
*  Seems like I grow to. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1460.0s)]
*  Hello. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1461.0s)]
*  My name is Sashin Littlefeather. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1466.0s)]
*  No, it's not. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1468.0s)]
*  And I'm president of the National Native American Affirmative Image Committee. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1469.0s)]
*  I'm representing Marlon Brando this evening, and he has asked me to tell you in a very long speech, [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1475.0s)]
*  which I cannot share with you presently because of time, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1481.0s)]
*  but I will be glad to share with the press afterwards that he very regretfully cannot accept this very generous award. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1486.0s)]
*  And the reasons for this being are the treatment of American Indians today by the film industry. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1496.0s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1504.0s)]
*  And on television, in movie reruns, and also with recent happenings at Wounded Knee. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1515.0s)]
*  I beg at this time that I have not intruded. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1523.0s)]
*  Wounded Knee was quite a long time before that. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1526.0s)]
*  Why did you say recent happenings at Wounded Knee? [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1530.0s)]
*  There was a protest there. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1533.0s)]
*  Oh, right, right, right. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1534.0s)]
*  So her ancestor dispute here, like after after her death, though, which is kind of. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1536.0s)]
*  Oh, that's what she got busted. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1543.0s)]
*  Her biological sisters, Rosalind Cruz and Trudy Orlandi, who say the family does not have Native American ancestry. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1545.0s)]
*  Keeler writes of the sisters state that their father, who was born in Oxnard, California, was of Mexican descent and had no tribal ties, [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1553.0s)]
*  nor was he related to the Yaqui tribes of northern Mexico. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1560.0s)]
*  Furthermore, Cruz believed Little Feather fabricated a Native identity because she thought it was more prestigious to be Native American than to be Hispanic. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1563.0s)]
*  Keeler searched records for Little Feather's family going back to 1850 and did not find evidence of Native ancestry. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1571.0s)]
*  So she got away with it. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1578.0s)]
*  Damn, Little Feather walked so Rachel Dollazol could run. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1580.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, you know, back then there was no social media. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1583.0s)]
*  Like your friends from college couldn't tweet and go, what? [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1588.0s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1591.0s)]
*  What the fuck you do? [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1592.0s)]
*  You know, that's one of the things that happened with Elizabeth Holmes, that lady who ran that Theranos scam. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1593.0s)]
*  Oh, man. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1597.0s)]
*  Who created a fake voice. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1598.0s)]
*  That's a king scam. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1599.0s)]
*  Her friends from college like, why is that bitch talking like that? [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1600.0s)]
*  They would call each other up. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1603.0s)]
*  Have you heard her on the news? [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1605.0s)]
*  Why is she fucking talking like. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1607.0s)]
*  They got her at a party like totally. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1608.0s)]
*  And then she she gets on the stage. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1609.0s)]
*  We're really excited to bring you the most amazing blood data research from a drop of blood. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1611.0s)]
*  That story is so wild. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1618.0s)]
*  Have you listened to the dropout podcast series? [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1621.0s)]
*  No. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1624.0s)]
*  It's really good. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1625.0s)]
*  It's really good. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1626.0s)]
*  But they made some real good. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1628.0s)]
*  There's some great documentaries on YouTube that are made by like one person. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1629.0s)]
*  You know. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1632.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1633.0s)]
*  That's what I learned about. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1634.0s)]
*  Oh, you mean you can. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1635.0s)]
*  I mean, you can do amazing stuff with your phone today and just edit it all on your phone and upload it to YouTube. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1636.0s)]
*  It's a wild time. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1640.0s)]
*  You ever try that shit though? [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1641.0s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1642.0s)]
*  I'm like these kids. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1643.0s)]
*  My kids do it. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1644.0s)]
*  They have this shit mastered because I try to do it. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1645.0s)]
*  I'm like, wait a minute. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1647.0s)]
*  Did you just spend two hours making a 15 second video? [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1648.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1652.0s)]
*  Like, yeah. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1653.0s)]
*  Yeah, they don't care. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1654.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't got it. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1655.0s)]
*  Yeah, they'll make these intricate TikTok videos that are 15 seconds and I work all day on it. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1656.0s)]
*  But it's just like, you know, I mean, we're we're just we're dinosaurs when it comes to that stuff. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1661.0s)]
*  You know, well, I'm kind of I consider myself tech savvy. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1668.0s)]
*  And I'm not but I'm not really social media literate. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1671.0s)]
*  You know. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1675.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1676.0s)]
*  Because like sometimes like I've had older I've had young people make fun of like the angle that I took my picture from. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1677.0s)]
*  And I'm like, when did the rules check? [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1683.0s)]
*  You know, they told me, oh, you take a selfie like an old man. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1684.0s)]
*  I'm like, what does that mean? [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1688.0s)]
*  I thought you just take a picture yourself. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1689.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's so stupid. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1690.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1691.0s)]
*  And I guess there's a way that old people always hold the camera. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1692.0s)]
*  I guess I don't know. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1696.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1699.0s)]
*  Who cares how you take pictures? [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1700.0s)]
*  That's the weird thing about comedy because I'm because like Derek and Assan are they're two of my closest friends, but I'm like 10 years older than them. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1701.0s)]

*  You know what I mean? So like they always old manning me. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1710.0s)]
*  They're right. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1712.0s)]
*  Well, I'm way older than them. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1713.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1715.0s)]
*  But that's how but that's just how it is. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1716.0s)]
*  But they keep me young. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1718.0s)]
*  Oh, they keep me. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1719.0s)]
*  At least they let me know when I'm when I'm being lame. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1720.0s)]
*  Well, it's always fun to check in on the young generation. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1722.0s)]
*  Like, what what are you guys into? [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1725.0s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1726.0s)]
*  What does cap mean? [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1727.0s)]
*  No cap. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1729.0s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1731.0s)]
*  That means no bullshit. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1732.0s)]
*  Why don't you say no bullshit? [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1733.0s)]
*  Why do you have to have a new word for no bullshit? [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1734.0s)]
*  Well, yeah, because cap because cap could also just mean a lot. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1737.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1739.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1740.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1741.0s)]
*  How did that happen? [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1742.0s)]
*  How did cap become the origination of it? [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1743.0s)]
*  Honestly, I found out from Schultz. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1745.0s)]
*  I heard Schultz talk about it. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1747.0s)]
*  He goes cap. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1749.0s)]
*  He goes cap. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1750.0s)]

*  I go, what are you calling? [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1753.0s)]
*  But that's the thing. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1754.0s)]
*  I was like, but see black people saying cap for like 20 years. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1755.0s)]
*  Oh, so it's like woke. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1758.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1760.0s)]
*  It's like TikTok just like TikTok has shortened the amount of time from when black people [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1761.0s)]
*  say some cool shit and then white people may get lame. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1768.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1770.0s)]
*  Because it's a fucking shorter window. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1771.0s)]
*  It used to be, you know, black people say some cool shit and it would be, you know, [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1773.0s)]
*  pushed to the side and maybe 10 years later, black people would be like, [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1777.0s)]
*  10 years later, black parents are saying it. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1779.0s)]
*  And so now it's lame to the black kids. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1781.0s)]
*  But by that time, the white kids are saying it. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1783.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1785.0s)]
*  And then we already off it. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1786.0s)]
*  And then the white parents are saying it. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1787.0s)]
*  And now it's lame. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1789.0s)]
*  I'm bringing back Groovy. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1791.0s)]
*  Like the bomb. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1793.0s)]

*  Nobody. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1795.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1796.0s)]
*  Who's saying the bomb now? [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1797.0s)]
*  White grandparents. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1798.0s)]
*  In the middle of the Midwest. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1799.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1800.0s)]
*  So it's like, but now, but that used to take like 20 years. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1801.0s)]
*  Now it's like a year and a half because it hit TikTok and it hits everybody. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1803.0s)]
*  You know what it's like? [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1808.0s)]
*  It's like an hourglass, but they just opened up the pipe. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1809.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1811.0s)]
*  The sand flows through quicker. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1812.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1813.0s)]
*  I'll like, I'll have, I'll have people like young people on TikTok telling me like, [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1814.0s)]
*  oh, that's not what that means. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1818.0s)]
*  That is what it means. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1819.0s)]
*  We made it up. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1820.0s)]
*  Isn't that fascinating? [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1821.0s)]
*  Like how quick things change now, like cultural things change. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1822.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1826.0s)]
*  The meaning of fuck boy changed quick. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1827.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1829.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1830.0s)]
*  Because, you know, you know, you know, Ian Edwards. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1831.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1833.0s)]
*  I remember that bit. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1834.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1835.0s)]
*  And then fuck boy. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1836.0s)]
*  And then right under his feet, the meaning changed. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1837.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1839.0s)]
*  Because the kids, you know, and I think he's, I don't know if he still has a bit, but yeah, [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1840.0s)]
*  it's like they're changing it up because all, because what it takes is, you know, sometimes [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1844.0s)]
*  you'll hear, you'll hear a slang word and you'll try to figure out what it means. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1848.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1853.0s)]
*  So what happens is somebody that doesn't know what it means will just assume what it means, [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1854.0s)]
*  be wrong, but popular. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1857.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1859.0s)]
*  And then, and so the whole meaning of it changes. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1860.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1862.0s)]
*  You know, they go viral on TikTok and the next thing you know, they telling you, you [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1863.0s)]
*  wrong. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1865.0s)]
*  You know, the TikTok generation is like, how much attention do they have? [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1866.0s)]
*  Man. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1872.0s)]
*  You're, you're, you're essentially being programmed from the time you're very young to look at [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1873.0s)]
*  something very quickly and just get a little bit of information, move on a little bit of [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1876.0s)]
*  information, move on. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1880.0s)]
*  There's a bunch of people that want to be famous for free. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1881.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1883.0s)]
*  Because they think fame is the prize. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1884.0s)]
*  It's like, Oh no, no, no, no, no. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1885.0s)]
*  Fame sucks. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1886.0s)]
*  Like fame without money sucks. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1887.0s)]
*  You don't want to be famous and broke. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1888.0s)]
*  But you're looking at as a person with talent who has a career. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1890.0s)]
*  What they're looking at is like, Hey, maybe I don't have to get a job. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1893.0s)]
*  Like if I could just fucking dance around in front of my phone. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1897.0s)]
*  You know what kids, y'all, y'all know something. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1901.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1903.0s)]
*  Cause work, working sucks. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1904.0s)]
*  Like, you know, I was just, I was just telling the homies this, but there's, there were, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1905.0s)]
*  I don't remember ever feeling so bad about myself in life until, except for that, the [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1910.0s)]
*  period where I was working my ass off just to make enough to go to work. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1918.0s)]
*  Like I only had enough money to, you know, to eat and go to work and go home and come [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1924.0s)]
*  back and go. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1928.0s)]
*  And even, so even on my days off, I couldn't do shit. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1929.0s)]
*  Cause I wasn't making enough money. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1930.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1931.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1932.0s)]
*  And that if all you can, that's how I know, that's how I know living is more important [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1933.0s)]
*  than working. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1937.0s)]
*  You don't, we don't, you don't live to work. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1938.0s)]
*  You work to live. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1939.0s)]
*  So, so nobody wants to just work. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1940.0s)]
*  If you, cause when you just work, you feel like shit, you want to die. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1943.0s)]
*  All the time. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1945.0s)]
*  But it's the opposite also. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1946.0s)]
*  When you don't work at all, you die in a different way. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1947.0s)]
*  You feel useless. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1951.0s)]
*  You gotta have a purpose. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1952.0s)]
*  You feel useless and you don't get anything done. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1953.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1955.0s)]
*  And you don't grow. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1956.0s)]
*  When you don't have a job, like you don't get anything done because you don't have any [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1957.0s)]
*  money. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1960.0s)]
*  So you can't really do stuff. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1961.0s)]
*  And so you're just kind of at your house all day, just waiting. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1962.0s)]
*  But sometimes, sometimes I'll put it like this. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1964.0s)]
*  I've never been envious of somebody that's being worked to death, but I've walked past [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1967.0s)]
*  some homeless people that laid out on the sidewalk, you know, and I'm like, you know [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1973.0s)]
*  what? [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1975.0s)]
*  It's something to that. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1976.0s)]
*  Just not giving a fuck. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1977.0s)]
*  Like wherever you are, you at home. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1978.0s)]
*  Now, yeah, you don't care about the smell. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1979.0s)]
*  Who gives a fuck? [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1980.0s)]
*  It's pissy out here, but you're comfortable. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1981.0s)]
*  If I had to choose between the two, I don't know. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1982.0s)]
*  I have a tough decision. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1983.0s)]
*  You could always find a public shower. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1984.0s)]
*  The thing is like, it just sucks. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1985.0s)]
*  It sucks being homeless. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1986.0s)]
*  There's no good thing about being homeless, but there's also no good thing about work. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1987.0s)]
*  Like you don't want either or. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1988.0s)]
*  But once you're at the point where you're like, oh, I'm going to go to work. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1989.0s)]
*  I'm going to go to work. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=1990.0s)]

*  But in that wild, like it can go so bad. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2084.0s)]
*  You know a wild fact that I discovered? [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2087.0s)]
*  And this is, you know, correct me if I'm wrong, fans, but I have a theory that, you know, [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2089.0s)]
*  you know how you see crackheads, like they have a funny walk sometimes? [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2095.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2099.0s)]
*  I have a theory that the people that are strung out on drugs, they walk like they still have [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2100.0s)]
*  the ass that they used to have. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2109.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2111.0s)]
*  So like if you see a crackhead lady, like walking funny, picture her with a fat ass. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2112.0s)]
*  And it makes sense. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2117.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2119.0s)]
*  Because she still in her mind looks like crackhead. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2120.0s)]
*  Her hips was trained on her good ass. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2123.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2126.0s)]
*  And now she on crack and then the strength to nothing, but she still got the movements. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2127.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2130.0s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2131.0s)]
*  Let's see if I'm right. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2132.0s)]
*  You know what scares the shit out of me that I've been seeing on Instagram is anorexics. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2133.0s)]
*  There was some anorexic lady who was dancing around on Instagram and then I told my daughter [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2139.0s)]
*  about it and she knew the girl's name, like Eugenia or something like that. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2144.0s)]
*  And is she, is this like- [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2148.0s)]
*  She's a famous Instagram or- [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2150.0s)]
*  Is she famous for being anorexic? [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2153.0s)]
*  I believe that's part of what she's famous for. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2155.0s)]
*  Oh God. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2157.0s)]
*  Because when, you know, I used to do yoga at this place. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2158.0s)]
*  Yeah, there she is. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2161.0s)]
*  Oh no, baby girl, no. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2162.0s)]
*  You should see the video. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2164.0s)]
*  See if you find videos of it. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2165.0s)]
*  Because like when she's dancing around, like that one down there with the microphone in her hand, [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2167.0s)]
*  that's the one I saw. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2171.0s)]
*  Like, look at this. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2172.0s)]
*  That's crazy, man. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2175.0s)]
*  God damn. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2176.0s)]
*  That wig looks like it's wearing her down. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2177.0s)]
*  Bro, that scares the shit out of me. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2179.0s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2182.0s)]
*  Damn. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2183.0s)]
*  Look at her hips. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2184.0s)]
*  Look at the bones in her hips. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2185.0s)]
*  I mean, I used to do yoga with this lady who was anorexic. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2187.0s)]
*  She, I shouldn't say used to do, I did it once. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2192.0s)]
*  I showed up at this class and this lady was there. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2195.0s)]
*  And you know, at the beginning of the class, like before the class starts, people are like warming up and stuff. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2198.0s)]
*  And I look over and I had to do one of these like, like don't, don't freak out. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2203.0s)]
*  Because she was like 70 pounds. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2210.0s)]
*  She looked like that lady. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2213.0s)]
*  But she was like right next to me on the mat right next to me. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2214.0s)]
*  I was like, oh my God. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2216.0s)]
*  Is she doing jujitsu? [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2217.0s)]
*  No, no, no, yoga. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2218.0s)]
*  Oh, oh. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2219.0s)]
*  I was going to say, get her out of there. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2220.0s)]
*  Oh, just let her tap me. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2223.0s)]
*  Just go ahead, get me. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2224.0s)]
*  Oh, shit. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2226.0s)]
*  No, shoot, this poor lady. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2227.0s)]
*  She made me so sad. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2228.0s)]
*  It was so sad. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2230.0s)]
*  It was so sad because she doesn't, you could fix that with food. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2231.0s)]
*  Like you, you're at yoga class. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2234.0s)]
*  You're not poor. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2237.0s)]
*  That's why, that's way more alarming than like morbid obesity. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2238.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2241.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2242.0s)]
*  It's weird. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2243.0s)]
*  Because that's, it seems like an easier fix. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2244.0s)]
*  But I think we have to realize, this is really important. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2245.0s)]
*  We have to realize that, you know, when we judge people like that lady or like even like, [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2248.0s)]
*  you know, someone who's morbidly obese, like Lizzo or something like that. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2252.0s)]
*  If you, she's not morbidly, right? [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2257.0s)]
*  Is she? [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2259.0s)]
*  No, but I would just sit here thinking, damn, I'm glad he didn't say Lizzo. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2260.0s)]
*  That's the easy way to go. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2264.0s)]
*  Because everybody always goes Lizzo. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2266.0s)]
*  Tim Dillon. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2268.0s)]
*  Let's say Tim Dillon. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2269.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2275.0s)]
*  It's, I think what we have to really think about, and I never used to think about this when I was younger, [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2276.0s)]
*  because I was a hard ass. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2281.0s)]
*  I think you have to really understand that like there's something wrong. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2283.0s)]
*  There's something wrong. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2287.0s)]
*  Just like there's something wrong when someone thinks that demons are talking to them. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2288.0s)]
*  Just like there's something wrong when someone can't stop gambling. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2292.0s)]
*  There's something wrong when someone is starving themselves to death [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2296.0s)]
*  and they don't realize that it looks insane. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2301.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2304.0s)]
*  Like there's something wrong. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2305.0s)]
*  It's like with bodybuilders that never feel like they're big enough. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2306.0s)]
*  You know, you know, that's a thing. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2309.0s)]
*  It's like body dysmorphia. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2311.0s)]
*  Yes, it's body dysmorphia. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2312.0s)]
*  When you look in the mirror, you don't see what everybody else sees. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2313.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2315.0s)]
*  And I think that it's not even just that they don't see it. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2316.0s)]
*  It's just like they don't have control of what's happening. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2319.0s)]
*  There's a bunch of factors and everyone's like, oh, you've got control. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2323.0s)]
*  You can go, right. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2326.0s)]
*  You do if you are at your best. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2327.0s)]
*  If you were captured by the Viet Cong and fucking tortured for three years, [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2330.0s)]
*  do you think you'd be the same person? [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2334.0s)]
*  You wouldn't be. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2336.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2337.0s)]
*  And if you lived some horrific life filled with physical and sexual abuse [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2338.0s)]
*  and violence and crime and incarceration. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2343.0s)]
*  Or not even that. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2347.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2348.0s)]
*  Sometimes it's one thing. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2349.0s)]
*  One traumatic event can fuck your whole shit up. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2351.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2353.0s)]
*  And all the point is there's so many factors that lead to a person starving [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2354.0s)]
*  themselves to death on TikTok. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2360.0s)]
*  Like it's not as simple as that girl just needs to eat. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2362.0s)]
*  It's like that there's a problem and the problem is showing itself as a skeleton. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2365.0s)]
*  But the pro there's a lot of problems. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2372.0s)]
*  It's not as simple as like she doesn't know what she looks like. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2375.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2379.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2380.0s)]
*  There's something dark there. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2381.0s)]
*  So fuck. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2382.0s)]
*  This is going to fuck me. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2383.0s)]
*  It's going to haunt me. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2384.0s)]
*  Is she famous for being the anorexic girl? [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2385.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2388.0s)]
*  I just saw that video and I brought it up to my daughter. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2389.0s)]
*  My daughter knew her name. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2391.0s)]
*  She knew who she was. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2393.0s)]
*  And she pulled up videos and she was like, it's so sad. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2394.0s)]
*  I was like, it is sad. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2397.0s)]
*  And she doesn't know that it looks terrible. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2399.0s)]
*  Especially because like I'm pretty sure when your body fat percentage drops to a [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2401.0s)]
*  certain like it's life threatening. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2406.0s)]
*  Oh, she's 100 percent. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2408.0s)]
*  Life threatening. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2410.0s)]
*  Dude, it's it's life threatening for sure. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2411.0s)]
*  Starvation is one of the absolute worst things that can happen in your body because [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2414.0s)]
*  your body starts to digest itself. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2418.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2420.0s)]
*  You know, you never hear the body positive movement. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2421.0s)]
*  It's never like just because she's that skinny don't mean she ain't healthy. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2425.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2429.0s)]
*  No, that basically about to die. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2430.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2431.0s)]
*  There's no body positivity movement for not eating. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2432.0s)]
*  No, hell no. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2435.0s)]
*  According to Wikipedia, this is how you eat. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2436.0s)]
*  No, hell no. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2438.0s)]
*  According to Wikipedia, this is her first video that went viral on like 10 years ago [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2439.0s)]
*  on World Star Hip Hop. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2443.0s)]
*  OK, so then she looks just thin. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2444.0s)]
*  Yeah, but she she looks like her mom and dad probably like you need to eat, baby. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2446.0s)]
*  That's that's what is not an emergency. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2450.0s)]
*  It's she's very thin, but she also looks like she's frail framed. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2452.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2458.0s)]
*  She's a small person. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2459.0s)]
*  Little frame, but she still looks healthy. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2460.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2462.0s)]
*  The between that and what she's at now. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2463.0s)]
*  Look, you could see like her legs. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2465.0s)]
*  She's got these bones poking out everywhere. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2467.0s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2470.0s)]
*  It's a mental illness, man. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2471.0s)]
*  I mean, it's 100 percent mental illness. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2472.0s)]
*  Especially when you know, when you when you got a twerk from the knees, play that. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2474.0s)]
*  She's twerking from the knees. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2478.0s)]
*  Well, she doesn't have a lot to work with. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2480.0s)]
*  No, no. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2483.0s)]
*  I mean, she's a tiny lady. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2484.0s)]
*  She's so frail. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2486.0s)]
*  But to see her like that, like it's just any animal. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2488.0s)]
*  Like I said, that lady who just take yoga was like watching her do it was just like, [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2492.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2496.0s)]
*  Yeah, because how do you how do you cure anorexia? [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2497.0s)]
*  Is it just like, is it like has anyone cured it? [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2499.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2502.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2503.0s)]
*  People have bounced back from it. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2504.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2505.0s)]
*  I don't know what they have to do to bounce back from it. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2506.0s)]
*  And maybe, you know, I think a lot of gets exacerbated by, you know, models like they [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2508.0s)]
*  have to they have to starve themselves. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2514.0s)]
*  When your relationship with food is compromised, I think that might be the most dangerous. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2516.0s)]
*  Like even the opposite, like food addiction. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2522.0s)]
*  It's like when you're when your drug is food. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2524.0s)]
*  Yeah, that feels like such a. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2527.0s)]
*  Because you can't quit food. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2531.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2533.0s)]
*  You know, it's almost like if you had to do a little heroin every day and you have heroin [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2534.0s)]
*  problem, you know, you got to eat. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2537.0s)]
*  So you have to it's the only addiction that you can't ever just abstain from. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2539.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2544.0s)]
*  Right. So that's that's tough. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2545.0s)]
*  But then what is this? [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2546.0s)]
*  Is it like is it like the signal? [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2548.0s)]
*  Like something's fucked up with the chain of events that happen when you put food in [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2550.0s)]
*  your mouth. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2555.0s)]
*  We're like your body instead of being like, oh, that's great. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2556.0s)]
*  It's like, get the fuck out of me. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2558.0s)]
*  I think for this lady, I mean, who knows what what led her down to being a skeleton. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2560.0s)]
*  But it's like they think that thinner is better. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2565.0s)]
*  Just like when when women have like crazy implants or like just super gigantic, super [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2569.0s)]
*  gigantic triple Z. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2574.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2576.0s)]
*  Like big old knockers. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2577.0s)]
*  Like what are you doing? [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2578.0s)]
*  Like what are you doing? [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2579.0s)]
*  You know, they don't see it. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2580.0s)]
*  They want a bigger. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2581.0s)]
*  They want a bigger. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2582.0s)]
*  It's like it becomes some crazy plastic surgery reveals so much. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2583.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2588.0s)]
*  It's like, do you because the big one now is like the lip injections and you see some [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2589.0s)]
*  people like, you know, that don't look right. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2593.0s)]
*  You know, you got stung by a bee on your lip. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2596.0s)]
*  Well, it's your face has symmetry to it. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2598.0s)]
*  There's like a certain ratio to like the distance between the eyes and the length of the nose [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2601.0s)]
*  and where the chin is. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2607.0s)]
*  And when one of those things is off, your brain is going, why is your nose so little? [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2608.0s)]
*  But also, like, there's wrinkles on your bottom lip. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2612.0s)]
*  So when you get too much of a lip injection, it looks smooth. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2615.0s)]
*  Your lip looks smooth. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2618.0s)]
*  So it looks swollen. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2619.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2620.0s)]
*  You know, and even though somebody might look at your face and not notice what's off, they [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2621.0s)]
*  notice they know something's off. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2625.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2626.0s)]
*  You know, right. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2627.0s)]
*  Why your lips smooth? [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2628.0s)]
*  That's weird. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2629.0s)]
*  So shiny and stretched. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2630.0s)]
*  I never thought of that part. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2634.0s)]
*  Yeah, it looks weird to me. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2636.0s)]
*  The lip thing doesn't work. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2637.0s)]
*  It's like we went for boobs and they're like, OK, what about lips? [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2639.0s)]
*  Let's try lips. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2643.0s)]
*  Everybody likes full lips. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2644.0s)]
*  And they tried it. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2645.0s)]
*  But it's like, that's your face. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2646.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2648.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2649.0s)]
*  But I think you could do a little and pull it off. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2650.0s)]
*  Some girls think they're doing a little bit. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2652.0s)]
*  Some of some people have nailed it. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2655.0s)]
*  But you got to be careful not to get crazy. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2657.0s)]
*  You don't want to be the skeleton lady. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2660.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2662.0s)]
*  You don't want to be obese. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2663.0s)]
*  You don't want to be the bodybuilder that thinks he's small. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2664.0s)]
*  I just feel like if she's been like this for that long, don't they get to the point where [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2666.0s)]
*  they fuck up their esophagus from throwing up so much? [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2672.0s)]
*  I don't think she's eating. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2675.0s)]
*  She's probably barely alive, man. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2677.0s)]
*  When you're that little, I mean, essentially her body has deteriorated, right? [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2679.0s)]
*  Like you're not seeing anything but the bones, all the hip bones and everything like that. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2684.0s)]
*  You don't see any meat. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2688.0s)]
*  But let's be honest. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2689.0s)]
*  She looked like she was having a blast. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2690.0s)]
*  I mean, it's easy to look like that for 15 seconds when you're shooting a picture. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2691.0s)]
*  She probably had to sleep for 11 hours to copy that video. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2695.0s)]
*  She probably has zero energy. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2698.0s)]
*  How's she making money from being an influencer? [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2700.0s)]
*  I guess so. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2702.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2703.0s)]
*  But what product is? [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2704.0s)]
*  None. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2705.0s)]
*  What does she see? [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2706.0s)]
*  Ads, maybe. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2707.0s)]
*  You know, people just like. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2708.0s)]
*  She was for hundreds of thousands of followers. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2709.0s)]
*  She was for YouTuber of the Year in 2020. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2710.0s)]
*  How? [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2713.0s)]
*  I've never heard of her. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2714.0s)]
*  I don't know her. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2716.0s)]
*  YouTuber of the Year. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2717.0s)]
*  Her YouTube might be fire, though. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2718.0s)]
*  It might be. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2720.0s)]
*  Why are we judging? [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2721.0s)]
*  We don't even watch these amazing videos. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2722.0s)]
*  She's got over 2 million followers. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2724.0s)]
*  No, bro. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2725.0s)]
*  I think it's just. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2726.0s)]
*  I think it's the sweepstakes. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2727.0s)]
*  Like people are betting money on when she's going to eat and she just cheeses them every week. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2728.0s)]
*  She just puts the feeling right here. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2730.0s)]
*  I hope she gets better. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2733.0s)]
*  I do too, man. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2735.0s)]
*  I really do. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2736.0s)]
*  That's a sad one. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2737.0s)]
*  How old is that girl? [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2738.0s)]
*  Almost 30. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2740.0s)]
*  Almost 30. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2741.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2742.0s)]
*  When you lose that kind of weight and get that thin, that has to be. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2743.0s)]
*  Let's Google anorexia and its effect. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2747.0s)]
*  Its detrimental health effects on the human body. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2751.0s)]
*  It's got to be horrific because I know weight cutting is fucking absolutely brutal for these [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2753.0s)]
*  fighters, but that's severe dehydration, which is not quite the same thing. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2759.0s)]
*  But they do. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2763.0s)]
*  They get real thin before they do that a lot of times, at least they used to. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2764.0s)]
*  Guys are getting better at cutting just all the water out now. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2768.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2771.0s)]
*  Well, I remember when I, I see, I never got to see it up close till we went to fight week. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2772.0s)]
*  And then I was like, oh damn, like you gotta leave these motherfuckers alone. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2776.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2780.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2781.0s)]
*  Like the day before they look, they look, they look like they just, like somebody just [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2782.0s)]
*  rescued them from something. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2786.0s)]
*  Well, they did. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2787.0s)]
*  They rescued them from death. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2788.0s)]
*  They legitimately are at death's door. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2790.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2792.0s)]
*  This is complications of anorexia include anemia, heart problems such as mitral valve [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2793.0s)]
*  prolapse, abnormal heart rhythms or heart failure, bone loss, osteoporosis, increasing [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2798.0s)]
*  the risk of fractures, loss of muscle in females, absence of period in males, decreased testosterone, [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2804.0s)]
*  gastrointestinal problems such as constipation, bloating or nausea, electrolyte abnormalities [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2810.0s)]
*  such as low blood potassium, sodium and chloride and kidney problems. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2815.0s)]
*  Here's a question. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2821.0s)]
*  What's the ratio of men with anorexia versus women? [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2823.0s)]
*  And how many of the men who have anorexia are gay men? [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2830.0s)]
*  I think, I mean, it might be a problem, but I bet it's very few men have anorexia. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2834.0s)]
*  I bet. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2839.0s)]
*  Well, but I think that's starting to change, right? [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2840.0s)]
*  Because right now people are non-binary. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2842.0s)]
*  No, but no, no. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2846.0s)]
*  But right now Pete Davidson is a sex symbol. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2847.0s)]
*  Pete Davidson and Machine Gun Kelly, like young white women love the, you know, the sick [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2850.0s)]
*  looking. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2856.0s)]
*  Sort of. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2857.0s)]
*  Like the real malnourished looking guys. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2858.0s)]
*  Sort of. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2860.0s)]
*  Until Jason Momoa shows up. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2861.0s)]
*  Well, right, right. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2863.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2865.0s)]
*  Well, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2866.0s)]
*  But what I'm saying is. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2867.0s)]
*  And then your eggs start talking. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2868.0s)]
*  What I'm saying is, got more guys don't mind. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2869.0s)]
*  Because men do what gets them laid. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2872.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2874.0s)]
*  You know, and so it's like, that's all, that's why it's not very many anorexic men. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2875.0s)]
*  Yeah, but they're not going to try that hard. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2879.0s)]
*  To stop eating. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2882.0s)]
*  To anorexia. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2883.0s)]
*  I bet you a lot of men in the model industry are probably anorexic. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2884.0s)]
*  I would think they would have to be fit. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2887.0s)]
*  Because, well, they do, but you don't have to look like her to be anorexic. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2889.0s)]
*  Yeah, the research I'm trying to find says there's a problem. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2894.0s)]
*  There is a lot of, it's just general eating disorder. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2898.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2900.0s)]
*  Is big in men. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2901.0s)]
*  Going to anorexia, I think it's tough to find. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2902.0s)]
*  So overeating is probably bigger in men. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2904.0s)]
*  Correct, yeah, that's why I was even finding. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2906.0s)]
*  The first study, they had doubled the amount of women responded even. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2908.0s)]
*  But it's twice as many men said they had an eating disorder than women. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2912.0s)]
*  Right, but that just could be their addicted eating food. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2916.0s)]
*  Correct, most of it's yeah, overeating. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2919.0s)]
*  So they don't have data on just anorexia? [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2920.0s)]
*  I'm trying to find it and then I have not located it. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2923.0s)]
*  Why don't you Google how many men have anorexia? [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2926.0s)]
*  Just Google that. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2929.0s)]
*  I'm curious just with the numbers. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2931.0s)]
*  That's a surprisingly low. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2933.0s)]
*  It says percentage of anorexics are 25% are men. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2934.0s)]
*  A quarter of anorexics are men? [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2938.0s)]
*  10 to 25%. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2940.0s)]
*  Okay, that's higher than I would think. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2941.0s)]
*  But what's the number of total anorexics? [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2944.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2947.0s)]
*  Say 10 to 25% are men? [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2953.0s)]
*  Is that what you're saying? [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2955.0s)]
*  Do they have to self-report? [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2957.0s)]
*  That's not, yeah. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2959.0s)]
*  That's how they would have to know. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2960.0s)]
*  You'd have to go get help for them to find out. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2961.0s)]
*  So it's out of the sites 20 million women and 10 million men have an eating disorder. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2963.0s)]
*  Males make up 25% of people with anorexia. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2967.0s)]
*  25%. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2971.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2973.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2974.0s)]
*  Because they're often diagnosed later than females. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2975.0s)]
*  They're at a higher risk of dying. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2977.0s)]
*  I think that's probably true of every disease. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2980.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2983.0s)]
*  It also says it's not common in people over the age of 40. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2984.0s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2988.0s)]
*  So it's only common when you want someone to fuck you. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2989.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2992.0s)]
*  I think it's probably just common when the most young impressionable. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2993.0s)]
*  Because once you're over 40, you're like, I don't give a fuck. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=2997.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3000.0s)]
*  Hopefully. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3001.0s)]
*  Hopefully you get to the I don't give a fuck 40s. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3002.0s)]
*  Because there's nothing sadder than someone who's in their 60s and still gives a fuck. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3004.0s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3009.0s)]
*  It's like you wasted, that's the only benefit. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3010.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3012.0s)]
*  This also adds just for men are likely underdiagnosed with eating disorders because clinical assessment [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3014.0s)]
*  tools emphasize a desire to lose weight as opposed to building muscle. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3019.0s)]
*  So they might not. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3024.0s)]
*  I mean, I guess they're asking a bunch of questions and they might ask guys the right questions maybe either. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3025.0s)]
*  Women have a 1.5 to 7.5 to 3 times higher prevalence for anorexia bulimia. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3031.0s)]
*  So bulimia might be more prevalent. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3036.0s)]
*  OK, so wait a minute. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3038.0s)]
*  What's the difference between bulimia and anorexia? [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3039.0s)]
*  Bulimia, you throw up your food. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3041.0s)]
*  You eat and then you throw it up. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3042.0s)]
*  OK, that's why I was talking about the damage of esophagus. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3044.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3046.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3047.0s)]
*  And anorexia is just you don't eat. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3048.0s)]
*  Anorexia is just you don't eat at all. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3049.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3051.0s)]
*  But I bet some people have both. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3052.0s)]
*  Well, I think if you have bulimia, you probably die sooner. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3055.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's also true. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3059.0s)]
*  Men are three times more likely than women to have a subthreshold BED, which is a Beding Disorder. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3060.0s)]
*  Meaning it's significant but does not meet all criteria for an official diagnosis. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3066.0s)]
*  Yeah, overeating. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3070.0s)]
*  Because throwing up all the time. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3071.0s)]
*  And lastly. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3073.0s)]
*  You know, severe alcoholics get that. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3074.0s)]
*  What's the lastly? [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3075.0s)]
*  Fifty to eighty percent of anorexia is genetic. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3076.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3079.0s)]
*  And it's the deadliest mental disease. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3081.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3083.0s)]
*  Anorexia nervosa. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3086.0s)]
*  One in five is a suicide death. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3087.0s)]
*  The risk of death in anorexia is more than double the death rate of schizophrenia. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3089.0s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3094.0s)]
*  Almost triple the death rate of bipolar disease and more than triple the death rate due to depression. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3095.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3101.0s)]
*  The crazy thing is maybe 80 percent of it is genetic. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3104.0s)]
*  That's the wild thing, man. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3108.0s)]
*  See, bro, that's the thing is like a lot of times you got to get healthy enough to get healthy. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3110.0s)]
*  You know, like once you once you got to the point where like enough shit is broken, you know, it's like trying to drive. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3115.0s)]
*  It's like trying to try to try to drive a car that needs a lot of work. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3121.0s)]
*  You know, you have to fix all this other stuff before you can even get to drive it. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3124.0s)]
*  You know, yeah, it's like that's a lot of work to get past that. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3129.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3134.0s)]
*  Once you get to the point where more than one thing's wrong. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3135.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3137.0s)]
*  So it's more genetic. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3138.0s)]
*  Like what's what are your genes telling you? [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3139.0s)]
*  Like if I wonder, that's what's interesting. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3142.0s)]
*  It's like, does that mean that it's prevalent in multiple family members? [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3146.0s)]
*  And is that because of like some other shit? [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3151.0s)]
*  Well, you probably are predisposed to it. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3154.0s)]
*  But then something something in your environment may trigger it. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3157.0s)]
*  Maybe or is it possible that what we're calling genetic is just the same environmental stimuli, the same shitty, abusive family life? [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3160.0s)]
*  Or whatever, whatever it is. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3171.0s)]
*  And it just like transfers down from generation to generation. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3173.0s)]
*  Because like you think in some some ways, like especially when I was younger, I thought like, how would my stepdad think of this? [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3176.0s)]
*  You know, I thought like he thought of things. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3185.0s)]
*  You think about like the older people in your life. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3187.0s)]
*  You think about your family, like how they think of things like you think for yourself, but you're not sure. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3189.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3194.0s)]
*  So you think like, what would my mom do? [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3195.0s)]
*  How would my mom think about? [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3196.0s)]
*  What are they saying? [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3198.0s)]
*  I like these babies just pushing titties away. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3199.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3204.0s)]
*  Genetic. I don't know. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3205.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3206.0s)]
*  So my thought is that like maybe it's just prevalent in many people because they have a terrible family life like depression, like depression is supposedly genetic. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3207.0s)]
*  And I bet it is. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3217.0s)]
*  But is it always genetic because someone has some sort of wrong wiring in their brain? [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3218.0s)]
*  They transfer that on through their genes? [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3226.0s)]
*  Or is it because all the people in the family live these fucked up shitty lives and there's no hope in that house? [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3228.0s)]
*  And everyone who is a part of that is kind of fucked. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3236.0s)]
*  They found two specific genes that do it. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3240.0s)]
*  And that brings it up to a 90 percent chance of having an eating disorder. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3242.0s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3246.0s)]
*  I think your genes just mean you're more likely to get it. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3247.0s)]
*  It's got something to do with your appetite. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3250.0s)]
*  Interesting. So these two genes, ESRRA and HDAC4, increase a person's chance of developing an eating disorder by 90 to 85 percent. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3251.0s)]
*  But this is eating too much, right? [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3260.0s)]
*  This is not anorexia. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3262.0s)]
*  No, no. They studied people with anorexia. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3263.0s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3265.0s)]
*  See, these genes, as well as some of the other identified by researchers, are involved in signaling your brain's appetite. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3267.0s)]
*  Blockages or interruptions in the appetite pathways may impact how a person interprets hunger. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3273.0s)]
*  Oh, so their wiring is fucked up and they're not getting hungry? [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3279.0s)]
*  And linked it to diabetes. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3285.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3288.0s)]
*  Metabolic conditions. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3289.0s)]
*  They study twins. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3290.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3291.0s)]
*  There's links with twins that had it that like to prove some of the family genetic stuff, too. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3292.0s)]
*  That's amazing. So it's some screwy wiring that makes you less hungry. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3297.0s)]
*  But also, like, you should know that here's part of the thing that I don't understand. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3303.0s)]
*  You got to know if you see yourself like that, that something's wrong. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3308.0s)]
*  Why wouldn't you just drink some milkshakes? [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3312.0s)]
*  Why wouldn't you just do something to put calories into your body? [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3315.0s)]
*  You'd have to know that you're dying, right? [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3318.0s)]
*  So there's obviously a mental illness component to it, too. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3320.0s)]
*  Well, yeah, I think it's... [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3324.0s)]
*  It's not as simple as like a gene being off where you're not hungry. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3326.0s)]
*  No, I don't think it's that you're not hungry as much as it is that whatever the normal process is to tell you to go eat, [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3329.0s)]
*  like, your shit screwed up somehow. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3337.0s)]
*  Like, whatever hundred signals got to be passed for you to go eat and like desire the food, something in that chain is fucked up. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3340.0s)]
*  But not only is something in that chain fucked up, but you don't have the rational ability to say, [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3346.0s)]
*  I need to consume food because a person needs a certain amount of thousand calories a day. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3352.0s)]
*  It's screwy, too, because you know my... [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3357.0s)]
*  You know, Burner, Jerry Burner? [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3359.0s)]
*  He was doing wrestling since he was a kid, you know, do all the weight cutting and stuff. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3361.0s)]
*  And it's fucked him up to the point where like he forgets to eat. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3367.0s)]
*  He doesn't get hungry like we do. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3371.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3373.0s)]
*  Yeah, he has to remind himself to eat. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3374.0s)]
*  Like, you know, he doesn't know he's hungry until he starts acting weird. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3376.0s)]
*  He's like, oh yeah, I didn't eat. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3378.0s)]
*  Because he's so...he's been starving himself since he was a kid. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3380.0s)]
*  He's been wrestling since he was a little kid. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3383.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3385.0s)]
*  So my point is... [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3386.0s)]
*  He's just become accustomed to that signal. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3387.0s)]
*  Yeah, so I think like if you have these genes, you're more likely... [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3388.0s)]
*  something in your environment is more likely to... [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3391.0s)]
*  It doesn't mean you're gonna have anorexia, but it means you're way more likely to, you know, depending on what you're exposed to. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3393.0s)]
*  That makes sense. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3398.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3399.0s)]
*  Because I wasn't born with depression. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3400.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3402.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3403.0s)]
*  But something happened and some people are just more likely... [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3404.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3408.0s)]
*  Oh man, thank God. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3409.0s)]
*  Thank God I'm not... [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3410.0s)]
*  Yeah, I gotta be grateful for where I am. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3412.0s)]
*  Man. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3414.0s)]
*  Can you imagine having a fucked up relationship with food? [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3416.0s)]
*  Where it's like you don't want it? [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3419.0s)]
*  Oh, I would rather want it way too much. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3421.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'd rather have to fight that. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3424.0s)]
*  I like...there's a lot of people that I know that are like pretty obese that are food-related. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3426.0s)]
*  That are food addicts, that are fun people. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3432.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3435.0s)]
*  They're great to eat with. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3436.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3438.0s)]
*  They're having a ball. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3439.0s)]
*  Yeah, they're having a great fucking time. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3440.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3441.0s)]
*  It's like, yeah, it's bad for you, but at least you're enjoying yourself. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3442.0s)]
*  Anorexia does not look like you're getting the enjoyment part. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3445.0s)]
*  The thing about like...if you go to like a real Italian restaurant, like, come on, eat. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3448.0s)]
*  They just want to stuff you. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3454.0s)]
*  And everybody's drinking wine and everyone's laughing and having a good time. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3456.0s)]
*  That's how Italians like to eat. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3460.0s)]
*  They go hard. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3461.0s)]
*  And no anorexic is dangerous, you know? [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3463.0s)]
*  Where it's like you can't...no chance of when at least a fat motherfucker can fall on you or grab you and... [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3465.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3470.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's fat people that can fight. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3471.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3472.0s)]
*  Like if you that skinny, you ain't got no chance. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3473.0s)]
*  You have zero chance. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3475.0s)]
*  You have no muscles. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3476.0s)]
*  There's nothing...you're just a skeleton coming at you like fucking Pirates of the Caribbean. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3477.0s)]
*  Like a leg kick might kill you. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3482.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3484.0s)]
*  Snap your femur. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3485.0s)]
*  Oh, you could kill that girl if you kicked her in the stomach. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3486.0s)]
*  Oh. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3488.0s)]
*  100%. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3489.0s)]
*  You could be cancelable for my special come out. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3495.0s)]
*  You could kill a regular person if they just...if like their back was against a wall and you kicked them in the stomach. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3497.0s)]
*  You could destroy their organs. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3505.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, for sure. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3507.0s)]
*  Like a turning sidekick to the body. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3508.0s)]
*  Especially if you get them like right...right. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3510.0s)]
*  No, you would get them right in the fucking center. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3512.0s)]
*  Like right in here. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3515.0s)]
*  Oh, like a Spartan kick? [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3516.0s)]
*  No, you'd use a spinning back kick. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3517.0s)]
*  That's the most powerful kick. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3520.0s)]
*  A turning sidekick it's called. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3522.0s)]
*  It's my specialty. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3523.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3524.0s)]
*  So I'm about to say the ones I've seen you doing videos. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3525.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3527.0s)]
*  Yeah, but most people can't pull that off with... [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3528.0s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3530.0s)]
*  I'm just saying that there's human beings that are capable of killing someone with a kick. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3531.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3534.0s)]
*  You don't see it in an MMA fight because first of all these guys are heavily muscled and generally kicks don't land perfectly flush and your back is not to a wall where you absorb all the impact. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3535.0s)]
*  But if your back was to a wall and there was nothing like a concrete wall, there's nothing stopping the impact and someone like really fucking smashed you, you had a real good chance of bleeding internally. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3544.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3554.0s)]
*  A real good chance of having fractured ribs that go into your lungs and all kinds of shit. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3555.0s)]
*  I'm always blown away, but I see a UFC fighter take one of those kicks. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3559.0s)]
*  Bro. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3562.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3563.0s)]
*  You know what the most painful shit is? [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3564.0s)]
*  The calf kicks. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3567.0s)]
*  And I'm saying this anecdotally. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3568.0s)]
*  I've never been kicked in the calf really. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3570.0s)]
*  Not hard. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3572.0s)]
*  Not like by a UFC fighter in a fight. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3573.0s)]
*  But just getting massaged in your calves fucking hurts like hell. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3576.0s)]
*  These guys are kicking each other in the calf and it deadens your calf where you can't walk right. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3581.0s)]
*  So then you've got to kind of play it off. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3587.0s)]
*  So mostly you move it on your other leg. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3589.0s)]
*  And you see it in guys. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3591.0s)]
*  You see it like right away. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3593.0s)]
*  Like Poetan, Alex Paheta, he's the best I've ever seen. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3594.0s)]
*  I've ever seen. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3598.0s)]
*  He's the best at it. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3599.0s)]
*  The calf kick? [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3601.0s)]
*  Wow, he's so sneaky. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3602.0s)]
*  And Izzy, he got Izzy in the first fight. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3604.0s)]
*  And he was getting Izzy in the second fight with it. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3606.0s)]
*  And Izzy's like, God damn, this motherfucker's getting me again. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3608.0s)]
*  Like right before he cracked him, he was catching him in that leg and he was deadening that leg. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3611.0s)]
*  And that's what fucked Izzy up in the first fight. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3615.0s)]
*  He couldn't get away from him. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3617.0s)]
*  His leg wouldn't move. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3619.0s)]
*  He had kicked his left calf so many times. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3621.0s)]
*  The whole thing was just useless. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3623.0s)]
*  And Izzy's just a great athlete, so he's moving around on it and you can't tell that much. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3625.0s)]
*  What's the worst kick you ever received? [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3630.0s)]
*  The calf kick? [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3633.0s)]
*  No. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3634.0s)]
*  The worst kick I've ever received is the kicks to the body. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3635.0s)]
*  You get kicked in the body, man. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3638.0s)]
*  You kicked in the head is horrible. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3641.0s)]
*  You know, you get knocked out. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3642.0s)]
*  You get rocked. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3643.0s)]
*  Getting kicked in the body, like getting kicked in the liver especially. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3644.0s)]
*  Holy shit, man. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3648.0s)]
*  Your whole body shuts down. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3650.0s)]
*  Being knocked out doesn't hurt, though. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3652.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3653.0s)]
*  Oh, it hurts. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3654.0s)]
*  No, I mean, what I mean is you just wake up. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3655.0s)]
*  You don't feel the pain. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3658.0s)]
*  I'm sure you're feeling it, going through something. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3659.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3661.0s)]
*  But like... [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3662.0s)]
*  Liver shots. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3663.0s)]
*  You remember when Bernard Hopkins fought... [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3664.0s)]
*  Yeah, Tank's a good one. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3667.0s)]
*  Tank's a good one. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3668.0s)]
*  When he hit Ryan Davis in the middle. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3669.0s)]
*  Ryan Garcia. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3670.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3671.0s)]
*  Ryan, right. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3672.0s)]
*  Ryan Garcia. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3673.0s)]
*  Yeah, Gervonta is a murderous puncher, man. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3674.0s)]
*  But I was going to say when Oscar De La Hoya fought Bernard Hopkins. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3676.0s)]
*  Bernard Hopkins, you know, Bernard Hopkins was too big. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3679.0s)]
*  Oscar was past his prime. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3683.0s)]
*  Bernard was still in the fucking... [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3684.0s)]
*  I mean, even though he was older, Bernard was probably in his 40s when that fight happened. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3687.0s)]
*  That's when he was the sharpest, though. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3692.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3693.0s)]
*  Bernard, you know, I asked Terrence Crawford about that, and he said one of the things [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3694.0s)]
*  was probably that Bernard was in prison, and during that prison time, he didn't abuse his body. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3698.0s)]
*  Like, he didn't get beat up. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3702.0s)]
*  He didn't have all the... [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3704.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3705.0s)]
*  But he was training and learning. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3706.0s)]
*  And then he also developed this insane discipline when he was in prison. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3707.0s)]
*  He's like, I am never coming back here. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3710.0s)]
*  I'm never coming back here. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3713.0s)]
*  And they said to him, we'll see you, like, after you got executed. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3714.0s)]
*  You've never seen me. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3717.0s)]
*  Well, that's the thing, man. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3718.0s)]
*  This is it. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3719.0s)]
*  This is... [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3720.0s)]
*  I don't know how old Bernard... [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3721.0s)]
*  There it is. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3723.0s)]
*  There's the body shot. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3724.0s)]
*  Let me see that again. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3725.0s)]
*  Ooh, dinked in the body. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3726.0s)]
*  Bernard was so good. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3728.0s)]
*  I just watched the... [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3730.0s)]
*  I rewatched Bernard versus Kelly Pavlik the other day. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3731.0s)]
*  And I think Bernard was in his 40s in that fight, too. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3734.0s)]
*  And everybody counted Bernard out. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3737.0s)]
*  That was after Kelly Pavlik docked out Jermaine Taylor. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3739.0s)]
*  You can accomplish so much out of Spike. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3742.0s)]
*  Spike? [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3744.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3745.0s)]
*  Just the will. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3746.0s)]
*  So many of the things I've overcome have been from Spike. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3747.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3749.0s)]
*  Yeah, when my dad dropped me... [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3750.0s)]
*  When he dropped me off to go to boot camp, he was like, I'll see you in a couple weeks. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3751.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3754.0s)]
*  And that is what made me not quit. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3755.0s)]
*  I was like, never, never. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3758.0s)]
*  I will not give him the satisfaction. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3760.0s)]
*  Because he was right. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3762.0s)]
*  I had trouble with people telling me what to do and stuff like that. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3763.0s)]
*  But I was like, oh, no. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3766.0s)]
*  Ain't no way I'm going back home. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3767.0s)]
*  No way. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3769.0s)]
*  Fuck no. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3770.0s)]
*  I'll endure whatever just to win, just to show you. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3771.0s)]
*  Bernard was world class when he was 50. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3775.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3778.0s)]
*  He probably still boxed up the average person. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3779.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3782.0s)]
*  Oh, the average person's dead for sure. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3783.0s)]
*  But I mean, that guy, like, what... [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3785.0s)]
*  And also clean living his entire life, organic food, no fucking around, no drugs, no alcohol, no nothing. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3788.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3795.0s)]
*  He was always in shape, always in shape. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3796.0s)]
*  Never got fat, never got big in between fights at all. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3799.0s)]
*  Always running, always hitting the bag, never got out of shape. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3802.0s)]
*  Not for a minute, not for a second. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3805.0s)]
*  You could have called Bernard Hopkins on a Tuesday and said you got a fight on Saturday and be like, how much? [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3807.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3812.0s)]
*  You know? [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3813.0s)]
*  I mean, he was always ready. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3814.0s)]
*  He was just so defensively responsible. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3815.0s)]
*  Like, his defense was impeccable. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3818.0s)]
*  Yeah, he was sharp. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3820.0s)]
*  I mean, Philly produced a lot of... [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3821.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3823.0s)]
*  Philly produced a lot of killers. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3824.0s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3825.0s)]
*  And I don't know why that is specifically. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3826.0s)]
*  Tough neighborhoods. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3828.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3829.0s)]
*  Tough neighborhoods produce killers. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3830.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's true. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3831.0s)]
*  Come on, Brownsville. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3832.0s)]
*  But every now and then, though, you get like a rich kid, like a prince or something like that. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3833.0s)]
*  Oh, a prince not seeing you, huh, man? [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3839.0s)]
*  I don't know if he... [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3840.0s)]
*  Was he really your prince? [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3841.0s)]
*  I don't think he was really your prince. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3842.0s)]
*  No, he was really your prince. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3843.0s)]
*  But every now and then, you get like a spoiled kid that got your hands. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3844.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3847.0s)]
*  Every now and then. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3848.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, there's people that violate the rules. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3849.0s)]
*  Yeah, you get the Ivy League champ. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3851.0s)]
*  But it's so rare. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3853.0s)]
*  Nobody wants that, though. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3854.0s)]
*  They want somebody that's been through some shit. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3855.0s)]
*  They want Tyson. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3856.0s)]
*  Yeah, they want my Tyson. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3857.0s)]
*  They want somebody that came from the depths. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3858.0s)]
*  Yeah, someone with no family. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3860.0s)]
*  Someone who was raised by a guardian who happened to be a hypnotist and also a boxing trainer. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3862.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's Prince Nassim. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3869.0s)]
*  He used to get... [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3871.0s)]
*  This motherfucker. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3872.0s)]
*  He came out of the flying carpet. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3873.0s)]
*  How amazing was that, bro? [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3876.0s)]
*  People forgot about Nassim. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3877.0s)]
*  And his style was amazing, man. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3879.0s)]
*  Watch some of the fighting. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3882.0s)]
*  This is fun, but find some of his fighting. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3885.0s)]
*  Because his style was so crazy. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3887.0s)]
*  He had his hands down by his knees. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3889.0s)]
*  And he would bend at the waist and just wing punches at you. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3891.0s)]
*  He reminded me of... [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3895.0s)]
*  Who was the dude we were talking about the other day that had that weird style? [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3896.0s)]
*  The drunken master? [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3899.0s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3901.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3902.0s)]
*  What was his name? [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3903.0s)]
*  Look at Nassim. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3904.0s)]
*  Look at him dancing around. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3906.0s)]
*  I mean, look at that. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3908.0s)]
*  How do you handle that? [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3910.0s)]
*  And the guy can punch. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3911.0s)]
*  And he had big legs. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3913.0s)]
*  And his power came from his legs. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3915.0s)]
*  He would punch with his whole body. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3917.0s)]
*  And people forgot, man. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3920.0s)]
*  He was really good. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3921.0s)]
*  And he was so popular. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3923.0s)]
*  I mean, he was all over television back then. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3925.0s)]
*  So unusual. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3928.0s)]
*  His interest was too long, though. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3929.0s)]
*  He had like a 20-minute... [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3931.0s)]
*  Oh, no, no, no. It was great. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3932.0s)]
*  It's great because now we can go back and watch it. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3933.0s)]
*  But, dude, he was fucking people up. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3936.0s)]
*  So he had this crazy style, but he also had murderous power. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3938.0s)]
*  I think his son's fighting now. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3943.0s)]
*  Emmanuel Augustus? [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3945.0s)]
*  Yeah, Emmanuel Augustus. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3946.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3947.0s)]
*  The drunken master. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3948.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's him now. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3949.0s)]
*  Now he's just... now he's a heavyweight. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3951.0s)]
*  Oh, Princeton seems a heavyweight? [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3954.0s)]
*  No, he's not fighting anymore. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3956.0s)]
*  He's eating a lot of food. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3958.0s)]
*  That's him on the right. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3959.0s)]
*  Oh, what? [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3960.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3961.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3962.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's one of them 85%. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3963.0s)]
*  He's got that gene. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3965.0s)]
*  For real. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3968.0s)]
*  What is Emmanuel Augustus? [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3969.0s)]
*  Go to Emmanuel Augustus highlights. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3971.0s)]
*  Emmanuel was different, though, because Emmanuel, instead of... [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3973.0s)]
*  I mean, it was a lot of hands down moving around, but it was smoother. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3977.0s)]
*  Emmanuel was like he was dancing with you. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3982.0s)]
*  Like literally dancing. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3985.0s)]
*  And it's like he would throw a punch when you least expect it. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3987.0s)]
*  There was no rhythm to... [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3990.0s)]
*  Floyd said that he was the hardest fighter he ever fought. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3991.0s)]
*  He said the hardest fight he ever had was this guy. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3994.0s)]
*  Because look at how he fights. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=3997.0s)]
*  He's just moving around. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4000.0s)]
*  It's like that dude was dancing before the fight started. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4002.0s)]
*  He was dancing during the fight. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4005.0s)]
*  And he was really slick defensively. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4007.0s)]
*  So like this style was like very disconcerting because he could move so good. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4010.0s)]
*  And he was kind of clowning you. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4015.0s)]
*  So that fucks with your head. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4017.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, if you see somebody... [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4019.0s)]
*  Oh, he would throw a couple punches at me and I'm like, I'm good, man. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4022.0s)]
*  I forfeit. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4025.0s)]
*  I forfeit. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4026.0s)]
*  Well, that's where leg kicks come into play, son. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4027.0s)]
*  Oh, whoomp. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4029.0s)]
*  Give him a couple of those. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4030.0s)]
*  Whoomp. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4031.0s)]
*  Put your hands up. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4032.0s)]
*  Move forward. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4033.0s)]
*  Whoomp. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4034.0s)]
*  A few of those and all that shit's gone. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4035.0s)]
*  That's why it's wild to hear. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4037.0s)]
*  I forget that guy, that bodybuilder that was like... [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4039.0s)]
*  Bradley Martin. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4041.0s)]
*  Like I could beat. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4042.0s)]
*  He was a professional fighter in a fight. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4043.0s)]
*  It's like, come on, man. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4045.0s)]
*  Well, he's also very smart and he's doing this for clicks. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4047.0s)]
*  Oh, he knows. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4050.0s)]
*  Yeah, Bradley's a smart dude. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4051.0s)]
*  I did see him actually spar with a Black Belt Jiu Jitsu guy that was his weight. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4053.0s)]
*  You know, obviously he got fucked up. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4060.0s)]
*  Who did that? [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4062.0s)]
*  Who sparred with him? [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4063.0s)]
*  I don't remember whose name it was, but I just watched it a couple days ago. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4064.0s)]
*  Somebody did spar with him. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4068.0s)]
*  Who is it? [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4070.0s)]
*  I've seen it a few times. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4071.0s)]
*  It doesn't say in the info. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4072.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, look, Bradley is a super athlete. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4073.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, here it is right here. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4076.0s)]
*  I mean, he's a gigantic athlete. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4077.0s)]
*  I don't know who that is he's sparring with. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4079.0s)]
*  Where is Bradley? [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4082.0s)]
*  He's in the blue. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4083.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's in the blue. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4084.0s)]
*  That's him? [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4085.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4086.0s)]
*  Is this a long time ago? [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4087.0s)]
*  No, no. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4088.0s)]
*  This was two years ago. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4089.0s)]
*  He was done recently, I think, but. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4090.0s)]
*  No, this ain't the video I watched. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4093.0s)]
*  So he's it looks on this video like he's just learning stuff. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4097.0s)]
*  No, the video I watched was recent. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4100.0s)]
*  He was getting fucked up. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4101.0s)]
*  He got real humble. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4103.0s)]
*  But again, they weren't in a street fight when like kicks and punches and everything's on the table. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4104.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4109.0s)]
*  But when it comes to jujitsu, at least Bradley's done this. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4110.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4113.0s)]
*  So Bradley has done some rolling. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4114.0s)]
*  And yeah, he's getting manhandled by a black belt, but we all would. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4116.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4119.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4120.0s)]
*  But but at least he's got some grappling experience. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4121.0s)]
*  So I'm assuming he's done that. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4124.0s)]
*  He's probably done multiple classes. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4125.0s)]
*  So he probably has some understanding of positions, probably some understanding. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4127.0s)]
*  He's probably never been in a real like, you know, what it is to me is like people that have never been in the fight. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4130.0s)]
*  What they don't understand is you could do all the fucking training you want to. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4135.0s)]
*  But if you ain't never got hit for real. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4140.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4142.0s)]
*  That's your ability to take damage or avoid damage is most of winning a fight. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4143.0s)]
*  It's a lot. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4148.0s)]
*  So it's like that one, you know, like, like, like, like, like Izzy that can take a leg kick from Poetan and keep fighting. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4149.0s)]
*  Most people don't got that in them. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4157.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4159.0s)]
*  You know, you hit me with one leg kick and I'm out. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4160.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4162.0s)]
*  Out. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4163.0s)]
*  You know, you haven't fought in. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4164.0s)]
*  If you've never been in a fight, you're all you doing is imagining. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4165.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4168.0s)]
*  It's like you don't know. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4169.0s)]
*  You don't know how you're going to react to getting hit and I'm fucking sternum. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4170.0s)]
*  So this is him rolling video. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4173.0s)]
*  Same guy. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4174.0s)]
*  I think he's wrestling the same guy, though. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4175.0s)]
*  Wrestling Steve Winter keeps the truck. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4176.0s)]
*  Oh, he's getting manhandled. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4179.0s)]
*  But that's just to be expected. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4181.0s)]
*  It doesn't matter how big you are. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4183.0s)]
*  I mean, that guy's big, too. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4184.0s)]
*  If you're grappling with a black belt and jujitsu, you're going to get manhandled. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4186.0s)]
*  That's what that guy does every day. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4189.0s)]
*  You know, if you play chess with a guy who's a chess master, you're going to get fucked up. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4191.0s)]
*  I wish I had the money to put up to actually have him do it. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4194.0s)]
*  Oh, he gets triangle. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4198.0s)]
*  MMA fight with Mighty Mouse. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4199.0s)]
*  Well, you don't want an MMA fight because if he picks him up and slams him on the ground, he can fuck Mighty Mouse up. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4201.0s)]
*  I don't know if he would be able to do that. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4207.0s)]
*  Mighty Mouse is so, he's so technical. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4209.0s)]
*  He knows everything. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4212.0s)]
*  But the size difference is so great. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4213.0s)]
*  All it would take was one slip up. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4215.0s)]
*  It didn't get a hold of him and spike him on the ground. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4217.0s)]
*  Yeah, we kind of saw that happen to [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4219.0s)]
*  Rose Nama units got knocked out like that. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4221.0s)]
*  Right, right. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4223.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4224.0s)]
*  And she was piecing her up before that. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4225.0s)]
*  She was. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4226.0s)]
*  She was. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4227.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think she's been, she hasn't really been the same since. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4228.0s)]
*  Well, she broke her finger in the first round of her last fight. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4231.0s)]
*  And, you know, people are like criticizing her saying she needs to go down to 125 and maybe. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4235.0s)]
*  But you can't discount that her finger was broken in the very first round. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4241.0s)]
*  Like, that's a giant factor, man. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4245.0s)]
*  Her finger was fucked up. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4247.0s)]
*  So she fought three rounds against a very, very tough, legitimate flyweight. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4248.0s)]
*  It was much bigger than her. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4253.0s)]
*  The girl looked jacked. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4255.0s)]
*  But Rose, in my mind, is one of the greatest straw weights of all time. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4257.0s)]
*  And that's where she should be. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4262.0s)]
*  Agreed. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4263.0s)]
*  She's amazing at 115. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4264.0s)]
*  I know it sucks to make 115. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4266.0s)]
*  But that's the big fight is if she really wants to keep fighting, she wants to go back down to flyweight is, [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4268.0s)]
*  I mean, there's Tatiana Suarez down there, but Zhang Weili, she beat her twice. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4275.0s)]
*  So she knocked her out and she beat her in decision. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4280.0s)]
*  So they fought twice. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4283.0s)]
*  Yeah, but you know what, though? [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4285.0s)]
*  That's a different Zhang Weili she's going to go down there for. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4287.0s)]
*  Yeah, because she locked in. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4290.0s)]
*  Oh, she's locked in. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4292.0s)]
*  You know, like, and you always, she was always dangerous as fuck. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4293.0s)]
*  But I don't think. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4296.0s)]
*  She keeps getting better. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4298.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4299.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4300.0s)]
*  I mean, I think in a couple years since Rose seen her, I don't think that's the same fighter she fought before. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4301.0s)]
*  Zhang Weili is a tank, man. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4305.0s)]
*  She comes blasting you with kicks and punches. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4307.0s)]
*  Her grappling sensational. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4310.0s)]
*  Ground and pound is vicious. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4311.0s)]
*  She's got a killer instinct. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4313.0s)]
*  I mean, she knocked out Joanna Young-Jaychik with a spinning back fist. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4314.0s)]
*  Like, she's a beast, man. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4318.0s)]
*  She's a fucking beast. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4320.0s)]
*  And I love me some Rose, but I do, too. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4322.0s)]
*  I don't think she want that smoke. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4324.0s)]
*  Well, who knows, man? [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4325.0s)]
*  Like I said, she beat her twice. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4326.0s)]
*  I think if they fought again, you know, if Rose gets her finger fixed and drops back down the flyweight, that's a fight I'd like to see. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4329.0s)]
*  Oh, I'm definitely going to watch. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4337.0s)]
*  That's a fight I'd like to see. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4338.0s)]
*  Because I remember when Rose won the title. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4339.0s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4341.0s)]
*  I was, that was one of the best cards in UFC history. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4342.0s)]
*  You remember that? [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4344.0s)]
*  Three titles changed hands that night. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4345.0s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4346.0s)]
*  It was, Rose won the belt, and then who the fuck else was on that card? [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4347.0s)]
*  It was two other title fights on that card. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4353.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4355.0s)]
*  I remember DC just yelling out, Thug Rose. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4356.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4358.0s)]
*  Thug Rose. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4359.0s)]
*  And that's when I didn't really know much. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4360.0s)]
*  I was just like, oh, I'm picking her. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4362.0s)]
*  She looked, and everybody was like, what? [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4364.0s)]
*  I was like, yeah, yeah. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4365.0s)]
*  And she won. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4366.0s)]
*  I was like, oh, who is this lady? [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4367.0s)]
*  When she cracked Ioana with that left hook, I was like, oh, my God, she did it. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4368.0s)]
*  She beat the boogie man. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4373.0s)]
*  She beat the boogie woman. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4374.0s)]
*  But she was the boogie woman, too, man. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4375.0s)]
*  She was lighting people up. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4377.0s)]
*  If you ever saw, if you saw Ioana and J-Check in her prime, like, you want to see a wild beat down? [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4379.0s)]
*  Do Ioana, J-Check, Juliana, no, who was it? [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4385.0s)]
*  It wasn't Juliana. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4392.0s)]
*  It was, who did she fight? [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4394.0s)]
*  Can I see your record real quick? [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4398.0s)]
*  This was the night that the fights happened. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4400.0s)]
*  Jessica, Jessica Pined. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4402.0s)]
*  That's who it was. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4404.0s)]
*  Go Rosanna, I mean, not Rosanna, Ioana, J-Check. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4405.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4411.0s)]
*  The highlights. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4412.0s)]
*  This is perfect. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4413.0s)]
*  This is when she was the boogie woman, dude. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4414.0s)]
*  Look at that face. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4417.0s)]
*  Look at that face, dude. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4419.0s)]
*  And this is like when she's multiple time world Muay Thai champion who now was in MMA. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4421.0s)]
*  And so you got to see like a level of striking that you had just never seen from women's MMA before. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4429.0s)]
*  When she came out of the scene, it was her and Valentina Simchenko were like, whoa, this is some next level striking. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4435.0s)]
*  Just super technical. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4441.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, her fucking technique was fantastic. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4443.0s)]
*  Stuff, take downs. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4447.0s)]
*  Go towards the end where you really see the beat down. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4449.0s)]
*  So she starts putting it on her. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4452.0s)]
*  She starts putting it on her at the end of the second round. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4454.0s)]
*  Look at this. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4457.0s)]
*  I mean, Jessica Pined just getting battered, just getting battered. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4459.0s)]
*  And Ioana just beating her down. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4463.0s)]
*  Like, look at this. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4465.0s)]
*  I mean, this was this was when everyone's really scared of Ioana because she was just so aggressive and she would talk so much shit and get in your face the way ends. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4466.0s)]
*  And now she sees Jessica's just busted up and she's just piecing her up. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4475.0s)]
*  And at the end, the final barrage is horrific, man. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4480.0s)]
*  Go to the final barrage and she has her up against the cage. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4485.0s)]
*  She just starts on fucking loading. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4490.0s)]
*  She just starts on fucking loading. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4493.0s)]
*  How did the ref not stop this? [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4496.0s)]
*  Oh, there it is. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4498.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4499.0s)]
*  How are you complaining, girl? [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4500.0s)]
*  I mean, she's complaining because she's a warrior. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4502.0s)]
*  She wants to fight, but that woman was the best. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4504.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's like your corner shot threw that towel in. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4507.0s)]
*  Look at her. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4510.0s)]
*  What is she saying? What is she screaming? [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4511.0s)]
*  Has delivered the Polish power. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4513.0s)]
*  The draw away champion. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4516.0s)]
*  She's screaming, who's next? [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4518.0s)]
*  If you're a 115 pound woman, you're like, fuck that. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4523.0s)]
*  Yeah, fuck. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4527.0s)]
*  Fucking smash like that. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4529.0s)]
*  What happened to her, though? [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4531.0s)]
*  She gone? [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4533.0s)]
*  She just retired. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4534.0s)]
*  Yeah, she lost to Zhong Wei Li and then she retired. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4535.0s)]
*  And that was her last hurrah. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4538.0s)]
*  She had a lot of wars, man. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4540.0s)]
*  And those they pay a price. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4542.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, Amanda Nunes just retired. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4544.0s)]
*  She's the goat. She had to retire. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4547.0s)]
*  She said her legs aren't working right. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4549.0s)]
*  Her legs have nerve damage, she said, from kicking too much ass. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4551.0s)]
*  Oh, right. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4554.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, I get that. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4555.0s)]
*  Retire as the goat. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4557.0s)]
*  Don't, you know, like you said, we never get to see fighters really retire. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4559.0s)]
*  It's always too late. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4564.0s)]
*  It's never like early enough. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4566.0s)]
*  There's very few that retire at the right time. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4568.0s)]
*  Very few. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4571.0s)]
*  I don't know any athletes that don't got some kind of long-term injury [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4572.0s)]
*  that's never gone. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4575.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4577.0s)]
*  You know? [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4578.0s)]
*  Especially combat sports. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4579.0s)]
*  Especially fighters, yeah. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4580.0s)]
*  It's just so brutal on your body. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4581.0s)]
*  I mean, you're literally practicing breaking people's bodies. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4583.0s)]
*  And just the practice is brutal. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4587.0s)]
*  So you're getting all this damage just from practice. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4589.0s)]
*  And then you're having cage fights with people that are going 100% trying to kill you. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4592.0s)]
*  Man, that's why every athlete, when you see them in an interview, [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4596.0s)]
*  and they go, yeah, I'm healthier than I've ever been. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4598.0s)]
*  It's like, no, you're not, motherfucker. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4601.0s)]
*  You never, you know? [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4603.0s)]
*  It's like, I know that's what you're supposed to say. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4605.0s)]
*  This is the best I've ever felt. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4607.0s)]
*  No way. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4608.0s)]
*  No way. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4609.0s)]
*  Well, some of them have pulled it off. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4610.0s)]
*  It's amazing how some guys just don't get injured that much. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4611.0s)]
*  It's real weird. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4614.0s)]
*  Yeah, LeBron James. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4615.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, he spends a lot of money, though, on just maintaining his health, [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4616.0s)]
*  just maintaining his like just massages and physical therapy. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4621.0s)]
*  And like he treats his body like it's a pit crew at a race stop, you know? [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4625.0s)]
*  Like he's in a race car and like, beep, beep. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4629.0s)]
*  That's the moneymaker. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4631.0s)]
*  Yeah, take care of that guy. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4632.0s)]
*  He might be the most durable superstar that's ever played any sport. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4633.0s)]
*  Does he very, very rarely get injured? [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4638.0s)]
*  I can only remember him being like, I mean, he's never been seriously injured. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4641.0s)]
*  Like he had to miss a whole season or nothing like that, and that's never happened. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4645.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4648.0s)]
*  And I think the first time he really got hurt for real was like recently in year 18 or something. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4649.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4656.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4657.0s)]
*  How old is he now? [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4658.0s)]
*  LeBron? [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4659.0s)]
*  39. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4660.0s)]
*  39? [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4661.0s)]
*  He may have needed foot surgery in the off season, but I don't think they're going to say that. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4662.0s)]
*  Oh, like they're not going to talk about it? [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4665.0s)]
*  Like he just started getting injured at a time where like most people have had multiple surgeries by now. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4667.0s)]
*  Bro, they probably get him the best stem cells. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4675.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4679.0s)]
*  They fly him straight to Ukraine. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4680.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, bro. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4682.0s)]
*  Like what do we... [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4683.0s)]
*  They fly them to the jungle and knock a child out in the jungle right there and just take their shit. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4684.0s)]
*  I mean, if you're of that kind of resources, like you're a super athlete, the doctors that you're in contact with must be just top of the league. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4689.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4699.0s)]
*  Because if I was a superstar in the NBA, the first thing I would do is call Magnus Johnson and be like, where your doctor's at? [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4700.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4705.0s)]
*  I want them working on every problem I got. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4706.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4709.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4710.0s)]
*  Because remember the whole HIV thing? [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4711.0s)]
*  Nobody had heard of nobody beating HIV before him. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4713.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4717.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4718.0s)]
*  So I was like, that's the first doctor I want to see. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4719.0s)]
*  I wonder what medication he took, if he took anything. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4721.0s)]
*  You know, I think... [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4724.0s)]
*  Back in the day when everybody was taking AZT and dying. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4725.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4727.0s)]
*  Well, I think by the time he had it, AZT wasn't the main thing they was giving you. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4728.0s)]
*  But also I think he had the resources to like mitigate all the side effects. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4732.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4739.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4740.0s)]
*  But I don't know. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4741.0s)]
*  But you know what's funny? [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4742.0s)]
*  It's like my uncle was HIV positive and he lived for a long time. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4743.0s)]
*  Jeff Scott was HIV positive. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4748.0s)]
*  Right, right. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4749.0s)]
*  And that dude, now see that's a survivor because Jeff Scott had it when it was grids. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4750.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4755.0s)]
*  When it was gay related disease. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4756.0s)]
*  The key weapon beginning was a regiment of three or four antiretroviral drugs, [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4758.0s)]
*  collectively known as antiretroviral therapy or ART. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4762.0s)]
*  So it was after the AZT days. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4765.0s)]
*  They told me that the three drug combination was going to save my life and they were right. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4768.0s)]
*  Hmm. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4772.0s)]
*  There you go. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4773.0s)]
*  So why they wouldn't give an answer to everybody? [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4775.0s)]
*  Maybe they didn't have it yet. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4777.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4778.0s)]
*  Maybe it was just like... [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4779.0s)]
*  Maybe it was just super expensive at the time. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4780.0s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4781.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4782.0s)]
*  Maybe insurance didn't cover it. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4783.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4784.0s)]
*  You know what's so funny? [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4785.0s)]
*  Isn't it wild how now we... [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4786.0s)]
*  No one's scared of it. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4788.0s)]
*  It's not that well. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4789.0s)]
*  I still don't want to get it. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4790.0s)]
*  But it's not a death sentence no more. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4792.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4794.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4795.0s)]
*  It's still going to significantly diminish how many people will fuck you though. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4796.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4799.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4800.0s)]
*  Especially if you're honest. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4801.0s)]
*  You got to be honest. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4802.0s)]
*  Yeah, about that one. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4803.0s)]
*  You got to be honest about that one. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4804.0s)]
*  I don't think you got... [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4806.0s)]
*  You know, if it's not a life threatening thing, I don't think you got to be honest about everything. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4807.0s)]
*  But... [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4812.0s)]
*  That was the scariest thing about AIDS is that there's a thing that you get from having [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4813.0s)]
*  sex that could kill you, but you're going to want to have sex. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4817.0s)]
*  So, hell, be careful. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4821.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4822.0s)]
*  Be careful. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4823.0s)]
*  You don't want to die. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4824.0s)]
*  Well, you know, whenever it's the most dangerous to fuck, that's when people will be fucking [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4825.0s)]
*  the most. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4828.0s)]
*  That didn't stop nobody from fucking. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4829.0s)]
*  Nope. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4830.0s)]
*  Not for a second. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4831.0s)]
*  No, that's why it's wild to me when politicians try to... [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4832.0s)]
*  When they try to legislate morality, it was like, hey, you're not going to stop people [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4834.0s)]
*  from fucking. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4838.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4839.0s)]
*  And not only that, you're not going to stop fucking. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4840.0s)]
*  So shut up. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4841.0s)]
*  I told you, Mexico just passed this legalized abortion nationwide. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4842.0s)]
*  Yeah, we were talking about that last night. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4845.0s)]
*  Mexico's ahead of us. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4847.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4849.0s)]
*  In social... [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4850.0s)]
*  Well, also, they recognize an opportunity for tourism. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4851.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4855.0s)]
*  I ain't think about that. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4857.0s)]
*  100%. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4859.0s)]
*  They already have a stem cell tourism. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4860.0s)]
*  They have an Ibogaine therapy tourism. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4862.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4866.0s)]
*  I got to visit Mexico legitimately instead of just the border towns. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4867.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4871.0s)]
*  Mexico is a beautiful place. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4872.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4875.0s)]
*  It's a beautiful place, but it's just like, it's kind of fucked because of America, because [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4876.0s)]
*  of American drug laws. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4881.0s)]
*  Like American drug laws have propped up the cartel just like Prohibition propped up the [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4883.0s)]
*  mob. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4887.0s)]
*  Do you think the cartel is paying lobbyists to keep drugs illegal here? [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4888.0s)]
*  If I was a cartel, I would do that. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4893.0s)]
*  That would be a smart move. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4895.0s)]
*  If you could get a hold of them. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4896.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4897.0s)]
*  If you could call them up. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4898.0s)]
*  My friend. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4899.0s)]
*  That cartel ship... [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4900.0s)]
*  What do we have to do? [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4901.0s)]
*  It blows my mind that we were helping the cartels move drugs into the country while [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4902.0s)]
*  simultaneously enforcing drug's been illegal. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4911.0s)]
*  What's who's we? [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4916.0s)]
*  Who was doing that? [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4918.0s)]
*  I mean, just us as a country. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4919.0s)]
*  Like the CIA was letting cocaine come in. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4920.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4924.0s)]
*  And then, you know, and then, but at the same time, the DEA was arresting drug traffickers. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4925.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4931.0s)]
*  How come? [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4932.0s)]
*  What is that? [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4933.0s)]
*  Jamie, chuck me one of them. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4934.0s)]
*  I think, I think the cocaine was how the CIA was paying for certain stuff because it was [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4936.0s)]
*  money they didn't have to be in the federal budget. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4943.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4947.0s)]
*  Well, that's definitely the case with Oliver North. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4948.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4951.0s)]
*  That was the case with Freeway Ricky Ross in Compton in South Central LA. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4952.0s)]
*  And we found out about it because of this guy, Michael Rupert, who was on the podcast [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4960.0s)]
*  back in the day. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4965.0s)]
*  Michael Rupert was in that documentary, Collapse. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4966.0s)]
*  Did we see that documentary? [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4969.0s)]
*  It's a documentary about the collapse of peak oil and societal collapse because we're so [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4971.0s)]
*  dependent upon fossil fuels. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4978.0s)]
*  It turned out to not be correct, but what he was predicting, but what he was right about [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4980.0s)]
*  was how dependent we are on fossil fuels. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4984.0s)]
*  And he was detailing the supply chain. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4987.0s)]
*  So he's sitting there. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4989.0s)]
*  The whole documentary is him sitting there in this room on a folding chair just smoking [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4990.0s)]
*  cigarettes and just telling you why all these things are a problem because they're all connected. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=4995.0s)]
*  And it's a very compelling documentary. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5001.0s)]
*  Well, Michael Rupert was a narcotics officer in LA and he caught the CIA selling drugs [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5003.0s)]
*  in South Central LA and then exposed it on a hearing on CNN. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5011.0s)]
*  I'd like this big like town hearing. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5017.0s)]
*  You ever seen this? [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5020.0s)]
*  Jamie pulled up. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5022.0s)]
*  It's wild. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5023.0s)]
*  He was a really interesting guy. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5025.0s)]
*  Last time I saw him, he gave me mushrooms. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5027.0s)]
*  How did they catch him? [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5030.0s)]
*  How did he catch the CIA? [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5031.0s)]
*  Well, he was a narcotics officer. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5033.0s)]
*  So he was arresting people for selling drugs. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5035.0s)]
*  Here, play this. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5037.0s)]
*  I am a former Los Angeles police narcotics detective and I work South Central Los Angeles [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5039.0s)]
*  and I will tell you, Director Deutsch, emphatically and without equivocation. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5044.0s)]
*  Can you speak further into the mic, sir? [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5047.0s)]
*  These mics don't seem to be. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5049.0s)]
*  I will tell you, Director Deutsch, as a former Los Angeles police narcotics detective, that [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5051.0s)]
*  the agency has dealt drugs throughout this country for a long time. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5055.0s)]
*  All right. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5061.0s)]
*  All right. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5073.0s)]
*  All right. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5076.0s)]
*  Obviously, that is an answer for a lot of you. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5077.0s)]
*  Now, can you please? [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5079.0s)]
*  I refer. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5081.0s)]
*  All right. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5082.0s)]
*  Now, can you please? [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5083.0s)]
*  I refer, Director. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5084.0s)]
*  Wait. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5085.0s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5086.0s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5088.0s)]
*  So that guy at the table is from the CIA. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5095.0s)]
*  Wait a minute here. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5099.0s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5102.0s)]
*  If you don't like what's going on here, please leave now. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5103.0s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5108.0s)]
*  Leave. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5109.0s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5110.0s)]
*  Leave now because there are others who do want to hear what's going on in this room. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5111.0s)]
*  Will you please take your seats? [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5115.0s)]
*  I will come back to you as we roll back across to the center section. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5117.0s)]
*  Director Deutsch, I will refer you to three specific agency operations known as Amadeus, [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5122.0s)]
*  Pegasus, and Watchtower. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5130.0s)]
*  I have Watchtower documents heavily redacted by the agency. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5132.0s)]
*  I was personally exposed to CIA operations and recruited by CIA personnel who attempted [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5136.0s)]
*  to recruit me in the late 70s to become involved in protecting agency drugs operations in this [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5141.0s)]
*  country. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5146.0s)]
*  I have been trying to get this out for 18 years and I have the evidence. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5147.0s)]
*  My question for you is very specific, sir. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5150.0s)]
*  If in the course of the IG's investigations, Fred Hitz's work, you come across evidence [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5152.0s)]
*  of severely criminal activity and it's classified, will you use that classification to hide the [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5158.0s)]
*  criminal activity or will you tell the American people the truth? [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5165.0s)]
*  All right. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5168.0s)]
*  Do you want to hear the response first from Congressman Julian Dixon and then from the [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5169.0s)]
*  director? [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5184.0s)]
*  The director of the CIA. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5185.0s)]
*  Wait. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5186.0s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5187.0s)]
*  From your, I'm sorry, sir. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5188.0s)]
*  I will allow the director to speak first and then Congressman Julian Dixon. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5189.0s)]
*  If you have information about CIA illegal activity in drugs, you should immediately [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5201.0s)]
*  bring that information to wherever you want, but let me suggest three places. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5210.0s)]
*  Los Angeles Police Department. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5216.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5228.0s)]
*  Now you're playing in my face. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5229.0s)]
*  I am sorry. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5230.0s)]
*  Others want to hear this answer. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5231.0s)]
*  I am sorry. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5232.0s)]
*  Others want to hear this answer. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5233.0s)]
*  It is your choice, the Los Angeles Police Department, the Inspector General, or office [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5238.0s)]
*  of one of your congress persons from this. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5245.0s)]
*  I did that 18 years ago, sir, and I got shot at for it. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5248.0s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5255.0s)]
*  Wait a minute, sir. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5256.0s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5257.0s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5258.0s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5259.0s)]
*  Sir. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5260.0s)]
*  And? [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5261.0s)]
*  Sir. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5262.0s)]
*  You have not gotten the mic yet. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5263.0s)]
*  You are not. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5265.0s)]
*  But wait a minute then. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5266.0s)]
*  Don't speak out of turn. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5267.0s)]
*  Let me say something else. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5268.0s)]
*  If this information turns up wrongdoing, if it turns up wrongdoing, we will bring the [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5269.0s)]
*  people to justice and make them accountable. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5281.0s)]
*  Just imagine you think there's even a possibility that's true. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5286.0s)]
*  If it's true, I've heard rumblings. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5291.0s)]
*  Just imagine, hey, bring it to one of the offices where we have people that work for [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5296.0s)]
*  us. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5301.0s)]
*  Yeah, they'll definitely take care of it appropriately. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5302.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5304.0s)]
*  I'm surprised they let him live. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5305.0s)]
*  Yeah, he was worried about it too. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5307.0s)]
*  See, they know that if they kill you, it makes what you said seem true. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5309.0s)]
*  If they let you live, they can always accuse you of being crazy. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5313.0s)]
*  He wound up taking his own life. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5316.0s)]
*  Where? [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5318.0s)]
*  Where? [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5319.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5320.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5321.0s)]
*  His health was failing him. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5322.0s)]
*  He's getting older. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5324.0s)]
*  And it's just like that life is very, the life of exposing extreme corruption all the time [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5325.0s)]
*  and being right about it is very scary. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5330.0s)]
*  It's a horrible life. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5333.0s)]
*  You gotta be willing to kill him, motherfucker. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5334.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's just a horrible life. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5336.0s)]
*  And to go from being a guy who's a narcotics officer in LA and discovers that and just [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5338.0s)]
*  gets dragged down this rabbit hole. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5343.0s)]
*  Did you see the movie Collapse, though? [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5346.0s)]
*  It's pretty interesting. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5348.0s)]
*  See if you've got a trailer. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5349.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5350.0s)]
*  It's like no CIA agent has gone to prison for cocaine trafficking. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5351.0s)]
*  Weird. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5353.0s)]
*  And that's how it gets here. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5354.0s)]
*  Weird. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5356.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5357.0s)]
*  Weird. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5358.0s)]
*  Yeah, Freeway Ricky Ross, he's been on the podcast a couple times too and he's the guy [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5359.0s)]
*  who was selling it in South Central Los Angeles. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5363.0s)]
*  He didn't even know what he was a part of. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5365.0s)]
*  He was funding. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5368.0s)]
*  This is it. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5369.0s)]
*  The greatest preventable holocaust in the history of planet Earth. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5370.0s)]

*  I've broken major scandals. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5378.0s)]
*  Going out to try and map how the world really worked as opposed to the way we were told [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5380.0s)]
*  it worked. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5385.0s)]
*  Our map has proven deadly accurate. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5386.0s)]
*  My economic predictions, we had it so right. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5388.0s)]
*  In 2006, we said, get out of debt right now. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5391.0s)]
*  Check your mortgage carefully. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5394.0s)]
*  We issued a whole series of warnings. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5396.0s)]
*  There will be nothing like we have ever seen before. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5398.0s)]
*  Everything that we said was going to happen is taking place right now. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5402.0s)]
*  Gold prices, Pakistan, Afghanistan, the stock market. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5406.0s)]
*  It's not that Bernie Madoff was a pyramid scheme. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5409.0s)]
*  The whole economy is a pyramid scheme. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5412.0s)]
*  Of course I've been called a conspiracy theorist. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5417.0s)]
*  But I don't deal in conspiracy theory. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5420.0s)]
*  I deal in conspiracy fact. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5422.0s)]
*  The mortal blow to human industrialized civilization will happen when oil prices spike [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5425.0s)]
*  and nobody can afford to buy that oil and everything will just shut down. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5430.0s)]
*  Unlike the Great Depression, we do not have infinite resources. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5437.0s)]
*  Nothing grows forever. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5441.0s)]
*  There is a cycle. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5442.0s)]
*  Birth, growth, maturation, decline and death. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5443.0s)]
*  Cars don't run. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5449.0s)]
*  Mail stops getting delivered. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5450.0s)]
*  Planes don't fly. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5452.0s)]
*  Law enforcement stops working. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5453.0s)]
*  This is all part of the collapse. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5454.0s)]
*  If you're in a camp and a bear attacks, you don't have to be faster than the bear. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5457.0s)]
*  You only have to be faster than the slowest camper. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5462.0s)]
*  The challenge being faced by the human race now is either evolve or perish, grow up or die. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5467.0s)]
*  You have to believe, not hope, not pray that there's a way out of it and you're going to find it. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5474.0s)]

*  He was. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5480.0s)]
*  He's basically telling you, start growing your own food. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5481.0s)]
*  Find, get something that you could treat water with. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5485.0s)]
*  This is a fragile society we live in. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5488.0s)]
*  That's completely depending on us sucking blood out of the earth to pump everything. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5491.0s)]
*  That's what we're doing. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5497.0s)]
*  We're sucking the blood of the earth that we use to pump water. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5498.0s)]
*  We're sucking the blood of the earth that we use to pump water. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5503.0s)]
*  The blood of the earth that we use to make plastic and jet fuel. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5507.0s)]
*  Silicon. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5515.0s)]
*  We mean, think about all the different plastic parts that are just in electronics. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5516.0s)]
*  Oil. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5521.0s)]
*  Part of the reason why we couldn't really, what a sanctions on Russia didn't really stick. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5523.0s)]
*  We hit Russia with the most economic sanctions that anyone's ever been hit with. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5529.0s)]
*  And it's barely phased in because they sell oil. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5533.0s)]
*  They sell oil. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5538.0s)]
*  They're the number two, I think the number two oil supplier in the world and then maybe number one natural gas supplier. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5539.0s)]
*  And China buys, China needs them. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5547.0s)]
*  And so does Europe. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5550.0s)]
*  Who got hurt most by the pipeline shutting down? [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5552.0s)]
*  At first it was Europe. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5556.0s)]
*  It was Europe? [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5557.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5558.0s)]
*  Yeah, because they... [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5559.0s)]
*  And now are they just buying gas from Russia? [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5561.0s)]
*  Europe? [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5564.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5565.0s)]
*  No, now they're buying, I think their gas comes from us. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5566.0s)]
*  No, that was from Russia to Europe, right? [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5570.0s)]
*  Right. From Russia to Europe. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5572.0s)]
*  Europe was their number one customer. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5574.0s)]
*  And someone blew it up. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5576.0s)]
*  Someone. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5577.0s)]
*  Well, the sanctions made Europe stop buying gas from Russia. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5579.0s)]
*  I don't know who blew up the pipe or why. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5582.0s)]
*  Probably us. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5585.0s)]
*  Yeah, they say it's us. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5587.0s)]
*  That's what Seymour Hersh said. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5588.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, come on. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5590.0s)]
*  We probably blew up that plane too. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5591.0s)]
*  That had the... [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5593.0s)]
*  Progression in it? [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5594.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5595.0s)]
*  You think so? [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5596.0s)]
*  I think so. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5597.0s)]
*  I wouldn't be surprised if we... [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5598.0s)]
*  I mean, it's either Putin or us. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5599.0s)]
*  It wasn't an accident. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5601.0s)]
*  Yeah, most likely. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5604.0s)]
*  And when a guy's about to surge Moscow with tanks and he turns around and goes back, he doesn't have much time to live. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5606.0s)]
*  Yeah, you gotta take that man out. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5612.0s)]
*  Yeah, that guy, he's dangerous. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5614.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5615.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't know what he thought. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5616.0s)]
*  And like, his whole leadership was on that plane, which is also crazy. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5617.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5622.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5623.0s)]
*  It's pretty wild. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5624.0s)]
*  Like, you don't see...the vice president don't fly with the president. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5625.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5627.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5628.0s)]
*  It is crazy. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5629.0s)]
*  Along with the third, fourth, and fifth person in line, they never on the same plane. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5630.0s)]
*  Imagine if both planes went down. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5632.0s)]
*  That's insane. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5633.0s)]
*  Yeah, I wonder, is the vice president's plane Air Force 2? [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5634.0s)]
*  Is that what they call it? [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5638.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5640.0s)]
*  Probably. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5643.0s)]
*  Makes sense, right? [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5644.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5645.0s)]
*  Well, it turns out that Air Force 1 is whatever plane the president's on. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5646.0s)]
*  Oh. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5650.0s)]
*  Yep. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5651.0s)]
*  You know, it's not...I mean, it is a specific plane, I guess. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5652.0s)]
*  Maybe there's two or three of them. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5655.0s)]
*  Air Force 2 is any held...call sign held by any United States Air Force aircraft carrying the vice president. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5656.0s)]
*  There is something absolutely hilarious about Trump's name on this plane. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5662.0s)]
*  Just Trump. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5666.0s)]
*  Oh, he uses the Trump plane for his presidential shit? [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5667.0s)]
*  No, I mean, he does it now. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5670.0s)]
*  I don't know if he flies around the Trump plane now. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5672.0s)]
*  I'm sure he's got more than one plane, too, but he's got a giant ass one, like a commercial plane. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5674.0s)]
*  What's the point of that? [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5680.0s)]
*  He's got a lot of room in there. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5682.0s)]
*  How big is Trump's plane? [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5683.0s)]
*  Isn't it like a 767 or something crazy like that? [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5684.0s)]
*  Trump Force 1 is a 757. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5686.0s)]
*  757. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5688.0s)]
*  Oh, they call it Trump Force 1? [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5690.0s)]
*  That's a big ass plane. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5691.0s)]
*  What does it look like inside? [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5693.0s)]
*  The pictures of the inside of Trump's plane? [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5694.0s)]
*  I bet there's a lot of dudes that compete, like who's got the most baller interior in your private chat. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5696.0s)]
*  Just imagine. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5706.0s)]
*  Imagine eating dinner with Trump. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5708.0s)]
*  He wants his Wagyu A5 well done. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5711.0s)]
*  That's what it looks like. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5714.0s)]
*  Looks like a normal jet. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5717.0s)]
*  It's $100 million? [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5719.0s)]
*  Damn. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5721.0s)]
*  So he's got like a little desk there. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5722.0s)]
*  That's like a just a big ass private jet. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5724.0s)]
*  It looks very nice. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5729.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5731.0s)]
*  Big screen in the back. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5732.0s)]
*  This is Air Force 1. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5733.0s)]
*  Air Force 1's got like a fucking US office. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5734.0s)]
*  Is there really like a pod in Air Force 1 where the president can go in and parachute to the ground? [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5739.0s)]
*  I guarantee there is. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5746.0s)]
*  I mean, maybe it would. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5747.0s)]
*  There's some way. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5749.0s)]
*  Imagine being in the Secret Service knowing you're going to die and you got to get Biden in that pod. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5750.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5755.0s)]
*  Well knowing you might have to go to prison with Trump. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5756.0s)]
*  Like how's that going to work? [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5758.0s)]
*  Who's volunteering for that? [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5760.0s)]
*  You got to spend some of your days in prison because they got to be with him no matter what. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5761.0s)]
*  Even if he's in prison? [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5765.0s)]
*  Even if he's in prison. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5766.0s)]
*  They have to protect him until he dies. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5767.0s)]
*  So if he goes to prison, Secret Service has to protect him in prison? [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5768.0s)]
*  Yeah, for the rest of your life. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5771.0s)]
*  If you were ever president, you get that protection forever. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5772.0s)]
*  Is that true? [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5775.0s)]
*  The Air Force 1. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5776.0s)]
*  Well, the thing is, it's never happened before. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5777.0s)]
*  No president's ever gone to prison. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5778.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5779.0s)]
*  So I think they would avoid sending him to prison just for that complication. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5780.0s)]
*  What's that again? [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5784.0s)]
*  It was just in the movie, Air Force 1. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5785.0s)]
*  What? [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5787.0s)]
*  It was just a thing for the movie. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5788.0s)]
*  Oh, the pod, the escape pod. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5790.0s)]
*  Yeah, like Harry Harrison Ford in Air Force 1. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5791.0s)]
*  But you don't think it's really a way? [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5793.0s)]
*  Because bro, you know what, I just found out there's really another, there's a secret subway system in the Capitol. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5794.0s)]
*  What? [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5801.0s)]
*  Yeah, like the politicians use, the president uses. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5802.0s)]
*  That's why you never see Obama walking from the White House to the Congress. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5804.0s)]
*  He just pops up at Congress because he can just get, there's like a, wow. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5808.0s)]
*  It's tiny too. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5812.0s)]
*  The political elite subway system. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5813.0s)]
*  Yep. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5816.0s)]
*  They must feel like ballers. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5817.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5819.0s)]
*  Knowing you're running the country. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5820.0s)]
*  This is it? [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5821.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's just, it's small and they're like see through carts and they all see each other when they're going from room to room also. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5823.0s)]
*  Was this in House of Cards? [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5828.0s)]
*  I think it has been. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5829.0s)]
*  Yeah, it has been, but also he killed people in the regular subway. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5831.0s)]
*  Yeah, he killed someone in the regular subway, right? [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5834.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5836.0s)]
*  That was a great fucking show. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5837.0s)]
*  It was so good. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5839.0s)]
*  Such a good show. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5840.0s)]
*  And it made you wonder, like okay, I mean obviously this is fiction, but how much is real? [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5841.0s)]
*  How much is accurate? [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5848.0s)]
*  How much of it, this is based on what people know about how psychotic. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5849.0s)]
*  All those things have happened. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5853.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5855.0s)]
*  It probably didn't happen to the people, like they probably changed the names and situations and stuff, but they've definitely murdered people. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5856.0s)]
*  For sure. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5862.0s)]
*  Well, they certainly, I mean if you just think about what they're willing to do in other countries that they know is not true, that's going to cost lives. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5863.0s)]
*  Sacrifice people left and right. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5872.0s)]
*  They don't think about that at all. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5874.0s)]
*  Like if, like when you're talking about like say drone strikes, you know drone strikes are the ratio of innocent people that get killed by drones is like it's crazy, crazy high. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5875.0s)]
*  But you can justify that. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5887.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5888.0s)]
*  So if you can justify that, of course you can justify taking out some asshole. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5889.0s)]
*  Who's causing problems. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5892.0s)]
*  Especially if you really a true believer. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5893.0s)]
*  Like if you really thought that you were right and everyone else is wrong about like the way the direction America should go in, wouldn't you do anything in your power to make sure your vision came to true? [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5896.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5909.0s)]
*  So yeah, they're willing to do anything. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5910.0s)]
*  And some of them just want power, but most of them, I think to them, they genuinely believe. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5912.0s)]
*  Like they believed their bullshit long ago. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5917.0s)]
*  So they genuinely believe that they're doing what's best and the other side is trying to destroy everything. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5920.0s)]
*  So they'll cheat, they'll kill, steal. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5925.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5927.0s)]
*  Especially if you consider how every single ruling class throughout history has done that to their people. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5928.0s)]
*  They've all done it and they've all assassinated each other. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5936.0s)]
*  Like the idea that that stopped now. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5940.0s)]
*  And think about the fact, they want their grip on power so badly that no matter how many signs of dementia and deterioration that are exhibited by Joe Biden or Mitch McConnell or Dianne Feinstein, they just, no one's calling for him to resign. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5943.0s)]
*  No. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5960.0s)]
*  The motherfucker froze up. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5961.0s)]
*  Twice. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5962.0s)]
*  Like how is that acceptable to anybody? [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5963.0s)]
*  It's like if you're having a FaceTime call with someone in bad service. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5969.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5974.0s)]
*  Just freeze up. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5975.0s)]
*  Like Mitch McConnell was getting the update. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5976.0s)]
*  He was like, he was back buffering. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5979.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5982.0s)]
*  He's just really old. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5983.0s)]
*  And then they get the federal doctors that say, oh, it wasn't a stroke. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5985.0s)]
*  What the fuck was it then? [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5988.0s)]
*  It wasn't a stroke. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5989.0s)]
*  It's brain short-turtle. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5990.0s)]
*  It didn't bleed. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5991.0s)]
*  Just shut off parts of it. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5993.0s)]
*  But it was something that means you shouldn't be making major decisions. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5995.0s)]
*  You can go sit your ass down. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=5998.0s)]
*  The face he made. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6000.0s)]
*  Like what kind of hell have I found myself in at 80 years old? [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6002.0s)]
*  What have I done? [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6007.0s)]
*  There's no joy left in my life. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6009.0s)]
*  He's like, I'm not going anywhere. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6011.0s)]
*  The Kentucky Republican said he would finish his term as leader, which runs through 2024, and in the Senate, where he was elected to serve through 2026. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6013.0s)]
*  Of course he is. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6021.0s)]
*  Why shouldn't he? [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6023.0s)]
*  I got news for you, Mitch. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6024.0s)]
*  You're not going to make it that long, bro. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6026.0s)]
*  Well, maybe he wants to die out there. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6028.0s)]
*  Yeah, those freezes are going to get longer and longer and longer. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6030.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6033.0s)]
*  What I'm asking is, at what point do, even if you're on his side, at what point do you go, we can't go? [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6034.0s)]
*  What has to happen for you to be like, he's done? [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6043.0s)]
*  Well, you start looking for other jobs immediately, for sure. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6045.0s)]
*  If you're in the staff, you start looking for other jobs right now. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6048.0s)]
*  I think he would have to do something that not even the shrewdest spin doctor could explain away. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6051.0s)]
*  See, the thing is, though, the problem is, if he's loyal to his party, and this is the problem with a lot of them, you don't want to give up your seat. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6058.0s)]
*  Because then there's another election, right? [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6068.0s)]
*  And then someone else comes in, and that person could be a Republican. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6070.0s)]
*  The thing is, it's another election, but in most states, the governor of the state gets to appoint the replacement senator until the election. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6074.0s)]
*  Really? [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6084.0s)]
*  Yeah, and so Kentucky's one of those rare states where all their senators are on the right, but their governor is a Democrat. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6085.0s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6094.0s)]
*  And I think they're trying to introduce legislation where the governor doesn't get to pick, like the same party gets to choose. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6095.0s)]
*  Because that's what they're afraid of. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6102.0s)]
*  Of course. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6103.0s)]
*  That's why they won't let D.C. be a state. That's why they won't let Puerto Rico be a state, because it's automatically blue. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6104.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6109.0s)]
*  You know? [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6110.0s)]
*  D.C.'s been blue forever. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6111.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6113.0s)]
*  But we don't, when we have a senator, we don't have voting power. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6114.0s)]
*  Because he can't vote. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6116.0s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6117.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6118.0s)]
*  That's interesting. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6119.0s)]
*  Yeah, D.C.'s the only city in America that has taxation without representation. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6120.0s)]
*  Do you think the electoral college makes sense, or do you think people should just be one person, one vote? [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6124.0s)]
*  That's tough. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6129.0s)]
*  Because I understand the reasoning behind the electoral college. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6135.0s)]
*  Because they didn't want the biggest states to just dominate choices for everyone. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6139.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6146.0s)]
*  But I think that's just antiquated now, man. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6147.0s)]
*  Yeah, just for president, I don't even think it should go by state. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6151.0s)]
*  It should just be straight-up popular vote for the whole country. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6155.0s)]
*  Yeah, like when Hillary won the popular vote, but Trump won the electoral college, a lot of people are like, well, that's some bullshit. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6158.0s)]
*  Yeah, but were you only saying that because it was not to your benefit? [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6168.0s)]
*  No. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6172.0s)]
*  No, I wasn't a Hillary fan. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6173.0s)]
*  But I thought about it, and I was like, that is some bullshit. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6175.0s)]
*  Like, if you win more people want you, and we're all together, like, what is this funky electoral college bullshit about? [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6178.0s)]
*  And I get what you just explained. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6185.0s)]
*  It makes sense, but still, part of me is like, the fuck out of here with that. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6187.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6191.0s)]
*  How much did she win by? [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6193.0s)]
*  I think Hillary won by a lot. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6195.0s)]
*  By a whole lot. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6197.0s)]
*  Yeah, like what was the margin of her victory in the overall votes? [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6199.0s)]
*  I think her overall votes were way higher. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6205.0s)]
*  Yeah, but see, the other side of that, though, is too, is like, but if we go to only popular vote, that means the small states basically don't count. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6207.0s)]
*  What do you think it would have been like if she won? [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6214.0s)]
*  I think it would have been more of the same from Obama, but maybe a little more corporate. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6218.0s)]
*  You know? [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6222.0s)]
*  There'd definitely have been less ladies with sock hats screaming in the streets. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6224.0s)]
*  What is the number? [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6230.0s)]
*  Three million. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6232.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6234.0s)]
*  Almost three million. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6235.0s)]
*  She beat him by almost three million votes in the popular vote. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6236.0s)]
*  See, but he won most of the states. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6240.0s)]
*  Yeah, 304 to 227 in electoral college. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6242.0s)]
*  That's kind of crazy. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6246.0s)]
*  Isn't that kind of crazy? [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6248.0s)]
*  It's wild. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6249.0s)]
*  It is kind of crazy. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6250.0s)]
*  It's just weird. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6251.0s)]
*  At the same time, though, the bigger states have the most votes. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6252.0s)]
*  California's 55. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6255.0s)]
*  That's nuts. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6257.0s)]
*  That is nuts. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6258.0s)]
*  California's so dangerous. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6259.0s)]
*  Well, it's the biggest state by population. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6261.0s)]
*  So how many electoral votes you get is based on population. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6263.0s)]
*  Yes. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6266.0s)]
*  So it's like, eh. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6267.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6268.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6269.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6270.0s)]
*  Even in that state, there's a lot of people outside of Los Angeles [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6271.0s)]
*  and outside of San Francisco that are red. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6275.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6277.0s)]
*  If you drive up through Fresno, drive up that area, it's all farmers and shit like that. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6278.0s)]
*  It's a very rural part of California that people forget about. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6282.0s)]
*  I think the thing we really need to change is we need a parliamentary system [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6285.0s)]
*  so that it's not just two parties. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6290.0s)]
*  That's a good idea. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6292.0s)]
*  And also, we need to be able to take corporate money out. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6295.0s)]
*  That's the craziest thing about California. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6298.0s)]
*  Only five countries have a bigger GDP than California, including America. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6301.0s)]
*  Including the one it's in. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6305.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6306.0s)]
*  So we're above France, India, Italy, and Brazil in California. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6308.0s)]
*  United Kingdom is just slightly more GDP than California. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6314.0s)]
*  That's insane. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6319.0s)]
*  There's so many people there, man. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6320.0s)]
*  It makes sense. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6322.0s)]
*  It's just like, what are they doing to that state? [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6323.0s)]
*  What are they doing? [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6326.0s)]
*  Which means the homelessness and the smashing grabs [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6328.0s)]
*  and the fucking defunding the police [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6331.0s)]
*  and the not arresting people for shoplifting and like, what are you doing? [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6333.0s)]
*  Like, what are you doing? [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6338.0s)]
*  Are you guys trying to ruin that state? [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6339.0s)]
*  It's Burning Man. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6342.0s)]
*  The state's slowly turning into Burning Man. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6344.0s)]
*  It's way worse than Burning Man. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6347.0s)]
*  It's Mad Max. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6349.0s)]
*  You know, I visited it there recently. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6351.0s)]
*  You know, it is certain stuff that I miss, you know, [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6353.0s)]
*  because there's a certain feeling and nostalgia about LA. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6355.0s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6358.0s)]
*  You get there and you're like, yeah, this is LA. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6359.0s)]
*  And then after a few, it was like visiting family. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6361.0s)]
*  It was like after a few days, I'm like, okay, I'm good. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6363.0s)]
*  I remember why I left. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6365.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6366.0s)]
*  There's a lot of great stuff about LA. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6367.0s)]
*  Oh, man, yeah. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6369.0s)]
*  But it's just not the same LA. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6370.0s)]
*  The way I describe it, it's like you got an ex-girlfriend. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6371.0s)]
*  She used to be really cool. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6373.0s)]
*  And then you meet her a few years later and she's on meth [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6374.0s)]
*  and she works for the cartel. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6377.0s)]
*  What happened? [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6379.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6380.0s)]
*  What are you doing? [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6381.0s)]
*  She's got scars from stuffing coke in her titties. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6382.0s)]
*  She's all fucked up, like, yeah, well, take care. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6384.0s)]
*  It's just... [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6387.0s)]
*  We've all been there. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6389.0s)]
*  It's been, you know, it's been ravaged. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6391.0s)]
*  The city's been ravaged. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6394.0s)]
*  You know, it's just a different place now. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6396.0s)]
*  It's a different place. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6398.0s)]
*  And I don't know what the fuck is ever going to turn that around [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6400.0s)]
*  other than some radical shifts in the way they run the government [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6403.0s)]
*  and then massive uptick in doing something to mitigate crime. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6406.0s)]
*  You have to do something in the community with police. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6411.0s)]
*  They really have to go over how they're spending their money. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6414.0s)]
*  Yeah, that too. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6416.0s)]
*  Like, how come you guys haven't done jack shit about this homeless problem? [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6418.0s)]
*  Like, where's that money going? [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6422.0s)]
*  Because there's big business in there. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6424.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6425.0s)]
*  That's exactly what it is. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6426.0s)]
*  Yeah, when I discovered... [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6427.0s)]
*  When I was homeless and I was living in that shelter [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6428.0s)]
*  and I discovered that... [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6430.0s)]
*  Because something occurred to me. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6431.0s)]
*  Because there's a certain amount of money they get just from the VA. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6433.0s)]
*  Right? [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6437.0s)]
*  So because it was a veteran's homeless shelter, [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6439.0s)]
*  they get a grant from the VA. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6441.0s)]
*  But they also get money from the state, money from the county, [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6443.0s)]
*  and money from the city. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6445.0s)]
*  And when I found out how much all that money was... [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6446.0s)]
*  And the only reason I looked into it was because the food was shitty. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6448.0s)]
*  The food was fucking terrible. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6451.0s)]
*  And I'm like, wait a minute. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6453.0s)]
*  How much money these motherfuckers getting? [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6455.0s)]
*  I did all the math, and I just estimated all their salaries, [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6456.0s)]
*  like, overproposed, and when it was all left over, [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6459.0s)]
*  it was like millions of dollars left over. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6461.0s)]
*  And it's like... [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6465.0s)]
*  You did this math? [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6466.0s)]
*  Yeah, I did this math. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6467.0s)]
*  Because I was like... [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6468.0s)]
*  Because it was a point where we didn't have proper cleaning supplies. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6469.0s)]
*  We were out of running out of toilet paper. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6475.0s)]
*  The food was like the bottom of the barrel, just gross bullshit. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6477.0s)]
*  And it just didn't add up. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6482.0s)]
*  And then I was told, [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6484.0s)]
*  well, you don't understand the inner workings of nonprofits [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6488.0s)]
*  and all this other bullshit. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6491.0s)]
*  And then right after that, the guy running the place relapsed. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6492.0s)]
*  He came to work fucked up. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6498.0s)]
*  He took the meth that he caught somebody else with. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6501.0s)]
*  Because every now and then they would sweep through the rooms [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6506.0s)]
*  and check for drugs and shit like that. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6509.0s)]
*  And when they caught you, they would kick you out and take your drugs. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6511.0s)]
*  And it was just his drug. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6514.0s)]
*  And he was sitting there like... [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6515.0s)]
*  He came to work the next day. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6517.0s)]
*  I'm talking about gone, Joe. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6518.0s)]
*  Like a completely different person. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6520.0s)]
*  One slip up. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6522.0s)]
*  He was up all night on that meth and tried to come to work like it wasn't shit. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6523.0s)]
*  And we were all looking at him like, motherfucker, you are definitely not you. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6527.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6532.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was crazy. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6533.0s)]
*  And when that happened, [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6534.0s)]
*  then all of a sudden the CEO of the nonprofit or the CFO came by, [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6537.0s)]
*  pulled up in a fancy more Bentley or something crazy. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6543.0s)]
*  And then everything started changing. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6546.0s)]
*  The food got more gourmet. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6548.0s)]
*  All of a sudden they got everybody new beds, [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6550.0s)]
*  like fucking memory foam mattresses in a homeless shelter. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6552.0s)]
*  Because they didn't want it to get looked into any further. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6555.0s)]
*  So they knew when people came around to ask us questions, [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6559.0s)]
*  they didn't want us complaining about shit. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6562.0s)]
*  There's probably no oversight. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6565.0s)]
*  No oversight. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6568.0s)]
*  There's so much money. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6569.0s)]
*  And when you look up that company, [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6570.0s)]
*  they'll tell you, because every nonprofit has to do earnings report, [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6572.0s)]
*  but there's no penalty for the numbers not adding up. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6577.0s)]
*  So you can look up how much money they brought in [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6581.0s)]
*  and how much money was unaccounted for. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6584.0s)]
*  And they don't shut them down for that. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6586.0s)]
*  It's just reported. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6588.0s)]
*  And these guys, millions and millions of dollars is always unaccounted for. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6589.0s)]
*  Nonprofit does not mean they're not making money. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6594.0s)]
*  Well, look what the Black Lives Matter ladies did. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6598.0s)]
*  They went and bought houses. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6600.0s)]
*  Really? [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6601.0s)]
*  Wait a minute, what do you mean Black Lives Matter ladies? [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6602.0s)]
*  You don't know about that? [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6603.0s)]
*  No. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6604.0s)]
*  Yeah, there was a bunch of houses that one of the ladies bought [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6605.0s)]
*  for millions of dollars. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6609.0s)]
*  You got to watch out for people that are catering to you. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6611.0s)]
*  You belong to a certain group. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6617.0s)]
*  Outside of every fucking military base. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6619.0s)]
*  Secret $6 million home has allies and critics skeptical of BLM's foundation finances. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6625.0s)]
*  So a group of Black Lives Matter leaders are facing questions [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6632.0s)]
*  about the purchase of a $6 million home in Southern California. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6636.0s)]
*  It was bought with donations made to the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6639.0s)]
*  The transaction is raising questions about how the social justice organization is using donations. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6644.0s)]
*  There's a bunch of investigations into that. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6650.0s)]
*  And that's NPR too. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6653.0s)]
*  That's not even like a... [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6655.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's not like some conspiracy theory website. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6656.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's real. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6659.0s)]
*  I told you, look, outside every base there's car dealerships and all kinds of shit. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6660.0s)]
*  It's like, for veterans only, owned by veterans. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6665.0s)]
*  They're just there to fuck you over. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6668.0s)]
*  Anybody that's like, oh yeah, you, I'm here just for you. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6670.0s)]
*  You got to be skeptical of them. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6674.0s)]
*  Yeah, you know how we do. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6676.0s)]
*  Everybody's like, okay, let me see what you're going on. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6678.0s)]
*  When you open in that school, I'm going to give you $100 a year for 10 years. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6681.0s)]
*  Yeah, and if you got a loan and you got very little credit, they just jack up your interest rate. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6686.0s)]
*  And you sign off on it because you really want that car. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6693.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, I think I'm about to make that mistake. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6697.0s)]
*  No, you're not. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6700.0s)]
*  No, you're making money, man. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6701.0s)]
*  You should be spending it. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6703.0s)]
*  Have fun. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6704.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I'm going to do. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6705.0s)]
*  You need something comfortable that feels good when you get in it. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6706.0s)]
*  Also, I think the planet's end is like, I'm not going to act like there's going to be shit here in 50 years. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6710.0s)]
*  Yeah, we're in a time of great change, like legitimately. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6716.0s)]
*  I think it's hard to see because we're in the middle of the storm. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6720.0s)]
*  But I think if we could look back on it historically, I think they're going to look back on this time and think, wow, everything within a few decades changed so radically. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6723.0s)]
*  A lot of people are going to die. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6734.0s)]
*  Every time there's a major change, a lot of people die and then the world's different. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6735.0s)]
*  Yeah, maybe. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6738.0s)]
*  This is a different kind of change because it's a change of technology, which theoretically at least would mean an improvement in medical technology. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6739.0s)]
*  When you say change in technology, what are you talking about? [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6747.0s)]
*  The overall shift of technology over the last 20 years with the introduction of the Internet and personal computers, the fact that everyone's carrying around a connection to the Internet constantly. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6750.0s)]
*  That shift, I think when the historians look back on the human race, I think it's going to be like a giant explosion. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6762.0s)]
*  Like you have this graph that's like, you know, at a 15 degree curve and then boom, it just goes straight up to artificial intelligence and fucking robot overlords. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6770.0s)]
*  You know the next big shift is going to be when it's implanted. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6781.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6787.0s)]
*  When you're literally always connected to the Internet. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6788.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, it'll start off with something you wear probably. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6791.0s)]
*  But the really good one, you have to have the operation. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6795.0s)]
*  I mean, people be like, you got the operation? No, I'm still, the wearable's pretty good. [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6798.0s)]
*  Like, listen, bro. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6801.0s)]
*  Like the iPhone 30 is going to be in your fucking skull. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6802.0s)]
*  Yeah, they keep, I mean, everything keeps, you have a new meta has a lot of people. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6806.0s)]
*  The new meta has a new VR headset that's coming out soon. [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6810.0s)]
*  They have a three, don't they? [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6814.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6816.0s)]
*  Have that been announced? [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6817.0s)]
*  Like they keep getting better at these fucking things. They're getting better and better and better and better. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6819.0s)]
*  Have you put one on before? [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6825.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6826.0s)]
*  I talked to Burden and getting one. He was blown away. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6827.0s)]
*  They're dope. Matt Serra was on the podcast and he says he brings it on the road with them and he plays like first person shooters in his hotel room and it's like screaming in his hotel room. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6830.0s)]
*  The reason I stopped bringing it on the road is because the battery don't last that long and it's just another thing I have to remember to charge. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6838.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6845.0s)]
*  But that's going to get better and better. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6846.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6848.0s)]
*  I mean, eventually. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6849.0s)]
*  It'll be glasses. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6850.0s)]
*  I don't know why they haven't done this already, but it should be a separate pack that does all the computing that isn't in the headset that you're wearing on your head so it's not so heavy. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6851.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, the Apple one apparently is doing that. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6864.0s)]
*  The Apple one at least has an external battery. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6867.0s)]
*  But the Apple one has a cable though. I'm talking about because now they're at the point where... [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6869.0s)]
*  What does the Apple one look like? You pull it up. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6874.0s)]
*  And the Apple one has a cable that goes to the back and then that cable is connected to what is she wearing? What's going on in her back? [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6876.0s)]
*  They won't really show it to you. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6884.0s)]
*  They haven't shown a lot. There is a battery pack that's different than the phone's battery pack. It also could be probably connected to their computer. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6885.0s)]
*  Oh no. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6892.0s)]
*  Well, that'll let you get different actions. So like the battery pack is only two hours supposedly. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6894.0s)]
*  So when you're plugged into the computer, you're probably getting a little updated battery or a power battery. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6899.0s)]
*  So it's probably infinite. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6905.0s)]
*  This is iPhone one. Okay. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6906.0s)]
*  Yeah, this supposedly isn't even going to be available for everybody to buy. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6908.0s)]
*  Really? [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6911.0s)]
*  I mean, you'll be able to buy it. I don't mean it in that way, but it's going to be so expensive. I think it's $3,500 and they're not going to make millions of them. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6912.0s)]
*  Amen. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6920.0s)]
*  I bet they're going to sell out quick. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6921.0s)]
*  They probably will and then they're going to make another one that's more expensive. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6922.0s)]
*  You know what? I'm the type of motherfucker that'll pay $3,500 though. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6924.0s)]
*  If you're going to watch movies on that thing, I bet it's insane. I bet that's insane. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6926.0s)]
*  Imagine watching a movie like this. Like you're watching Vikings or some shit. You're watching people hack each other apart like the Northmen. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6932.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6939.0s)]
*  And you're watching that and it's just in front of you. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6940.0s)]
*  And that close to your eye, that could give you the equivalent of very much higher resolution. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6942.0s)]
*  Yeah, higher resolution and I bet the intensity of the scenes is like overwhelming because you don't even see your body. [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6949.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6956.0s)]
*  You're just like in the scene. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6957.0s)]
*  And from what I hear, what Apple's done better than everyone else is the eye tracking stuff. It's crazy. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6958.0s)]
*  Like you can tell when you're looking and you can just do stuff from looking at it. They know where your eyes are in the... [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6964.0s)]
*  Yeah, Marques Brownlee described that as magic. He said it's so cool and works so good. It's like magical. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6969.0s)]
*  Well, you know, they've had that technology for a while with Black Hawk helicopters. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6974.0s)]
*  Oh wow. They have this technology where they put this headset on. Peter Berg was explaining it to us. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6978.0s)]
*  You put a headset on, the headset syncs up with the controls and where you look, that's where you shoot. [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6984.0s)]
*  So that's where the crosshairs go. So you like, you look at an object on the ground, you're like... [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6992.0s)]
*  You're looking through your eyes and that's where the crosshairs go. The crosshairs know exactly what you're looking at. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=6998.0s)]
*  I can't wait. I'm going to sign up. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7006.0s)]
*  How wild. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7007.0s)]
*  I will be the third person that has the surgery. I'm not going to be the first one, but I'll be the third one. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7008.0s)]
*  I will talk to you for six months and then I'll consider it. [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7013.0s)]
*  How are you feeling today, Brian? How are you doing, brother? [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7017.0s)]
*  What's going on? You all right? [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7021.0s)]
*  I get so hype about technology. Oh man. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7022.0s)]
*  Well, it's fascinating stuff. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7026.0s)]
*  When that guy walked in the green room yesterday, I was like, oh shit, are those the BNOs? [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7029.0s)]
*  And he was like, I don't know. I was so disappointed. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7032.0s)]
*  Yeah, he has no idea what kind of headphones he's carrying. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7035.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's almost like seeing somebody buy like a classic Mustang and it's just a commuter car for them and they don't know anything about it. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7037.0s)]
*  They never open it up. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7047.0s)]
*  My dad gave it to me. It's a car. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7049.0s)]
*  Oh right. It's like, oh you motherfucker, you don't know what that could do. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7050.0s)]
*  It's a 68 Mustang. Yeah. Yeah. I just, I get that way. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7054.0s)]
*  But you got to be committed to drive one of those every day. Yeah. You got to be really committed. Yeah. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7058.0s)]
*  They are not reliable. No. That's a fucking 54, 53 year old car. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7064.0s)]
*  Well, none of those cars are. 55 year old car. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7070.0s)]
*  Yeah, none of those muscle cars from back then are really reliable. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7073.0s)]
*  No, not now. Especially not now. But even back then they weren't that reliable. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7076.0s)]
*  I'm looking at some sensible cars right now. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7081.0s)]
*  Sensible? I don't like it. You don't like sensible? [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7083.0s)]
*  No, no, no, no, Brian. We've had this discussion. I'm not interested in sensible. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7086.0s)]
*  Actually, you know what's crazy? Actually, I hate that. I don't want to get these motherfuckers' attention. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7090.0s)]
*  But the hybrid joints now are like, they have real high horsepower. Like it's kind of crazy. [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7095.0s)]
*  Crazy. That you can get, like I was, I test drove a Volvo recharge. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7104.0s)]
*  The S60 and S90. That's a hybrid? It's a hybrid. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7109.0s)]
*  Well, the thing is now all their cars are semi-hybrid at least. So they all have an electric motor of some kind. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7113.0s)]
*  But the plug-in hybrid, yeah, the S6 had like 455 horsepower. Whoa. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7118.0s)]
*  Yeah. And it's a four cylinder engine. Really? Yeah, it's a four cylinder inline. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7124.0s)]
*  Oh, that looks dope. Yeah. You should get one of those. Why don't you get one of those? [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7130.0s)]
*  I'm really thinking about getting one. Let me see that thing. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7134.0s)]
*  I'm thinking about getting one right now. That's dope. That's the last one I test drove. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7136.0s)]
*  That looks beautiful. And Volvos have like a great safety record, right? That looks very good. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7140.0s)]
*  That's a very good looking car. Yeah, but look at the stats. [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7144.0s)]
*  A lot of those Volvos, can you show me some more pictures? A lot of those Volvos to me, they're always like a little, [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7146.0s)]
*  I think if you can, there's a little thing on the in-click. They're very simple. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7151.0s)]
*  Yeah, well I used to think they were kind of dull, but this is not dull. This is a very good looking car. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7155.0s)]
*  No, it's definitely an old man brand. That's a good one. But I'm an old man. [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7159.0s)]
*  Yeah, but what does that mean? I would buy one of those if I was 20. That's a dope car. That's a dope luxury car. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7163.0s)]
*  It just means young people don't think it's cool. That's a Swedish company, right? [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7169.0s)]
*  See look, 455 horsepower. That's crazy. That's a lot. It's a lot for, I mean it's not a lot for cars of today. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7172.0s)]
*  My Tesla has 1100. Oh yeah, that's too bad. My boy was talking to me about this, but remember when like 250 horsepower was crazy? [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7180.0s)]
*  That wasn't that long ago. Like late 90s, it was like 250 horsepower, he's crazy. Now 600, 700,000. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7191.0s)]
*  I have a 1993 Porsche. It's a RS America. So it's like the little hot rod stripped down version of the 911. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7199.0s)]
*  It has no air conditioning, no radio, no power steering. It's less than 3000 pounds. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7209.0s)]
*  And from the factory, mine's a little juiced up, I had it worked on, but it's only 300 horsepower now. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7216.0s)]
*  And from the factory, I think it was like, I want to say it was like 270. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7222.0s)]
*  But you know what else I loved about that Volvo when I test drove it? [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7227.0s)]
*  Because I was thinking about that one, it's a Mercedes I was looking at, but I remember you telling me the button. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7229.0s)]
*  Like just having certain things just be buttons instead of on the touch screen. Yeah, fuck that touch screen. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7236.0s)]
*  Because for me it's like the volume has to be a button. Yeah. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7243.0s)]
*  Changing the drive mode, that's got to be a button. Certain stuff, things that you need to happen instantly, that should be a button. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7247.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. I don't need to go into the menus and turn up the volume. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7252.0s)]
*  And so that's kind of, it's not as flashy as like a Mercedes or an Audi. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7257.0s)]
*  It's undercover. Audis are nice. Have you seen the Audi electric one? I saw one of those the other day. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7262.0s)]
*  Pull that up. That Audi electric one is fucking dope. I'm looking at it. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7267.0s)]
*  That's a dope car. Audi makes a fantastic car. Great handling. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7272.0s)]
*  The driving experience in the Audi is just always great. Yeah. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7277.0s)]
*  They're like BMWs. All their cars are fucking awesome. Yeah. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7282.0s)]
*  What is it called? What's their electric cool... That's it. E-tron. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7286.0s)]
*  Look at that thing, man. That's badass. Yeah. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7294.0s)]
*  When you see one in real life, you're like, oh, that's a sweet car. It's starting at 100k. I ain't got that on me. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7299.0s)]
*  It's only 523 horsepower. Interesting. With boost engaged. Interesting. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7304.0s)]
*  So they probably have, maybe it has a longer range or it's lighter or something like that. What's the range? [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7311.0s)]
*  Look at one of the Mercedes AMG. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7316.0s)]
*  Well, 249 miles. That's low. That's lower than a Duster. Interesting. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7321.0s)]
*  I think you get the most out of the electric combined with the gas. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7326.0s)]
*  Well, you know who made a great version of that? They stopped making it, sadly, is the Acura, the NSX. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7332.0s)]
*  Oh, really? The last one was a hybrid. It was a hybrid turbocharged engine. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7338.0s)]
*  And I think it might have had electric engines on front and rear wheels. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7342.0s)]
*  Volvo used to do that. They took out the supercharger because it was creating more problems. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7349.0s)]
*  It would break more often. It was just one added thing in the chain that could break. [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7356.0s)]
*  There it is. That's the farewell to the NSX. That for whatever reason did not sell that good. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7361.0s)]
*  And I don't know why, because it's amazing. Although I never owned one. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7368.0s)]
*  But I did own the old ones. It only sold 2,548 globally. Wow. That's crazy. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7371.0s)]
*  Yeah, dude. Cars are getting faster and faster. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7380.0s)]
*  But I think it's also like, unfortunately, that brand Acura, it's not associated with the kind of cars that people want. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7383.0s)]
*  That's a dope looking car though, man. Look at that thing. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7392.0s)]
*  It's just not associated anymore with cars that young people who buy those kind of cars want to drive. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7395.0s)]
*  And not just that, but just like, because that's kind of the problem I was running into with the Volvo thing. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7402.0s)]
*  That's a cool car, but for the same amount of money, or for a little bit more money, you can get a Mercedes. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7406.0s)]
*  You can get a Porsche. Right. That's the problem is the status thing too. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7413.0s)]
*  I'm going to buy a $70,000 Acura or a $100,000 Acura when I can go get a $100,000 Benz or a $100,000 BMW. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7418.0s)]
*  I had a watch on once and this dude looked at it and he goes, that's a dope watch. What is that? I go, it's a Seiko. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7425.0s)]
*  He's like, oh, like, oh, oh, he doesn't know nothing about it. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7430.0s)]
*  Well, just because it's a Seiko because it's a Seiko instead of like a Rolex or something like that. [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7434.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Seiko makes regular real brainwashing that way. Yeah. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7440.0s)]
*  We're like, once they find out, like those shoes are fucking ugly. Oh, well, these are, you know, these are Gucci. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7444.0s)]
*  And they go, oh, OK. Yeah. Now they like it's like, now you like them. Right. Yeah. That's weird, man. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7450.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. People get brainwashed in the Acura thing is one of them. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7455.0s)]
*  But that old NSX sold real well. The old NSX, the first one that came out, I think that only had 250 horsepower or maybe 270. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7460.0s)]
*  I care about how I feel in the car, really, more than anything. Yeah. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7469.0s)]
*  Once you like to me is like, man, once you pass 300 horsepower, you know, you don't need that's all for you. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7472.0s)]
*  That's all extra. Yeah, it's all. Yeah. [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7481.0s)]
*  About 300 is enough where you can pass most people on the highway. Yeah. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7483.0s)]
*  And that's all you need. Everything after that is just a funsies. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7487.0s)]
*  I mean, if you're just driving around, why do you why are you going that fast? [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7491.0s)]
*  Unless you want to merge on the highway. That's one thing about the Tesla. [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7495.0s)]
*  When you have to merge on the highway, it's like, yeah, well, especially out here because the highway is all fucking weirdly designed. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7498.0s)]
*  Very weird. Where the where the there's like very little space between the on ramp and off ramp. [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7505.0s)]
*  So you've got to get on and merge like immediately. [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7512.0s)]
*  Yeah, probably. I think it's one of the most dangerous highway systems in the country. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7515.0s)]
*  It's goofy. Yeah. It was made for like when top speeds was, you know, 40 miles an hour like horse and buggies or some shit. [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7519.0s)]
*  I don't know. It's not. It's not well designed. No, I think it definitely was not designed for this many people either. [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7526.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think they just never anticipated the kind of growth. Austin's real slow to do what makes sense. [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7534.0s)]
*  You know, yeah, yeah. I remember when I first got here and it was like and I was so pissed because the winter time fucked everything up. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7539.0s)]
*  And I was like, how y'all not ready for the winter? It snows two years in a row and you guys still don't have any snow plows. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7545.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, they were like, oh, it is usually get cold out here. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7551.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know what? America doesn't usually get attacked. But after 9-11, we did something. You know what I mean? Right. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7554.0s)]
*  You can't you can't if you had a 9-11 in 2002 and 2003, you'd be like, set some shit up. Right. [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7561.0s)]
*  They haven't made any changes. Three winters in a row fucked up out here. They haven't changed. [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7567.0s)]
*  And this winter they're saying it's going to be bad again. Oh, it's going to be real bad. How do you know? You know it. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7572.0s)]
*  Because it's so hot. I think like the same way they knew it was going to be a really hot summer. [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7576.0s)]
*  Yeah. Right. Well, obviously climate change. But on top of that, the way the the way the weather was before that, [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7581.0s)]
*  something happened where we had like a heat dome over this area. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7588.0s)]
*  And so we didn't have a really, really wet spring like we normally do. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7593.0s)]
*  And so there was no moisture left to cool it off during the summer. So it was like extra, extra hot. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7598.0s)]
*  Dry hot. Yeah. And so I don't know shit about weather, but I think that's how they can predict that the winter is going to be even worse. [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7604.0s)]
*  Unseasonably cold and stormy winter as El Nino, a climate phenomenon that also often brings wetter, cooler weather to Texas rolls in. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7613.0s)]
*  After a hot, hot summer, Austinites are ready for a cool down. Yeah. Until the fucking roads freeze over and there's no plows. [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7622.0s)]
*  But the problem with that, though, is El Nino is supposed to be a cooler summer, too. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7631.0s)]
*  But we didn't have that because of the heat dome. The heat dome. [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7635.0s)]
*  I think these motherfuckers trying to predict weather, I think they all wrong from now on. [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7639.0s)]
*  We were having a conversation last night and I said this. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7643.0s)]
*  If the government could affect the weather, if they really had technology that could affect the weather, would they? [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7647.0s)]
*  Yeah, they would. And they do. Well, they're not even hiding the cloud seating because they can do that. [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7658.0s)]
*  They can do that in Abu Dhabi, right? Or Saudi Arabia. They make it rain. Abu Dhabi, they make it rain once a week. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7664.0s)]
*  So baller. Yeah, of course they can. Of course they can. That's so baller. It never rains here. Oh, yes it does. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7671.0s)]
*  It rains once a week. Like every week. It rains every Friday at 12 o'clock. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7678.0s)]
*  Yeah, but that's always been around. Cloud seating has been a thing. [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7684.0s)]
*  But you're saying if they could cause earthquakes, if they could make a thunderstorm, if they could. Right. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7688.0s)]
*  I'm sure they would. They definitely would. Yeah. If they could do something along those lines. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7692.0s)]
*  Do you know the wacky conspiracy theory? And this is wacky. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7700.0s)]
*  About the South Pole. The South Pole is some sort of a direct energy weapon. [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7704.0s)]
*  That there's like some station down there that they've pretended is just for receiving, but it's actually for transmitting. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7711.0s)]
*  I have no idea if any of this is nonsense. It's just fun. It's fun when people talk crazy. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7718.0s)]
*  But this guy was on the Sean Ryan show and he is a air quotes whistleblower. [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7724.0s)]
*  And he's explaining how he went down there and he read the operating manual for this device. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7731.0s)]
*  And this device caused the earthquakes in Christchurch, New Zealand. [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7737.0s)]
*  And I was like, what? It's so hard to know if you're just a comic in Austin. [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7741.0s)]
*  How the fuck do I know it's going down in the South Pole? [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7749.0s)]
*  Like I said, whenever somebody's saying some wild shit to me, I start asking them, what other shit do you believe so I can know how believable you are? [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7753.0s)]
*  Because you might be one of those people that just believes bullshit easily. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7761.0s)]
*  Hey, what do you say? Give us some volume. [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7766.0s)]
*  In every single door in the facility, I had complete access to every compartment they manufactured. [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7772.0s)]
*  What are you blowing the whistle on? [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7779.0s)]
*  That there are technologies at the South Pole station that people can't even consider that exist on this planet. [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7780.0s)]
*  Directed energy weapon systems is something that people need to get into their vocabulary fast. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7785.0s)]
*  The IceCube neutrino detector is not simply a passive listening device as presented for the science that they're claiming it to do. [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7789.0s)]
*  It also has the capacity to transmit. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7797.0s)]
*  There are embedded in the ice what are called digital optical modules, DOMs. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7800.0s)]
*  They're about the size of a basketball. [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7805.0s)]
*  The array embedded in the ice is one kilometer by one kilometer by one kilometer. [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7806.0s)]
*  It is the world's largest telescope. [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7811.0s)]
*  And now because we have proven that it can transmit, it's the world's largest directed energy weapon system. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7814.0s)]
*  It is responsible for the earthquakes in Christchurch, New Zealand. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7820.0s)]
*  I physically... [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7824.0s)]
*  Okay, when he says one kilometer by one kilometer by one kilometer, does he mean it's one kilometer high, it's one kilometer long, and one kilometer wide? [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7825.0s)]
*  I think down. [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7834.0s)]
*  A whole kilometer into the ground. [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7835.0s)]
*  Yeah, he could have just said a cube kilometer. [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7836.0s)]
*  Well, it kind of... [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7838.0s)]
*  I mean, it's more impressive, I guess, just to think about it goes a kilometer into the ground. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7839.0s)]
*  He's a former firefighter contractor. [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7844.0s)]
*  Arrathion exposed the company's alleged ability to create earthquakes worldwide, linking to hidden directed energy weapon systems at South Pole Station. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7847.0s)]
*  So what is this? [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7856.0s)]
*  How would being a fire... [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7857.0s)]
*  How would a firefighter contractor have access to that? [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7859.0s)]
*  I don't know how any of this is real. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7862.0s)]
*  I have no idea. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7865.0s)]
*  I don't know what his job was. [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7866.0s)]
*  What's his name? [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7868.0s)]
*  Eric Hecker? [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7869.0s)]
*  Yeah, I was trying to look him up. [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7870.0s)]
*  I don't know, man. [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7871.0s)]
*  He had some nice patches on his jacket, though. [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7872.0s)]
*  It looked official. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7874.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7875.0s)]
*  I mean, you full of shit until I see some proof. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7876.0s)]
*  Because extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7877.0s)]
*  It's like, you saying some wild shit, you got to at least show me something. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7883.0s)]
*  Yes, good point. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7886.0s)]
*  Yeah, because you were a firefighter contractor, I don't feel like you would have the keys to the secret death ray. [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7887.0s)]
*  You know? [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7893.0s)]
*  Well, I think what he was saying was that he was reading the documents of the owner's manual. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7894.0s)]
*  And that's when he realized that it's capable of transmitting. [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7901.0s)]
*  I believe he says that in the show. [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7904.0s)]
*  Yeah, but how would a firefighter have access to manuals and shit? [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7906.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7910.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's crazy. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7911.0s)]
*  And why he's still alive. [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7912.0s)]
*  This is what the thing he's talking about is when I Google it. [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7914.0s)]
*  Antarctic Muon and Neutrino Detector Array is what it's called. [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7918.0s)]
*  And it goes, let me see what it looks like. [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7922.0s)]
*  The neutrino detector is real. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7925.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7927.0s)]
*  But that's the facility on top of it. [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7928.0s)]
*  And whoa, look what happens under the ground. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7930.0s)]
*  Holy shit. [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7933.0s)]
*  But the reason it has to be so deep under the ground is so it's protected from like extra shit. [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7935.0s)]
*  So they know when it gets hit that it was a neutrino. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7946.0s)]
*  Ah, right. [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7949.0s)]
*  So it's real. [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7951.0s)]
*  A lot of the stuff he said was real. [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7952.0s)]
*  But here's the thing we also know, Joe, is that the best place to hide a lie is between two truths. [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7954.0s)]
*  The best bullshit is they say a lot of true shit and they sneak the bullshit in there. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7958.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7963.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, the neutrino detector is this and this and this and this and that. [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7964.0s)]
*  And did you know it can make you gay? [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7966.0s)]
*  Antarctic Muon and Neutrino Detector Array, the shield provided by looking for only upward-going neutrinos that must have passed through Earth. [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7971.0s)]
*  Something no other known particle can do. [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7980.0s)]
*  Oh wow. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7983.0s)]
*  So it's through Earth. [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7984.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7985.0s)]
*  Neutrinos don't interact with matter almost at all. [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7986.0s)]
*  So that neutrino detector is way, way, way, way down and they're waiting to see like sparks of light so they know that was a neutrino. [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7991.0s)]
*  Wow. [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7997.0s)]
*  But if they put it on the surface, I think they can't tell the difference between one that came, because they're pouring out of the sun. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=7998.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8007.0s)]
*  So they're looking for ones that have passed through the Earth that have come from other places. [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8008.0s)]
*  Wow. [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8013.0s)]
*  So they know for sure. [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8014.0s)]
*  So every now and then it's so unlikely that one will interact with matter that like it doesn't happen that often. [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8015.0s)]
*  Isn't it crazy they spent that much money to build that thing, to find that out? [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8022.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8028.0s)]
*  So that's the other thing. [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8029.0s)]
*  The thing this guy is saying, I don't even understand how that would work. [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8030.0s)]
*  How could it be both things? [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8033.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8035.0s)]
*  Yeah, because I think it's just a pool full of some special kind of water, some special kind of liquid. [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8037.0s)]
*  That, you know, it's enough where it makes a neutrino more likely to fucking hit a nucleus or something. [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8044.0s)]
*  But so I don't understand how that's gathering power that it can transmit. [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8053.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8057.0s)]
*  The thing about people like that, and I'm not saying this guy's not telling the truth, [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8060.0s)]
*  but I'm saying when I see stories about like someone talking about like some alien base that's underground [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8064.0s)]
*  and there's just aliens down there and one of them shot at me with a laser beam. [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8071.0s)]
*  If you were hiding some shit, like one of the best ways to make it seem ridiculous that you're hiding some shit [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8076.0s)]
*  is get some guys out of his fucking mind to go tell some wacky ass story. [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8084.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8088.0s)]
*  Fill him full of lies. [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8089.0s)]
*  Tell him, yeah, you know, we started the earthquake in Christchurch, New Zealand. [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8090.0s)]
*  It was started with this thing. [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8094.0s)]
*  And then you tell him, yeah, it's actually a transmitter. [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8096.0s)]
*  And then you have the guy go tell him. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8099.0s)]
*  And now everybody's like, oh, that's kooky. [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8100.0s)]
*  The idea of doing that is kooky. [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8103.0s)]
*  Directed energy weapon is kooky. [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8105.0s)]
*  Well, meanwhile, it wasn't even that. [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8106.0s)]
*  They got a real one somewhere. [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8108.0s)]
*  So now they've discredited the whole idea of directed energy weapons. [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8110.0s)]
*  They got some shit out in the desert in Nevada that's real. [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8113.0s)]
*  The government loves conspiracy. [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8116.0s)]
*  I mean, why wouldn't they? [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8118.0s)]
*  If I was running some top secret program, like a directed energy weapon, [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8119.0s)]
*  I would have someone give them bad information, give them fake stories, and then have them go expose it. [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8125.0s)]
*  Like have someone who's like most likely to blab and then have that person give them this knucklehead story. [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8134.0s)]
*  And then he goes out and says it and then everybody researches it. [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8141.0s)]
*  You just tell Roseanne. [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8146.0s)]
*  Just tell Roseanne of the secret. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8147.0s)]
*  Tell her right before she goes on stage. [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8151.0s)]
*  There's a direct energy weapon. [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8153.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's, you know, it's one of those things, man. [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8156.0s)]
*  It's like I have no fucking idea what they're capable of doing. [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8161.0s)]
*  See that right there. That's the real flag to me. [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8163.0s)]
*  That's the bottle on this website. [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8165.0s)]
*  This is a little red flaggy. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8166.0s)]
*  A self-educated research investigator. [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8168.0s)]
*  Fuck out of there. [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8170.0s)]
*  That's worse than homeschooling. [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8171.0s)]
*  That takes from as many odd life experiences and connects with others. [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8175.0s)]
*  Eric was raised on Long Island. [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8178.0s)]
*  Okay. [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8180.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8181.0s)]
*  Part of the Stargate project run by the CIA and the DIA. [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8183.0s)]
*  And a child. [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8188.0s)]
*  What? [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8189.0s)]
*  His childhood included being part of the Stargate project run by the CIA, DIA. [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8190.0s)]
*  Later on in experiences in the submarine service following that, [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8196.0s)]
*  he became a plumber for some of the wealthiest people in the world back on Long Island. [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8200.0s)]
*  What? [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8204.0s)]
*  That's a weird turn of events. [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8205.0s)]
*  In 2010, Eric took a contract to work at the South Pole station for a year. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8207.0s)]
*  Also, he took it. [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8212.0s)]
*  He went from being an amazing plumber to being a firefighter in the South Pole. [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8213.0s)]
*  That's what he's saying. [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8219.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8220.0s)]
*  Okay. [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8221.0s)]
*  Always the avid researcher. [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8222.0s)]
*  It was not until Eric began working remotely throughout the state of Alaska [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8223.0s)]
*  that he started making connections that his own life may not have been what he thought it was. [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8227.0s)]
*  Now he's trying to help others see that things may not be as we were told. [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8233.0s)]
*  Three exclamation points. [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8238.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8240.0s)]
*  See, this is the thing, man. [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8241.0s)]
*  That feels a little red flaggy, does it? [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8243.0s)]
*  Yeah, that feels real weird. [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8245.0s)]
*  I mean, what the fuck is a product? [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8247.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, you can donate, support on Patreon, and shop his CBD products. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8248.0s)]
*  What is a self-educated researcher? [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8252.0s)]
*  Does he have an NFT? [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8254.0s)]
*  Well, I don't know. [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8255.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8256.0s)]
*  Well, the thing is, it's like, maybe he's telling the truth. [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8257.0s)]
*  Maybe. [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8260.0s)]
*  But it's like, would you trust a self-educated doctor? [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8261.0s)]
*  But if I wanted to obscure the truth, I would tell everything to a wacky dude. [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8264.0s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8269.0s)]
*  See, that's what's going to kill us. [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8270.0s)]
*  It's the death of truth. [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8271.0s)]
*  We can't tell what's true. [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8272.0s)]
*  Look, maybe that guy's honest. [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8274.0s)]
*  Maybe he's telling the absolute truth. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8276.0s)]
*  And maybe it's so crazy that we think that he's a loon because the story sounds impossible. [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8278.0s)]
*  The story sounds impossible that they would hide some sort of a directed energy weapon [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8284.0s)]
*  in some beautiful project to try to detect neutrinos. [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8289.0s)]
*  Right? [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8294.0s)]
*  You would think that that would be a really good way. [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8295.0s)]
*  Yeah, but at the same time, why? [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8298.0s)]
*  Could they do both things? [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8299.0s)]
*  We're too stupid with this. [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8301.0s)]
*  Why would you have to hide anything in the South Pole? [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8302.0s)]
*  I mean, ain't nobody going down there? [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8304.0s)]
*  Nobody's looking, because that's a good place to do it. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8305.0s)]
*  If all you have to do is just be deep into the earth, what better place to do it than the place where absolutely no one's going to visit it? [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8306.0s)]
*  They couldn't even cover up the sexual harassment down there. [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8311.0s)]
*  In the South Pole? [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8314.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8315.0s)]
*  Yeah? [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8317.0s)]
*  I mean, think about that. [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8318.0s)]
*  Because you out in the middle of nowhere. [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8319.0s)]
*  You go out there, you out there. [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8321.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8323.0s)]
*  It ain't like you could just hop home real quick. [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8324.0s)]
*  So it's like, yeah, people fucking, people getting fucked out there. [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8326.0s)]
*  I'm sure. [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8328.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8329.0s)]
*  Have you stuck out there? [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8330.0s)]
*  You also have a real concern of dying. [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8331.0s)]
*  Like, if something breaks down. [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8334.0s)]
*  Yeah, you can't get away. [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8335.0s)]
*  You can't get anywhere. [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8336.0s)]
*  You got to wait for someone to come rescue you. [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8337.0s)]
*  And whoever's in charge of the food, you got to fuck them. [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8339.0s)]
*  Bro, living out there must be weird. [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8342.0s)]
*  It's only scientists. [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8346.0s)]
*  No other humans live in the South Pole. [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8347.0s)]
*  That must be so weird. [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8349.0s)]
*  Just to be in a place where you know you can't survive, stay outside too long. [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8351.0s)]
*  Yeah, like, not even, you can't go outside at all. [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8356.0s)]
*  I think if you're out there, like, if you step out there without protection on, [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8360.0s)]
*  if you just step out there during certain times, I think that's going to, [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8365.0s)]
*  the burns will be, it'll permanently burn you. [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8368.0s)]
*  Really? [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8371.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8372.0s)]
*  Yeah, at the coldest times in the South Pole, you can't just, you have to be suited up to go outside. [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8373.0s)]
*  You can't just... [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8377.0s)]
*  You can't breathe the air? [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8378.0s)]
*  I don't think so. [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8379.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8380.0s)]
*  No. [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8381.0s)]
*  How cold does it get? [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8382.0s)]
*  Well, let's look it up. [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8383.0s)]
*  Yeah, let's look it up. [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8384.0s)]
*  I don't think it's the coldest place on Earth. [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8385.0s)]
*  It's not? [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8387.0s)]
*  It's not? [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8388.0s)]
*  I don't think so. [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8389.0s)]
*  What is? [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8390.0s)]
*  Well, let's look it up. [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8391.0s)]
*  What's the coldest place on Earth? [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8392.0s)]
*  It's probably Siberia. [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8393.0s)]
*  Oh, East Antarctica, Plateau. [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8395.0s)]
*  What is it? [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8397.0s)]
*  It gets negative 98, negative 144 degrees Fahrenheit. [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8398.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8402.0s)]
*  And so it's like, you breathe one of those breaths in, that's going to fuck your whole shit up. [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8403.0s)]
*  But wait a minute. [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8408.0s)]
*  How is that true? [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8410.0s)]
*  Because I've done the cryo chamber. [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8411.0s)]
*  The cryo chamber is minus 250. [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8414.0s)]
*  Yeah, but that water's not touching your skin, right? [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8418.0s)]
*  No, it's not touching you. [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8420.0s)]
*  It's air. [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8421.0s)]
*  It's air. [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8422.0s)]
*  Yeah, I have no idea. [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8423.0s)]
*  How do you do that? [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8424.0s)]
*  But maybe, but you know what? [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8425.0s)]
*  Maybe this because there's no moisture in it. [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8426.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8427.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8428.0s)]
*  I have no idea what the science is. [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8429.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8431.0s)]
*  How is that not freezing the fuck out of your mouth? [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8432.0s)]
*  You do wear a mask, though. [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8434.0s)]
*  So is the... [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8435.0s)]
*  You wear a surgical mask when you go in there. [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8436.0s)]
*  The East Antarctica Plateau is the coldest place on Earth with temperatures as low as [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8438.0s)]
*  negative 144 degrees Fahrenheit. [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8442.0s)]
*  It's located in Antarctica. [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8445.0s)]
*  Humans can't inhale air that cold for more than a few breaths. [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8447.0s)]
*  It would cause our lungs to hemorrhage. [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8451.0s)]
*  Russian scientists ducking out to check on the weather station would wear masks that [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8453.0s)]
*  warm the air before they breathed it in. [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8457.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're going to die. [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8459.0s)]
*  So how are you able to do that in those cryo chambers? [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8461.0s)]
*  Do you wear a mask in the cryo chamber? [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8464.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8466.0s)]
*  There you go. [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8467.0s)]
*  But you don't have to. [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8468.0s)]
*  Oh. [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8469.0s)]
*  Maybe it's that limited amount of time. [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8470.0s)]
*  Well, I don't know. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8471.0s)]
*  No, let me look at that. [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8472.0s)]
*  Maybe you do have to. [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8473.0s)]
*  Maybe I'm wrong. [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8474.0s)]
*  How come you don't freeze to death in the cryo chamber? [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8475.0s)]
*  There's two different kinds, too. [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8478.0s)]
*  There's ones that go below the neck, and they're filled with, like, gas. [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8481.0s)]
*  It's like it looks cloudy. [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8486.0s)]
*  And then there's a kind where they just cool the air, and you walk in, and there's, like, [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8488.0s)]
*  a thermometer. [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8493.0s)]
*  It's brutally cold. [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8494.0s)]
*  But it's way more doable than the ice bath. [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8497.0s)]
*  Cold plunges are way harder to do. [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8504.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's too... [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8507.0s)]
*  I don't understand this. [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8509.0s)]
*  I don't understand the answer that you gave me. [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8510.0s)]
*  What does the answer say? [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8513.0s)]
*  Because you're doing it with the mask on. [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8514.0s)]
*  I was trying to say that, like, the speed, it just happened really fast. [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8516.0s)]
*  But how would that little mask protect you from hemorrhaging? [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8521.0s)]
*  Does that really work? [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8526.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8527.0s)]
*  Just breathing cold air with that little bitch-ass mask is going to protect you? [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8531.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think so. [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8535.0s)]
*  Because you say it's optional, right? [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8536.0s)]
*  I think so. [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8538.0s)]
*  I think some people didn't wear the mask. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8539.0s)]
*  I might be wrong, though. [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8541.0s)]
*  I might be wrong. [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8543.0s)]
*  I know I always wore gloves, and you always wore, like, heavy socks. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8544.0s)]
*  Even for the Antarctica thing, it says you can use a snorkel or breathe through your jacket. [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8549.0s)]
*  That's enough to warm the air. [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8553.0s)]
*  So it just has to be warmed a little bit, and that's enough to warm it, enough probably. [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8555.0s)]
*  Okay. [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8559.0s)]
*  Yeah, because I think you can't afford for the moisture in your lungs to freeze. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8561.0s)]
*  You know? [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8568.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8570.0s)]
*  Or boil. [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8571.0s)]
*  Or boil. [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8572.0s)]
*  Like, that's how you die in space. [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8573.0s)]
*  When the pressure is so low that the boiling point drops low, so all the moisture in your body would just boil. [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8574.0s)]
*  Really? [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8580.0s)]
*  Yeah, like, if your helmet came off in space, you would die from...that's how you would die. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8581.0s)]
*  You would... [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8585.0s)]
*  You boil. [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8586.0s)]
*  You boil and, like, blow it up. [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8587.0s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8589.0s)]
*  Because in movies, you always freeze. [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8590.0s)]
*  They're always like... [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8592.0s)]
*  And you see their face turn to blue. [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8593.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, see, I think... [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8595.0s)]
*  Well, listen, I think there's debate about... [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8597.0s)]
*  I think if you ask any...if you ask the astrophysicists how you would die in space, they would all give you a slightly different answer. [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8599.0s)]
*  But that's the one I'm going with. [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8605.0s)]
*  That sounds reasonable. [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8607.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8609.0s)]
*  The first thing that would happen to you is that...I mean, your body might freeze up after that, but the first thing that would happen is that the liquids in your eyeballs, your mouth, your lungs, all that would boil off. [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8610.0s)]
*  Jesus. [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8620.0s)]
*  I know that's a fact. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8621.0s)]
*  So I don't know what happens to the rest of you. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8623.0s)]
*  That's what's super bizarre about even the concept of aliens. [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8625.0s)]
*  Because our body is designed to survive our atmosphere, our gravity, you know, our temperature. [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8629.0s)]
*  Like, we're designed for a very narrow window. [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8638.0s)]
*  Our very specific mixture of air, like oxygen and nitrogen. [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8641.0s)]
*  Yeah, 15 seconds. [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8645.0s)]
*  You have 15 seconds in a cosmic vacuum. [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8647.0s)]
*  Oxygen deprivation. [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8651.0s)]
*  Assuming you don't hold your breath during decompression, it will take about 15 seconds for your O2-deprived blood to get to your brain. [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8653.0s)]
*  When this happens, you'll pass out and then you'll die. [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8661.0s)]
*  That's oxygen deprivation. [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8664.0s)]
*  Assuming that you don't hold your breath. [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8666.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8669.0s)]
*  Cosmic vacuum. [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8671.0s)]
*  But click on that. Let's see what the other five ways are. [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8673.0s)]
*  Six ways. [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8676.0s)]
*  Six ways you can die? What does it say? [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8678.0s)]
*  So associations number five. [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8680.0s)]
*  Coming up in the atmosphere. [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8682.0s)]
*  Well, that's obvious. [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8684.0s)]
*  High energy photons, cosmic rays. [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8686.0s)]
*  Fortunately heat doesn't transfer. [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8691.0s)]
*  Ebulism. [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8695.0s)]
*  The motion in your body will start to evaporate. [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8697.0s)]
*  There it is. [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8699.0s)]
*  This is known as ebulism. [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8700.0s)]
*  It happens because of reduction. [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8702.0s)]
*  The pressure causes the boiling point of your bodily fluids to decrease. [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8703.0s)]
*  Brian Simpson dropping knowledge with no notes. [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8708.0s)]
*  With no notes. He just pulled that out. [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8711.0s)]
*  Explosive decompression. [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8713.0s)]
*  Oh boy. [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8714.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8716.0s)]
*  Oh boy. [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8717.0s)]
*  That's what happened. [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8718.0s)]
*  Oh my god. [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8720.0s)]
*  I'm not saying pressurized, but that's going to kill everybody. [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8721.0s)]
*  As long as you don't try to hold your breath during this explosive decompression, [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8724.0s)]
*  you'll survive about 30 seconds before you sustain any permanent injuries. [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8728.0s)]
*  What if you don't hold your breath? [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8732.0s)]
*  How likely is it that you would survive? [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8734.0s)]
*  Bro, that's why the idea of the type of people that you've got to pick to be astronauts. [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8736.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8741.0s)]
*  Look at this. [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8742.0s)]
*  If you hold your breath during decompression, the gas in your lungs will expand due to the lack of ambient pressure. [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8743.0s)]
*  This expansion will eventually cause internal ruptures in your pulmonary tissue. [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8749.0s)]
*  Essentially, your lungs will kind of explode for lack of a better description. [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8753.0s)]
*  As your lungs collapse, the gas they contain will be transformed into massive internal air bubbles. [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8758.0s)]
*  These bubbles will meander through your body. [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8764.0s)]
*  Sooner or later, they will find their way to your vital organs such as your heart and your brain. [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8766.0s)]
*  Which may not actually... [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8771.0s)]
*  Oh my god. [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8773.0s)]
*  Oh, you f**ks. [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8774.0s)]
*  But all of these are like, you got what? 10 to 30 seconds? [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8776.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're dead. [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8779.0s)]
*  You're dead or you're dead. [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8780.0s)]
*  So imagine being an astronaut, like signing up to go somewhere where one mistake could kill you. [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8781.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8787.0s)]
*  And then imagine being in somebody else's mistake could kill you, right? [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8788.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8791.0s)]
*  So now imagine being one of those astronauts that was out there when that one bitch, [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8792.0s)]
*  when she let the wrench float away. [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8796.0s)]
*  I think she was out there to maybe repair the hub bowl or something like that, [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8800.0s)]
*  and she just lost a whole bag or two. [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8803.0s)]
*  You don't remember this? [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8806.0s)]
*  I don't remember. [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8807.0s)]
*  You don't talk about Jamie, don't you? [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8808.0s)]
*  She lost it in space? [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8809.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8810.0s)]
*  And it's like... [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8811.0s)]
*  Oh, right here. [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8814.0s)]
*  Lockpipes, let's not transfer to the next place. [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8815.0s)]
*  Hey, Heidi, crew lockpipes. [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8819.0s)]
*  Yeah? [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8821.0s)]
*  There it goes. [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8822.0s)]
*  We see it? [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8823.0s)]
*  Yeah, we see it. [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8825.0s)]
*  Is there anything they can do now? [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8827.0s)]
*  F**k no. [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8829.0s)]
*  That's it? [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8830.0s)]
*  That's it? [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8831.0s)]
*  Wow. [[02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8836.0s)]
*  So that's the tool bag? [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8837.0s)]
*  And something just fell out of the tool bag? [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8839.0s)]
*  Oh, Jesus, she can't grab it. [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8841.0s)]
*  Oh my God, imagine just even thinking if you grab it, what if you fall? [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8843.0s)]
*  Oh, no, yeah, that's not worth it. [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8847.0s)]
*  You gotta let that shit go. [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8849.0s)]
*  Bro, f**k. [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8850.0s)]
*  Everything about what this poor lady's doing. [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8851.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8857.0s)]
*  That gives me so much anxiety. [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8858.0s)]
*  I just saw your video. [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8861.0s)]
*  Let's say that person was with that tool bag, how they'd get back because they don't have propulsion. [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8863.0s)]
*  You can't swim back because there's nothing to move against. [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8868.0s)]
*  Your only shot is to then use as much force as you can to throw that tool bag backwards and use that as propulsion forward. [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8871.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8878.0s)]
*  You have to throw something the other way. [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8880.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8882.0s)]
*  Or imagine that's the key thing for that whole mission, the whole reason we out here. [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8883.0s)]
*  And you just let that bitch float away. [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8889.0s)]
*  Imagine that the idea of keeping it in a bag. [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8892.0s)]
*  It's not tied to anything. [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8896.0s)]
*  It's not clipped on. [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8899.0s)]
*  But you know what, I'm sure NASA physicists could explain to you why they can't do that. [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8900.0s)]
*  Probably. [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8903.0s)]
*  It's probably a reason why they can't do that. [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8904.0s)]
*  Right, or questions. [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8906.0s)]
*  Or like no magnets or nothing. [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8907.0s)]
*  Nothing? Not like a little f**king bungee cord? [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8909.0s)]
*  Because it looked like that bag, when she opened it, everything was just floating. [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8911.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8914.0s)]
*  It was like, damn, that don't seem like an efficient... [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8915.0s)]
*  No, especially when you get those weird tips to your fingers, you're probably not good at grabbing shit. [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8917.0s)]
*  But they probably have backups. [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8921.0s)]
*  Just floats away. [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8925.0s)]
*  Yeah, but it looked like she... how did you... why did she do that? [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8928.0s)]
*  Well, I think she touched it to like set it down or something like that. [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8930.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8935.0s)]
*  Don't... it gave me anxiety. [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8936.0s)]
*  Just seeing that lady on that machine all the way up there in space. [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8937.0s)]
*  And your reflexes will be like, no! [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8941.0s)]
*  It's so spooky. [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8944.0s)]
*  But she's not the first one that's lost something, right? [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8945.0s)]
*  Oh, I'm sure. [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8948.0s)]
*  I'm sure guys have lost shit. [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8949.0s)]
*  Have they lost people though? [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8951.0s)]
*  Have we ever lost a person? [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8953.0s)]
*  From like floating off? [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8954.0s)]
*  Oh, that's a good question. [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8956.0s)]
*  Because that's one of those things where it's like, as soon as you let go, you dead. [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8958.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8963.0s)]
*  Like you ain't get... it ain't like the movies. [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8964.0s)]
*  It's like as soon as you let go, you gone. [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8965.0s)]
*  Because there's no way, like he said, there's no way for you to... I mean maybe some real... [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8968.0s)]
*  Some Iron Man shit. [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8972.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think you... [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8973.0s)]
*  But you would... [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8974.0s)]
*  For you to do that, you would have to lose air. [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8975.0s)]
*  You would have to risk losing air to propel yourself. [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8977.0s)]
*  What? [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8981.0s)]
*  There were three Russian Cosmos that were lost in space. [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8982.0s)]
*  The first guy almost. [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8985.0s)]
*  What was his name? [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8986.0s)]
*  Yuri Geller? [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8987.0s)]
*  He almost got lost in space? [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8989.0s)]
*  They just got... they drifted away? [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8991.0s)]
*  No, he... the first man in space was a Russian guy. [[02:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8994.0s)]
*  I think his name was... it was Yuri something. [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8997.0s)]
*  And he had a rip in his suit or something like that. [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=8999.0s)]
*  Oh, it depressurized on its way back. [[02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9004.0s)]
*  Okay, yeah. [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9006.0s)]
*  But he survived. [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9007.0s)]
*  I don't think he was ever the same after that, but he survived. [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9009.0s)]
*  And they first sent the dog up, that dog died. [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9013.0s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. I forget the dog's name. [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9018.0s)]
*  Yuri Gagarian was the first guy. [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9019.0s)]
*  Yo, Yuri Gagarian. Who did I say? Yuri Geller? [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9021.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's the... [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9024.0s)]
*  Yeah, Yuri Geller is the magician. [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9025.0s)]
*  Okay, yeah. [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9026.0s)]
*  Yuri Gagarian. [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9027.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's a bad motherfucker, but he definitely didn't come back to save. [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9030.0s)]
*  One orbit of Earth, April 12th, 1961. [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9034.0s)]
*  Damn, back then. [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9037.0s)]
*  You know, gangster, you had to be back then to get one of those fucking rockets. [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9041.0s)]
*  Oh, man, a Russian made one? [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9044.0s)]
*  When did we do it? The... the Brahmas dropped in 19... what was it, three? [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9045.0s)]
*  Or, sorry, the first plane was 1903, bomb was like 40 years later. [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9049.0s)]
*  And then less than 20 to get to space. [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9053.0s)]
*  Yeah. Hey, um, what... I know the United States got a lot of scientists from Operation Paperclip, from Nazi Germany, but how many did Russia get? [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9055.0s)]
*  A lot, the rest of them. [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9066.0s)]
*  Did they... so was there a Russian rocket program like this one with Yuri Gagarian? [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9068.0s)]
*  Operation... I think so. [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9073.0s)]
*  Yeah, we... that's the dirty secret about space travel. [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9077.0s)]
*  Did you see the Indiana Jones movie, by any chance? [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9080.0s)]
*  No, I haven't seen it. [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9082.0s)]
*  There's a little bit of that Operation Paperclip in there, the main, like, bad Nazi guy was, like, helped in the story, he, like, helped... [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9083.0s)]
*  Wait, you haven't seen any Indiana Jones movies? [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9089.0s)]
*  No, I have. I just saw the newer one. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9091.0s)]
*  The newer one. The new one. [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9093.0s)]
*  Oh, there's a new one? [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9094.0s)]
*  Yeah, Dial of Destiny is what it was called. [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9095.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was like out of, like, a month ago. [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9096.0s)]
*  Is it out? Man. [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9097.0s)]
*  Yeah, I just watched it on digital. [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9098.0s)]
*  Uh, do the Nazis have dueling scars? [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9100.0s)]
*  Not in... well, did they? I don't think so. [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9103.0s)]
*  No, it's competing with so many good movies. This might be the best... this might be the best movie year ever. [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9105.0s)]
*  Really? [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9110.0s)]
*  Yeah, and it's crazy that happened during the strike, but it's like... [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9111.0s)]
*  Operation Oso Aivakim. [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9114.0s)]
*  They re-released Oldboy. Have you ever seen Oldboy, Joe? The original? The Korean one? [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9116.0s)]
*  Yes, I have. [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9121.0s)]
*  They just re-released it in theaters. [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9123.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. Um, so this guy was a Soviet... it was a Soviet operation, uh, which more than 2,500 former Nazi German specialists from companies and institutions [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9125.0s)]
*  relevant to military and economic policy in the Soviet Union. [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9135.0s)]
*  They came over just like they came over to America. That's the dirty secret about rocket travel. [[02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9142.0s)]
*  Like, the Nazis had amazing engineers and scientists, and these guys were ahead in rocketry, and we scooped all their evil motherfuckers up. [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9147.0s)]
*  I wonder, why do you think that is? Why do certain cultures have better engineering and all that? [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9158.0s)]
*  That's a very good question. It's like, who gets the jump start on steel, right? You gotta think that if you're in Germany, you know, unlike the United States, it's not an emerging country. [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9164.0s)]
*  It's been around for a long time, you know. They have a long history of automobiles. [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9174.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, think about, like, Mercedes-Benz. What year was that developed? Audi? [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9182.0s)]
*  Well, I think it's whatever your culture takes pride in. [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9188.0s)]
*  Hmm, if they take pride in engineering. [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9191.0s)]
*  Yeah. It's the way, like, when you were in Japan, how the trains never late. Like, never. [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9194.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9200.0s)]
*  Yeah. The one time I remember, the one time it was late, like, the guy had to go on TV and apologize. [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9201.0s)]
*  Yeah, you, like, Japanese corporations, like, the way they run them, man, like, these people are very emotionally attached to the success and failure of their company. [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9205.0s)]
*  And they will work very, very hard to make sure that they don't dishonor their company. [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9216.0s)]
*  They'll work you to death. [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9221.0s)]
*  Yeah. Literally. Yeah. And the products they make are all awesome. [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9222.0s)]
*  But you know what? Over there, the CEO, like, the CEO, the ratio of CEO pay to worker pay is like 20 times less than here. [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9227.0s)]
*  Really? [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9238.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Over here, our country is the- [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9239.0s)]
*  So the workers get paid more. [[02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9241.0s)]
*  The workers get a bigger percentage of what the company makes. [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9243.0s)]
*  That's fair. [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9246.0s)]
*  Yeah, that seems fair to me. [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9247.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9248.0s)]
*  The CEO, there's no CEOs over there that are, like, I forget what the ratio is over here, but it's ridiculous. Ours is the biggest, for sure. [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9249.0s)]
*  The biggest gap between the workers and the CEO. [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9257.0s)]
*  Well, the wildest thing that we do is we have stuff that we can buy cheaper if we build it in places where they don't have any rules. [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9259.0s)]
*  So we go to these places that don't have any rules, and we build all this shit and then sell it in America. [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9270.0s)]
*  That is a really wild loophole. [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9277.0s)]
*  Here's the God-honest truth. Like, you know how when you go to other countries, how they have, like, you buy a pack of cigarettes, it'll have, like, somebody with lung cancer or something on the front? [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9281.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9290.0s)]
*  It's like, if they started, if they had to tell you before you bought something, like, all the horrific shit it was connected to, you'd still buy it. [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9291.0s)]
*  Yep. [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9300.0s)]
*  You know? [[02:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9301.0s)]
*  They were like, hey, this new iPhone? Yeah, well, two kids died in the factory that made this. [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9302.0s)]
*  And you're like, hmm, I need that camera. You know? [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9306.0s)]
*  Well, now for sure, because people are addicted. And also, there's not an ethical choice. [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9311.0s)]
*  They will have to show you a picture of them for you to feel something. [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9315.0s)]
*  If there was an ethical choice, like if you knew Samsung was making their phones in some factory in the United States where all the chips were made here and everybody was on union wages, [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9317.0s)]
*  they all got health care and benefits, they all lived a nice middle-class life, and the phone was more money. [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9330.0s)]
*  The phone would be like $2,500. [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9337.0s)]
*  Well, actually, a lot of people. [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9339.0s)]
*  They're almost that. [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9341.0s)]
*  We've had this conversation too many times, but I think a lot of people would buy it. [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9342.0s)]
*  I think if iPhone just had a made in America phone, like, as an option, and, you know, it became like a status symbol to have the USA phone. [[02:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9345.0s)]
*  You know what? I agree. I think a lot of people would buy it, but I think you would be surprised at who didn't. [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9354.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9360.0s)]
*  Like most of the people making the most noise about this sort of thing would still be like, well, I can't. [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9361.0s)]
*  What am I going to do? [[02:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9367.0s)]
*  Yeah, I got to buy the cheap one. [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9368.0s)]
*  I have to. I can't afford it. [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9369.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, most of the same people that are mad at you for what you buy, they would still buy it. Yeah. [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9371.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9376.0s)]
*  Yeah, because that's what it boils down to. It's like you need money to live. [[02:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9377.0s)]
*  But it is one of the weird things about this country is that everyone is addicted to their phone. [[02:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9379.0s)]
*  Everyone's phone is made by slaves. [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9386.0s)]
*  It's made by at the very bottom of the supply chain. [[02:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9388.0s)]
*  They're they're taking minerals out of the ground in the Congo in abject poverty. [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9393.0s)]
*  The cobalt. [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9400.0s)]
*  Horrific poverty. Yeah. [[02:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9401.0s)]
*  Every phone has cobalt and that shit is like mining. That shit is treacherous. [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9402.0s)]
*  Treacherous. [[02:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9407.0s)]
*  Ain't no CEOs out there at the Cobalt mine. [[02:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9408.0s)]
*  That Siddharth Khoura guy, the journalist that exposed that and came on the podcast and showed us videos about that, like that guy. [[02:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9410.0s)]
*  I mean, he risked his literal life to go there and get footage of that and tell that story. [[02:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9418.0s)]
*  And I don't think it put a dent in the sales. [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9426.0s)]
*  Poor son of a bitch. Yeah, that ain't going to change shit. [[02:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9428.0s)]
*  Look, money talk bullshit walk. That's saying that's the cliche for a reason. [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9430.0s)]
*  It's like, yeah, until you can affect money, no one gives a fuck about the story you're telling. [[02:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9435.0s)]
*  It's true. Yeah. [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9440.0s)]
*  If you don't stop, if you don't stop the money from moving, you just tell you this out there screaming. [[02:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9441.0s)]
*  Remember, I can buy Wall Street. Yes. [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9446.0s)]
*  When they thought those kids was about to run up in Wall Street, they were scared to death. [[02:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9448.0s)]
*  When they knew they were just going to camp outside, they were like, oh yeah, we'll go in the back way. [[02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9453.0s)]
*  You know, it's like if you just make a noise that that shit don't work no more. Yeah. [[02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9459.0s)]
*  Yeah. No, I think if something like that happened today, they'd be terrified. [[02:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9462.0s)]
*  Talk about Wall Street. Yeah, because people seem a little bit more prone to violence. [[02:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9466.0s)]
*  Well, people, yeah, people more dangerous today. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9470.0s)]
*  And you wouldn't be able to. I mean, the thing is, if the cops got on board, like if you couldn't, if you couldn't get count on the police to protect you. [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9473.0s)]
*  Right. That would be a whole other thing. It's a whole other thing. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9480.0s)]
*  Yeah. But damn, are we really ready for the world to change in that way, though? I don't know. I don't know. [[02:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9484.0s)]
*  There would have to be something that's egregious where people could all agree that like this one institution is ruining our country and ruining our lives. [[02:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9490.0s)]
*  There's somehow or another getting away with it. And people decide to go to that place. [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9500.0s)]
*  Well, I just think it's easy. It's easy to get behind a sentiment when it don't cost you nothing. [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9504.0s)]
*  Also, you have to consider that if you are planning something like this, you're going to get infiltrated by the federal government. [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9509.0s)]
*  Oh, you're going to get it. It's going to be agent provocateurs. [[02:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9517.0s)]
*  That standard play. But there's there's no fucking way they're going to let you go storm some institution somewhere, some banking institution or some later. [[02:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9522.0s)]
*  And just fucking shut everything down. There's no way they're going to let you do that. [[02:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9533.0s)]
*  So they're going to probably just join your group. They're going to find out everything about you and they're going to catch a couple of people and turn them turn them into informants. [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9541.0s)]
*  And so they're going to give you immunity. But you have to testify against these people. And then it's over. [[02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9548.0s)]
*  I don't know kind of where we live in it, man. I know too much stuff. Yeah. [[02:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9554.0s)]
*  Well, I could have gone the rest of my life without knowing that Steve is a guy made a reggae song. [[02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9559.0s)]
*  I mean, yeah, I want to have to hear it. Now. [[02:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9565.0s)]
*  I was like stuck in me. Yeah. You're inundated with stuff, too much information. [[02:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9567.0s)]
*  And it's like every day there's a new tragedy every day. Excuse me. [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9575.0s)]
*  There's a new natural disaster. There's something going on in the South Pole directed energy weapons. [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9580.0s)]
*  You know, the best thing that I've done for myself recently is I started scheduling a do not disturb for Mondays. [[02:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9586.0s)]
*  Scheduling. Yeah. Yeah. So on Monday at midnight, I don't get no phone calls. I don't get no notifications. [[02:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9594.0s)]
*  You scheduled on your phone. So it does. It switches to do not disturb. [[02:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9602.0s)]
*  Switches to do not disturb on Monday morning. And it's like that all day. [[02:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9605.0s)]
*  So, I mean, obviously, if you call me twice, it'll come through, like, you know, whatever. [[02:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9610.0s)]
*  But other than that, I'm not I don't see the shit unless I want to. That's good. Yeah. [[02:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9614.0s)]
*  And it's like I got because I can't deal with that. I can't deal with all I'm just overly stimulated. [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9618.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know, you're overly stimulated and people are always sending me links to tweets and links to videos and link to watch this documentary. [[02:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9623.0s)]
*  I'm like, how? Yeah. I don't have any time. It's like you're constantly getting. [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9631.0s)]
*  But the good thing is you're finding out about a lot of stuff like I think way more aware of what just what's going on in the world now. [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9637.0s)]
*  Like human beings in general, but people that are paying attention in particular are way more aware of what's going on in the world than they ever were when I was like 20. [[02:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9645.0s)]
*  Yeah. Like when I was 20, the kids 20 years old today, they know way more about how fucking weird the world. [[02:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9656.0s)]
*  Some would say too much. But that, you know, I bet some before the fucking Internet and before television and before the newspapers would also say that's too much. [[02:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9662.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know, you know, it is, man. It's nothing worse than a young cynic. [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9672.0s)]
*  You know, it's like you 17 and you already cynical like you suppose live ignorant with, you know, pie pie in the sky. [[02:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9676.0s)]
*  Right. Yeah. Party. Have a good time. Yeah. [[02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9685.0s)]
*  Yeah. Have to have some damn positivity, some hope. Yes. Positivity and hope. [[02:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9688.0s)]
*  Was that a bug? I didn't see a bug. We're talking about. There's never been a bug in there. No, not seen bugs. [[02:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9695.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, you don't want young cynics, but I'm not even saying it that way. [[02:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9703.0s)]
*  I'm just saying they're more aware of how bizarre everything is. Something's not going to turn out well. [[02:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9707.0s)]
*  But there's a very real possibility that it might not turn out well. [[02:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9713.0s)]
*  Oh, no, Joe, we're doomed. I'm full on like really. Yeah. [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9716.0s)]
*  Because because the solution to all the major problems that face humanity require a bit of selfless cooperation that I just don't think humans are capable of. [[02:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9721.0s)]
*  Really? On a grand scale. No, no, no. It's so easy to divide humans. [[02:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9735.0s)]
*  You know, because because we have so many differences. [[02:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9740.0s)]
*  There's way more differences than we have perceived connection. Right. [[02:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9744.0s)]
*  So it's like even if you get people to unite for a little bit, it's only a matter of time for they fall apart. [[02:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9748.0s)]
*  Well, people also love to collect in groups and then go after other groups. Right. [[02:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9753.0s)]
*  You know, they love to do that. It makes them a part of something bigger than themselves. [[02:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9759.0s)]
*  That's why people love to call themselves activists when they're really just bitching about shit online, because you join a group of people that are also like into the same thing. [[02:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9763.0s)]
*  And then you have like camaraderie within the group. [[02:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9772.0s)]
*  You support each other's like posts and tweets. You know what I'm saying? [[02:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9775.0s)]
*  So you're it's that it becomes very community oriented. [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9779.0s)]
*  It is why the call yourself an activist when you're not leaving the house. [[02:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9782.0s)]
*  You're not active at all. They're an online activist. [[02:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9785.0s)]
*  Yeah, they call they call us slack divas. [[02:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9788.0s)]
*  But I get why some people, even if what your cause is, is fucking stupid. [[02:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9791.0s)]
*  I get why you'd be drawn to being a part of a group because a lot of people are alone. [[02:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9797.0s)]
*  They got nothing. And if you become a part of a group, whatever that group is, especially if it's support, it's a noble cause. [[02:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9802.0s)]
*  Now you're you've got a purpose. Now you're fighting for something. Right. [[02:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9808.0s)]
*  I'm out here fighting for something. I'm fighting for a better country. [[02:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9813.0s)]
*  You're not doing shit. You know, and then you get self righteous with it. [[02:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9817.0s)]
*  Yeah. Go excuse me for caring about the world. [[02:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9820.0s)]
*  It's also it's like it's hard to have an objective opinion about so many different things because so many different things that we talk about. [[02:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9824.0s)]
*  There's like your side already agrees that this is the solution or your side already agrees that we must support Ukraine or your side already agrees that climate change is real. [[02:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9833.0s)]
*  It becomes it becomes dogmatic. Yeah. But. [[02:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9845.0s)]
*  But we're so vulnerable to that. It's amazing. It's amazing how vulnerable we are to that. [[02:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9849.0s)]
*  Well, what it really what it really is is that it distorts your. [[02:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9855.0s)]
*  Because because we forget like the truth is not just the conclusion, but it's also like the like we talked earlier. [[02:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9862.0s)]
*  How do you decide what's true? That's just as important as whatever you say and the truth is. [[02:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9867.0s)]
*  Yeah. And when you get in groups and get into the dogma, it's like that it takes complete takes it away. [[02:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9872.0s)]
*  There's just the truth. Yeah. And we don't get to scrutinize how we got there or or any of that. [[02:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9877.0s)]
*  It's just you believe this or you not right. You're not a true believer. You're not part of the group. [[02:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9883.0s)]
*  So it takes away people's ability to be discerning. [[02:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9887.0s)]
*  Yeah, it does. And there's also a fear of stepping out of the lines because if you're living like a lot of this is interaction you're having on social media, [[02:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9891.0s)]
*  which in which people are much more likely to attack you, much more likely to insult you than they would be to your face if you were saying the same thing. [[02:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9901.0s)]
*  So it's like then you feel that like, oh, I'm being attacked. [[02:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9908.0s)]
*  And then you get caught up in this weird web of like checking all your mentions and seeing who's mad at you for what you said. [[02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9914.0s)]
*  And I stopped giving a fuck. I really did. I realize I don't have the I don't have time for that. [[02:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9921.0s)]
*  I'm not going to argue with you for free. You know, yeah, I don't have time for that. [[02:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9927.0s)]
*  It's interesting to see people lose their whole life to it, though. Yeah. [[02:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9932.0s)]
*  Some people get they get too obsessed with it. Like I told you, I don't I don't watch the news. [[02:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9935.0s)]
*  I only I only absorb the news that rises to my attention. [[02:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9941.0s)]
*  So while I'm looking up like this, if some come up here and I look at it, Ari was just saying the exact same thing. Yeah. [[02:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9945.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm with him on that. I mean, he went extreme. Like, you know, he has no what's going on. [[02:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9951.0s)]
*  Right. But but it's it's I feel like it makes my opinions pure that I that I'm not being in because because it's hard to get the news [[02:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9956.0s)]
*  without being told how to feel about it simultaneously. Right. [[02:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9965.0s)]
*  Like, here's the news and here's also the correct feeling from your group. Right. Right. [[02:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9968.0s)]
*  And it's like it makes you be fake. You know, and so I'd rather hear about the news. [[02:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9974.0s)]
*  I only really hear about the news when I'm doing my podcast. [[02:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9979.0s)]
*  Yes, we're brand Simpson available every Thursday on our platform. [[02:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9982.0s)]
*  I I I rather I wait till my producer tells me some shit. [[02:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9985.0s)]
*  And that's when I know the news. I very rarely am I like looking because I hate that. [[02:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9990.0s)]
*  You know, like, you know, people that are like obsessed with Trump and obsessed with Biden. [[02:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=9995.0s)]
*  And every time you see him, depending on what's how they do and they got they got new facts for you. [[02:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10000.0s)]
*  And like, yeah, like, damn, man, like, what's the point of that? What is the point? [[02:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10004.0s)]
*  You don't get anything out of knowing all this. [[02:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10008.0s)]
*  You know, you've already decided who you're going to vote for. [[02:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10010.0s)]
*  And that's all the power you have because they're caught up in a game. [[02:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10013.0s)]
*  It's like rooting for the Dolphins. You're caught up in this fucking thing. [[02:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10016.0s)]
*  Like, you know, we're playing Pittsburgh. Fuck Pittsburgh. Right. [[02:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10019.0s)]
*  You know, it's just people just get wrapped up in this idea that if somehow or another [[02:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10023.0s)]
*  Biden stays in office, everything's going to be great. [[02:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10028.0s)]
*  If Trump gets in office, the world's going to end. Yeah. Or vice versa. [[02:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10030.0s)]
*  Or vice versa. Or vice versa. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10034.0s)]
*  It's like, bro, you know, so funny is almost nothing will change no matter who it is. [[02:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10037.0s)]
*  Some things will change. Like that's where I'm at. [[02:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10042.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, surface level things will change, but like the main agenda, the real powers that be, [[02:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10045.0s)]
*  they ain't letting me. You know, they let little stuff change. [[02:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10050.0s)]
*  So you feel like you're you have power. Right. [[02:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10053.0s)]
*  But the main agenda, that shit ain't shifting. [[02:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10057.0s)]
*  But what's interesting is if if if we're going to find out how much power [[02:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10060.0s)]
*  they really have to decide who becomes president, because if Trump wins, like, what do they do? [[02:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10067.0s)]
*  What do they do then? Let him be president from prison. [[02:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10075.0s)]
*  I don't know. Do you think he has a real shot at going to prison? [[02:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10083.0s)]
*  No, no. Listen, I think it's I think it's I think it's cute. [[02:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10087.0s)]
*  It's cute. But look, man, again, money talk bullshit walk. [[02:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10092.0s)]
*  When when has a billionaire ever gone to prison for any reason [[02:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10097.0s)]
*  other than fucking with other rich people's money? [[02:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10107.0s)]
*  That's the only time you see people that rich go to prison. [[02:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10110.0s)]
*  There's no other time. There's no. [[02:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10114.0s)]
*  So it's like this hope that this can be that he's going to be the first one. [[02:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10116.0s)]
*  I highly doubt it. I could be wrong. [[02:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10119.0s)]
*  But but generally, people, people that are his rich, they don't go to prison. [[02:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10121.0s)]
*  We were just talking about that the other day. [[02:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10126.0s)]
*  They didn't even put the Sackler family in jail. Right. [[02:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10128.0s)]
*  When do you because they was fucking with poor people. [[02:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10131.0s)]
*  They put Bernie Madoff in jail. [[02:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10134.0s)]
*  They put Elizabeth Holmes in jail. [[02:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10136.0s)]
*  They put the Enron dudes. [[02:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10140.0s)]
*  They put them down because they was fucking with other rich people. [[02:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10142.0s)]
*  But as long as you stick to fucking with poor people or trying to cheat, [[02:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10146.0s)]
*  whatever, you can't go to prison. You're not. [[02:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10149.0s)]
*  You're just I don't think so. [[02:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10151.0s)]
*  If Trump actually goes to prison, that will mark some kind of progress, I suppose. [[02:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10154.0s)]
*  You know, but at the end of the day, they all look out for each other. [[02:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10159.0s)]
*  But not really, because if that's the if you could target your political enemies [[02:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10162.0s)]
*  and have them locked up to prevent them from being able to run against you, [[02:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10167.0s)]
*  that's some banana Republic shit. [[02:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10170.0s)]
*  But that's where it gets dangerous because they could use it on the other people. [[02:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10172.0s)]
*  Exactly. That the smart people know that the real smart people know that [[02:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10175.0s)]
*  what you're actually doing is setting a precedent. [[02:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10181.0s)]
*  Yes. And you don't. [[02:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10184.0s)]
*  And it's real fine when when it's happening to the person you want it to happen to. [[02:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10186.0s)]
*  Exactly. What happens when the other side has that power? [[02:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10190.0s)]
*  Exactly. It's going to be a problem. [[02:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10193.0s)]
*  It's going to be a big problem. [[02:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10195.0s)]
*  Yeah. And that's and that's also why they've never really locked each other up, [[02:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10196.0s)]
*  why they always pardon one another and all that, because, you know, [[02:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10199.0s)]
*  they know whatever whatever they whatever precedent they say, it could happen to them. [[02:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10203.0s)]
*  Yeah. The pardon thing is why I wouldn't even be shocked. [[02:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10206.0s)]
*  Actually, I don't think Biden can pardon Trump because it's not a federal thing. [[02:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10210.0s)]
*  I think it's a state. The state. It's a state thing. [[02:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10215.0s)]
*  So but I but I wouldn't be surprised if the governor of Georgia pardoned Trump. [[02:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10218.0s)]
*  Interesting. Just to prevent a constitutional crisis, [[02:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10223.0s)]
*  because there's nothing in the Constitution that tells us what to do if a former president goes to prison. [[02:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10226.0s)]
*  Didn't we just talk about that? [[02:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10231.0s)]
*  Someone someone. No, I think. [[02:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10235.0s)]
*  The governor of Georgia doesn't have the power to pardon them. [[02:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10240.0s)]
*  No, I'm thinking they don't. I think someone just told me this. [[02:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10245.0s)]
*  OK, let me see. [[02:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10249.0s)]
*  I think it's one of those weird cases. [[02:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10254.0s)]
*  The governor does not have the authority to grant clemency, [[02:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10256.0s)]
*  although the governor retains indirect influence by virtue of his power to appoint board members. [[02:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10259.0s)]
*  That's what this says when looking at. [[02:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10264.0s)]
*  That's even that's even better. That's crazy. [[02:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10267.0s)]
*  So then he could have the board do it and not take a political hit. [[02:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10269.0s)]
*  Yes, I think it's even more likely not have the authority to hand out pardons. [[02:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10272.0s)]
*  So who can hang out pardons? A five person state board. [[02:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10276.0s)]
*  Interesting. Wow. Interesting. [[02:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10280.0s)]
*  Oh, this is spicy. Interesting. [[02:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10283.0s)]
*  Brian Simpson. I got to wrap this up. Let's get it. [[02:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBZtlsEFzkk&t=10287.0s)]
