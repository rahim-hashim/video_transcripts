# Joe Rogan Experience #1408 - Ed Calderon
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [January 08, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPBejhoKlb8)
*  Welcome back Ed. Good to see you again man. Thank you for having me back. Well I'm happy
*  you're back but I'm not happy that there was a motivation to bring you back based on the
*  violence you know the violence that is going on between the cartels and it was the Mormons
*  and then there was we were just talking about this other person that got shot because they
*  ran what would you explain that again they ran a cartel roadblock? Yeah basically in
*  Tamaulipas a lot of the cartel groups actually make they build their roadblocks in the on the
*  state and local roads and according to what I've heard from some of the people that I know there
*  this family ran one of those roadblocks they didn't know if it was cops or not and they
*  apparently decided to run the roadblock and they the cartel guys shot them. What should
*  do if they encounter a cartel roadblock? Slow down I mean if anything I would probably avoid
*  traveling through those areas that's the number one avoidance usually you know and I've actually
*  gone through some of those myself. Really? Yeah and it's all about they're all they're
*  looking out for the for rivals moving through their territory they're looking for government
*  personnel maybe spying on them and usually it and usually they'll just shake you down for some
*  money and they'll let you go on your way unless you have a four-by-four truck that can use for
*  their you know their own purposes which is. Oh they might take your truck? Yeah specifically
*  in Tamaulipas four-by-four trucks are a commodity for them they use them for their ongoing you know
*  turf war. Oh right especially someone else's that they don't mind getting shot up. Yeah I mean most
*  of the trucks that you see that are up armored or they have the rifles on top are usually stolen
*  vehicles all of them are stolen vehicles and a lot of them are you know Americans crossing into
*  Mexico some of them are Americans crossing into Mexico and just getting the truck stolen. Jesus
*  Christ that's a real common thing? It's starting to be pretty common I recently saw a case of an
*  apparent abduction in in in Tamaulipas you see the video and in the cartel guys come out of the
*  car they grab the the the the owner of a pickup truck they get him out of the car they take his
*  cell phone leave it on the sidewalk because they're aware of all the SOS technology and they take them
*  inside of another car and they take the truck and you thought you would think you know it's it's
*  because he did something or he's involved in something they let him go a few blocks later and
*  just took the truck it was all about the truck. Wow. Yeah it's resources you know they're just
*  acquiring resources for their for the war basically. Nice of them to let them go. Nice of them to let
*  them go you know it's not always the case it's not always the case but it's pretty yeah. I think
*  most people in America are just now waking up to the chaos that's going on down there I think that
*  the Mormon assassination was a real wake-up call but I think people are paying much more attention
*  now I mean we've we talked about this when was the last time you were on it was like five months
*  yeah a lot of the stuff we talked about those five months ago kind of that's how things progressed
*  we actually did mention the Mormon communities down there which was kind of eerie yeah and we
*  talked about the possible designation of cartels as terrorist terror groups. Yeah you had an
*  interesting take on that so Trump was saying that they were gonna designate them as terrorist
*  groups and that they were gonna have military action against them yeah and then there was some
*  sort of negotiation with the president of Mexico what do you think went down there? So I mean this
*  is just you know from what I see and from how things traditionally happen down there Mexico's
*  currently has a current currently a leftist president down there he's very to the left so
*  much to the left that he he recently gave Evo Morales the deposed leftist president of Bolivia
*  asylum in the country and there's been a lot of you know pro-left political stuff going on in
*  Mexico basically as soon as the designation threat by the US came down there was some sort of
*  negotiation and a lot of things happened after after some US officials went down there and talked
*  to the government among them Evo Morales is out he's he went to Cuba apparently and then went to
*  Argentina so he's not gonna stay in Mexico. Former head of public security under the Calderon
*  administration which is two administrations passed the president Calderon is the one that started the
*  drug war he was arrested for cartel involvement and basically receiving money from the cartels
*  I saw that yeah he was going through his immigration process and he was actually asking for full
*  citizenship and they got him on lying through the authority the immigration authorities he said that
*  he'd never received money from the cartels and apparently he did a lot of it right so all these
*  things happened after after they walked back the threat of designating cartels as a terrorist
*  organization so there has been some action so they must have made some negotiation where Trump had
*  said listen we're gonna do this and he said hold up let's let's talk yeah I mean the main thing is
*  one of the things that this current president Andres Manuel Lopez over ran on was creating a
*  national police force right like a National Guard is what he calls it which had already kind of been
*  done before but you know change the name change the uniform change the packaging and it's a new
*  thing right he want he wanted the army out of the drug war because the casualties were mounting on
*  both sides and he said it wasn't a military shouldn't be a military operation and he ran on
*  a platform that was called abrazos no balazos which means hugs not bullets right so basically
*  Jesus Christ amnesty for the cartels was basically kind of the main theme of that so he got into
*  power the first thing he did militarized police forces and create a National Guard and dissolve
*  and try to dissolve the federal police and most of that National Guard force was designated to
*  border patrol duties on the Mexican side so some of them went to the south of the border the southern
*  Mexican border and some of them went to the northern Mexican border basically to stem the
*  whole illegal immigration crisis with the caravans that's what kind of happened and it was a kind of
*  a collaboration between the US and the Mexican government so that was one of the key points of
*  collaboration that they had and when this whole designation thing went up that was kind of like a
*  bargaining chip that the Mexican government had with the US and the rest of the things that kind
*  of transpired afterwards you know it's pretty interesting how a lot of things happened after
*  that meeting down there and how they walked back the terrorist designation so the terrorist
*  designation would mean that Trump would have some sort of incentive to invade Mexico it would it
*  would it would open up the possibility for military direct military action against strikes
*  without permission of the nation that these strikes were going to take place also targeting
*  finances or anything related to cartel activities would be targeted yeah where do the cartels keep
*  their cash well it's it's it's it's right now it's a myriad of things they diversified long
*  ago so it's not like they're keeping buried cash in a container somewhere in the in the
*  jungle like Escobar used to do right right they're still finding some some like rotted
*  cash from the 80s they're putting their money in cryptocurrency they're really yeah they're
*  diversifying their their their investments in actual companies like legit companies so they're
*  cleaning their money that way real estate hotels property on the US side so they're also investing
*  on the US side of the border as well so you know money's it's it's not you know it's not under the
*  mattress or you know giant stacks of cash in a room so what what kind of banks do business with
*  the cartels how do they negotiate that I'm not gonna say names but there's been a few cases of
*  pretty large banks that have been involved in money laundering for the cartels recently and
*  people can look that up easily but you would think you would have a designated cartel you would have
*  cartels designated as terrorists so now their banks involved in funding terrorism so that would
*  change things that's you know there's a lot of things that would happen you know some some of
*  these consequences people talk about as designated as a terrorist and send drones down there things
*  that they kind of don't talk about is that if a terrorist designation does happen most people
*  seeking asylum in the US from Mexico now have the claim of running from terrorists in Mexico so so
*  now they can claim that as far as a you know asylum seeking people can claim that now it's a
*  different thing you know the the main argument that a lot of people say is that cartels aren't
*  can't be considered a terrorist terrorist group because they don't have political aspirations the
*  problem with that theory is that we have a lot of political killings by cartels in Mexico where they
*  shoot the candidate of one side of the political spectrum because it's not good for them so they
*  influence politics they also pay off a lot of politicians down there and they also examples
*  of the new generation cartel from Valhalla giving out Christmas gifts or groceries to the poor
*  basically doing hearts and minds type tactics in the area are clear political movements right yeah
*  so you know how does it tear why is terrorism have to be connected to politics well that's
*  the classical definition of that is of a terrorist group that's what they're basing it on I think
*  the cartels and and and narco terrorism is a thing in and of itself it's a new phenomenon it
*  should be terrorism should be reclassified to include it I think you know most people that live
*  through that type of situation in that type of and that type of area in the country that facing
*  some of these cartel threats that have fled it we'll call it what it is yeah terrorism they're
*  terrified yeah I mean that's literally I mean who's more terrifying than the cartels yeah so
*  what's going on with the Mormons now is are they moving out of there now are they gonna go back
*  to Utah and just take one wife like that's what it all started out with right yeah well the
*  fundamentalist group and they they went down there and kind of proceeded with their customs I'm in
*  contact with it with a few of the members of that family and you know I was in contact before but
*  when I went on here they kind of like one of them reached out hey what's going on so help us out
*  what do we need to do yeah and then you know it was like a friendly hello from them from past
*  interactions and then this happened and you know I kind of advised a little bit but that's you know
*  that it's a mess a lot of them a lot of them are leaving the communities down there there's a lot
*  of them down there a lot of communities and Sonora Coelho and you know they're leaving
*  they're leaving the area it's just too dangerous yeah it only makes sense I mean they just don't
*  have the arms they don't have the tactics manpower and and they're also in the middle of one of the
*  most important regions in Mexico right now for a lot of reasons main thing there's two things that
*  are really really kind of happening in that region one the traffic the trafficking of fentanyl
*  and heroin and all these drugs through one of the main drug routes up into the US and there's a few
*  factions fighting over that region Los Salazar which are a small cartel faction that has allegiance
*  to the Sinaloa cartel and the Linea cartel which is historically been in control of the Sinaloas
*  so they're both kind of buying for control of the area a few hours before the massacre actually
*  took place there were a bunch of firefights between these two factions in the area so one
*  of the main theories is that these this group of Mormons basically were case of mistaken identity
*  kind of driving into some of the areas where they're being protected by some of these people
*  you know it's one theory right the other thing that people kind of need to think about is that
*  the largest mineable deposits of lithium on the planet right now are a few hours away from where
*  that massacre took place really yes and that is you know I'm not conspiracy theory or theorizing
*  here but it's a pretty important thing in that region and there's a lot of interest in that space
*  and control for that space and they're not mining it currently there's a bunch of projects in play
*  right now oh so they've identified the deposits yeah you know people can look up the numbers but
*  it's it's the largest mineable deposit of lithium on the planet well and there was some sort of deal
*  in the past where a Canadian mining agency was going to have rights to it and the mining agency
*  was bought by the check by Chinese company so again after that massacre a lot of things happened
*  a lot of the negotiations happened that problem that deal was one of the things that got killed
*  after that situation oh no right so it's it's it's it's an interesting area there's a lot of
*  things happening there that's got to put a tremendous amount of pressure on the cartels
*  in some way right well historically any sort of any sort of mining operation usually has industry
*  around it which is perfect for the cartels you know extortion protection rackets feeding the
*  the drug use in the area from the workers you know that's is there any way that you could see
*  in the future the cartels being extracted from the positions of power that they're in now I mean or
*  is this something that people in Mexico are gonna have to live with forever and I guess people in
*  the United States as well or is this something that can be fixed you've you've you've talked
*  about before in some of your podcasts and I listen to them a lot great podcast thank you
*  great when you're on too thank you but you talked about legalization how that would help that
*  definitely is part of the solution and it is it is definitely part of the solution legalizing some
*  drugs you know not all drugs are made the same maybe not fentanyl you know yeah but that would
*  help out some things there's there's multiple things that could be done to guide us towards a
*  place where things could stabilize down there and a lot of it is not gonna be able to be done in
*  Mexico it's gonna have to be done up here right basically you know when you have to take care the
*  US has to take care of the drug market up here the illegal drug market and certain things that
*  have happened like legalization of marijuana marijuana and some of some places up here have
*  changed the dynamics of what happens down there some for the better some for some bad some bad
*  things have happened talking to my friend John Norris who was on here as well and comparing notes
*  seeing how a lot of the drug grows there up here the pot illegal pot grows there up here exactly
*  like the ones that I found in Baja six seven years ago and how some of that drug money made
*  from those fields are staying in the US it's not being sent back so that means you have an
*  active growing cartel presence in the US that is US based so I think that one of the problems that
*  people have is perception is that that's a Mexican problem it's a it's a US-Mexico problem
*  you know you have border there but the problem has two root causes right social economic inequality
*  and the stabilization and corrupt government down there and a thriving illegal drug market up here
*  and you know those two have to be solved to set me in a combined way how many members when you
*  combine all the cartels how many members are we talking about that's that means it's pretty
*  hard to put a number on how I will say this more than a million I will say this they defeated the
*  Mexican army in Sinaloa yeah that was bananas yeah when they captured El Chapo's son yeah and
*  then the army gave it back yeah they're like yeah you can have them back well sorry though that
*  whole situation and it was like I remember that was happening and I was getting asked
*  questions about it and it was live it was all of a sudden just popped off you know
*  basically as supposedly official story from the Mexican government is that they send a
*  special police unit to capture him right which is completely false I think because you don't send
*  35 agents to capture one of the the heads of one of the biggest Sinaloa cartel cells right so it's
*  pretty much by chance they spotted this party people were on there they went there all of a
*  sudden Chapo's son is so you think they just stumbled into him there's a I posted a video on
*  my feed of the capture of the El Chapo son you can see it and you can see the surprise and really
*  how the agents are kind of uncomfortable or are fearful of what they just stumbling on imagine
*  US agents stumbling on one of the America's most wanted individuals up here they're gonna put him
*  on the ground they're gonna handcuff him mm-hmm and the video you can see that they point their
*  rifles at him and he calmly takes out his gun and hands it to somebody inside of the inside of the
*  house he was in and walks out and kind of tries to negotiate with the people outside the federal
*  agents are trying to arrest him and you can see that the agents are like oh what did we stumble
*  in on all right so that happened they grabbed them they reported back to Mexico they captured
*  him they started to announce the capture and his brother his half-brother Archibaldo basically
*  called in all of the reinforcements from all surrounding towns and regions and Sinaloa and
*  it was flooded with a bunch of armed cartel guys all of Sinaloa was wasn't there a video of the
*  government people in the cartel people talking yeah there's it's on my feed you can see it if
*  you want it's a it's basically a an army unit that was being sent to reinforce security in
*  Kulig Khan being surrounded by cartel members yeah is this it right here yeah that's it obviously
*  the guys running around with a vest and wearing skinny jeans are some of the Sinaloa cartel members
*  and they just talk it through I mean they're outnumbered and also there's that there's talk
*  about there's a there's a specific community out there in Sinaloa where all the army families
*  members live and they were apparently being held hostage by cartel guys as a bar bargaining chip
*  so all these guys that we're seeing here they're dressed in civilian clothes with the vest those
*  are all cartel guys those are all cartel guys Jesus Christ and that though that shaking hands
*  with everybody well you know hey what's up homie I mean they that again we go back into the whole
*  what what is the fight they have in them right mm-hmm the Sinaloa cartel was basically surrounding
*  some of their communities and hell and holding their family members hostage so that went out
*  over the radio so as an army member going in to fight the cartel so you know what I'm out of this
*  fight yeah so they raise their hands so then they release the hostages everybody backs out yeah I
*  mean there's they defeated the Mexican government basically anything they went up against you know
*  it's around to the city usually you'll see classic classic Mexican cartel activity they close off the
*  streets going into the city by burning semis and trailers and stuff like that so you would see all
*  these burning semi trailers in the region so if you want to move in you can't and if you want to
*  use your helicopters the cartels have entire craft capabilities so they broke out a bunch of
*  people from the prison just taking advantage of the whole chaos you could see there's a few other
*  videos with there's armored trucks with 50 cows and maduces on the back of them just moving around
*  the city there's no way there's no way you can this is a breakout state prison you know took
*  advantage of the whole chaos and just you know just let's let's break some of our friends out
*  so just pure chaos eventually they let the government decided to let him go that's the
*  the official story but according to the people there there was no government saying let him go
*  there was like the guys holding him said you know what it's not worth it yeah that's one of the
*  technicals as they call them up here yeah dump trucks the armor plate the sides and put somebody
*  out imagine being a person living there well that's what I'm trying to picture what life is
*  like for the civilians and most of these videos are all done now by civilians so yeah there's a
*  certain normalcy in some of these cases especially in seen a lot it's part of it's part of the culture
*  and as far as sides go you know hey the army's coming to save us that's not usually what some
*  people in some of these communities think you know because the cartels are those are the guys
*  in charge so seen a low always been like that like how long single has traditionally been been a
*  cradle for like the origins of some of the hot some of the more successful cartel heads right
*  isn't that where Julio Cesar Chavez is from yeah yeah he is yeah and you know a lot lots of lots
*  of anybody that anybody in seen a lot has some sort of relationship to the cartels because they're
*  part of culture there no way getting around it had a surreal experience once when I went there I
*  did a class out there and the was running around this bumpy road and then all of a sudden just flat
*  beautiful road oh yeah this is the cartel part of the road that they built it's like okay so it's
*  like sort of like the mom in Vegas and like the 50s and 60s exactly exactly but it's now and they're
*  way more hardcore way more hardcore you know some of their gravy they have a Jardines de la Maya
*  is called is the narco cemetery they have and it's basically luxury condos they look like I mean I
*  went there I thought it was a church and it turned out to be a tomb Wow right so the the opulence
*  and the money there is just overt you know and and how they move around they roll around in
*  vehicles with guns and nobody does anything because they own the city what can be what are
*  they planning on doing it was anybody have any plans or is it just they're just accepting this
*  well you know you you you get a lot of rhetoric about collaboration yeah that's that's her de
*  nazil Maya all those are graves some of them have CCG video inside air conditioning you know alarms
*  those are graves those are grave sites and the cartel guys heads go there and on the day of the
*  live bands shoot their rakish into the air nobody does anything Wow Jesus Christ this is crazy yeah
*  I mean the opulence is me I mean just seeing it you know it's like having several Escobars in one
*  place you know it's not you know it's like a lot of cart a lot of cartels heads are from that region
*  grew up in that and you know the opulence is amazing fuck like is this gonna grow I think it is I mean I
*  don't think it is it is growing you know again going back to my friend John Norris and having
*  seeing his experiences up here finding all these illegal drug rose and in public lands it's growing
*  it's growing over here too yeah so you roots yeah so I think that a lot of people have to think
*  about a lot of these cartel guys had their kids up here so they made their money down there and
*  they sent their wives up here and a lot of these kids that were born in the late 80s early 90s
*  coming with age up here with that cartel pedigree so and their US citizens US passport so you're
*  gonna you're gonna see some sort of shift and you know they're coming of age it'll get experience
*  you get you know a handoff of rains from the older generation to a newer generation you're
*  gonna see definitely it's definitely growing it seems so crazy to watch because it seems like
*  it's not discussed nearly enough and it it seems like if it keeps getting stronger like what we saw
*  with El Chapo Sun being released what it what's the stop it from taking over Mexico entirely well
*  I mean you would have people arguing that it already has in different ways so I think another
*  thing that people kind of have to kind of figure out and realize is that there's factions in Mexican
*  the Mexican government so you will see a federal government that apparently is being paid off by
*  a very specific large cartel group and then you'll see state governments that are different political
*  influenced paying off by other cartel groups so you'll see you know military units moving
*  on the town and the state police blocking their way to get in there because they're
*  played for different teams right whoa you know there's a there's a lot of talk right now about
*  Felipe Calderon's tenure and how his head of secure a head of public safety was on the payroll
*  of the Sinaloa cartel which actually came out during El Chapo's trial so now you're talking
*  about basically a federal police force that was on El Chapo's side so he had free reigns to grow
*  and do whatever he had to do in that region with the support of the federal government in a way so
*  technically you know who's in control of some regions and realistically some regions of Mexico
*  are completely in cartel control now we discussed this on the last podcast but let's give people a
*  little just a recap of this just so people can understand your position when you first started
*  working on for the with the the Mexican government with this it wasn't like it is now it was so what
*  you give everybody just a rundown of how it went down so I went to I went to work for for state
*  government down in Mexico in Baja specifically and this was in this was 2004 right right before
*  the start of the official start of the kickoff of the drug war as a kickoff the kickoff but there
*  was you know that the official start was when Felipe Calderon came into office said you know
*  what gloves off gonna go after the organized crime right we're gonna send the military into
*  into this onto the streets and they're gonna head up spearhead operations against the cartels
*  but before that things were happening still you know Sinaloa cartel was growing there was a
*  rift between the Sinaloa cartel and Tijuana cartel fragmentation cartel heads were being
*  killed and one cartel turned to three all this fragmentation and then you know they basically
*  militarized the war on drugs with Calderon came in militarized war on drugs immediately you start
*  seeing that drug enforcement efforts were being put towards a single or a group of cartel groups
*  but not the but not a major one like Sinaloa cartel so you start seeing how they were basically
*  taking sides they're breaking up the competition that's what you would gather from making it look
*  like progress yeah and and also Ochapo has been built up into this mythical figure like he was
*  the head of the Sinaloa cartel he's the main guy that's not true at all he was an operator
*  for the Sinaloa cartel but not the main operator you know there's different theories and about who
*  is actually who was actually in charge or the brain is behind the whole operation when you say
*  Sinaloa cartel is not one group it's several it's a federation of several criminal groups
*  enterprises uniting and working in conjunction to put drugs into the into the United States well one
*  of the things they do is put drugs into the United States they do a lot of things but that's one of
*  the things they do so you know certain people there's a lot of people out there that theorize
*  that El Mayo Sambada which is Ochapo's compadre who's still out there is the actual head of the
*  Sinaloa cartel and has been since the start but you see how some of these people become celebrities
*  and as soon as somebody becomes a celebrity like Ochapo who escaped from custody a few times you
*  know under you know pretty interesting situations that means pretty interesting situations now the
*  government has a celebrity that can go after so they can point at that guy that guy's a bad guy
*  right so you saw a lot of that a lot of theatrics around him as far as him being the head of whatever
*  you know group or operation was but at the same time you started seeing you know the DEA and the
*  US government can decorating and putting all these awards on a guy like Luna who was the guy that got
*  arrested recently who was head of security down in Mexico and now all of a sudden he's now no he's
*  not you know he was recognized by the US government as being a player for the good guys and now he's
*  arrested so you start seeing all these you know different interests different political kind of
*  movements around the drug war and what that turned into and you know what you don't know what they
*  think right each and each also each US administration has changed the way they do things when it comes to
*  the drug war and also benefits certain groups down there so you know who knows realistic rock yeah it's
*  just you know I went to Chichen Itza I think in 2002 maybe 2003 somewhere around though that time
*  and there was no concern yeah yeah it's a different time yes but that's 16 17 years ago that's so
*  recent in terms of like human history yeah that a region changes so radically so quickly well it's
*  it's there's a lot of things happening you know there's a lot of interest China has a lot of
*  interest in Mexico and you go back and you see some things like this I'm sorry you see things
*  like the whole how some armed groups started popping up in Mexico in the Michoacan area
*  fighting back against the cartels the the whole there was like series like a documentary on them
*  the the out of the fence as they would they were called basically like vigilante groups and then
*  you later on you realize that they were all fighting for basically protecting or ink or working
*  around security for illegal Chinese or my mining in the area whoa yeah it was all about a Chinese
*  or mining iron ore mining illegal Chinese or mine so the Chinese or miners they just made a deal yeah
*  and then you know that's we can get in on it so let's arm all these guys and we're protecting our
*  communities but there was a lot of that going on not all of them but a lot of there was a lot of
*  shady stuff going on in the region and when it comes to that now you see things like the stuff
*  that's going on in Sonora and there's a lot of lithium there that's pretty valuable thing you
*  know Sonora is a place that a lot of hunters go yeah Sonora has these big hunting ranches and
*  it's like it's famous for giant mule deer yeah yeah yeah I've been out there hunting myself and
*  it's a it's a beautiful it's a beautiful part of Mexico but that seems like a sketchy spot to
*  it's venturing it's perfect because it's it's perfect for them because it's rural so there's
*  nobody around but if you were like a guy from Texas want to drive your truck down there to
*  a little hunting I mean not my recommendation is this if you have a four by four don't don't
*  take it down there take a fucking you go we do have the largest population of American citizens
*  living outside of the country in Mexico for some reason so really yeah in all throughout Mexico
*  yeah I mean all throughout Mexico fun down there well a lot of people like Cabo people love Mexican
*  food yeah yeah yeah there's there is there's a certain chaotic freedom in Mexico which I'll be
*  on being some a child of Mexico and then moving up here and seeing you guys talk about freedom
*  yeah not that but but there's there's I get the I get the draw you know and some of these communities
*  safe but some aren't you know they're safe until they're not safe and safe until they until they
*  all of a sudden you're in the middle of a some place that is going to be disputed which is I
*  think is something along the lines of what happened to some of these Mormon communities down there
*  mmm you know you're on your you're in the middle of your community and your movements are in the
*  middle of our route could you please get out of the way what's the ceiling on this like if they can
*  continue to grow I mean it's it's really is it possible that we're looking at a country that
*  might be completely run and overrun by criminal organizations and drug sellers some parts of it
*  are already so what I think is gonna happen is you'll see escalations a clear sign or a clear
*  group that is like a sign of things to come is the is the new generation cartel the new generation
*  cartel is a cartel that was it used to be called Los Matacetas there was basically an armed
*  enforcing group that seen a law cartel made to go after their main rivals the set does which were
*  originally members of special Mexican Special Forces that said you know what we're gonna be
*  cartel guys now and cartel enforcers now so they whole sordid history these it was a militarized
*  group that was formed formed to go after them right and their whole kind of play was that we're
*  gonna be against extortion against abducting people against affecting the community we're
*  gonna enforce the law in our communities but we're also gonna move drugs through here right but that
*  you know that's kind of their thing so you see this group started kind of growing in the region
*  and right now it's pretty big it's rivaling the scene a lot of cartel as far as power and reach
*  but the way they do their things is militarized it's very militaristic and kind of paramilitary
*  and it kind of reminds me a little bit about of the like the the FARC groups in Colombia
*  hearts and minds they go into the communities the community policing in the area they originally
*  said you know we're aware the government wants to fight drugs here in the region we agree with
*  their fight but we are also gonna fight against these guys that are affecting the community as
*  well and they have like groups of people they have they have training camps the military
*  militaristic training camps where they recruit people they take them there and they're being
*  trained in guerrilla warfare and shooting and apparently there's some SF guys from the US that
*  that advise them so that's that's the next thing the ex the the escalation of a simple rag tag
*  group of cartel guys enforcing a region to an actual cohesive paramilitary group now trying to
*  vie for control not just of the of the drug routes but also of the populace and the confidence of
*  the populace has in them so it could turn political at some point right it just seems like it's the
*  genies out of the bottle it hit I mean it is I mean it is in a lot of ways and going after it just
*  as a drug enforcement issue is not you know so much bigger than that yeah it's a cultural it's
*  economic you know some of these kids I've posted up some of these cartel soldier kids of 12 years
*  old plated guns gold plated guns you know they don't have an op they don't have options in their
*  life right it's that or nothing right it's either awesome life or short awesome extreme poverty short
*  life yeah short awesome life or extreme poverty so that's one component to it another component
*  is systemic corruption as a society from who knows when you know it's always been a thing in
*  Mexico people that grew up down there you get stopped at a red light and you're like can I pay
*  the fine here you know people that are from down there will be aware of this yeah show you the
*  children paperwork you slide that thing in there you know that's you know that's part of the culture
*  that's affecting a lot of things as well you know people don't pay attention to the small rules so
*  the big rules don't matter right and just being next to the largest drug market on the planet you
*  know and having money firearms rounds going down and fentanyl that is being fabricated in
*  Mexico now and some of the Chinese fentanyl making its way through into the US kind of filling the
*  voids that some of the drug market has right now so they're making fentanyl-laced fake fentanyl-laced
*  pills that are gonna be there being put into the US and fentanyl-laced heroin right so that's
*  where they're going towards now that's why you see this epidemic up here and a lot of things
*  traditionally kind of focused on pot before it was legalized and a lot of readings up here now is
*  heroin and fentanyl so it's actually kind of accelerated the production of the more harmful
*  and dangerous drugs in some ways yes I mean they had to find another you know it was it went pot
*  meth and now fentanyl-laced heroin or fentanyl-laced pills see in the problem with the idea of
*  legalization is that if you try to be the person who says hey folks we need to legalize drugs here
*  in America because we've got this problem with the cartels politically that's suicide yeah no
*  no one I mean even though it's probably right it is I think it is I think it is very right it's one
*  of those things that's so counterintuitive that most people are gonna go you're crazy you're gonna
*  make my kids hooked on drugs well I'll say this I was I fought in the drug war I literally a drug war
*  veteran yeah and if I had a white flag I would hand it over to you you know it's like I that
*  it's a useless fight I got to destroy pot fields realistically thinking about all the effort and
*  all the blood I'm like it's just pot yeah and it's so quick to grow back I mean it yeah it is it is
*  a fruitless fight fentanyl heroin maybe different drugs fentanyl in particular but a lot of that
*  fentanyl is coming from China it's not a Mexican thing oh yeah a lot of people that are making
*  or producing fentanyl in places like Mexico are from China setting up laboratories in Mexico
*  so it's a it's a Chinese Mexican US problem as well god damn what can be done other than the
*  legalization what can be done I mean how does and unless the United States literally goes to war
*  with the Mexican cartels and you made a face talking about that I mean I'd say designation
*  is one of I think that's a nation should it's going to happen a terrorist designation it's
*  going to happen I mean again we just saw the murder the massacre of Mexican they were dual
*  citizenship nine people kids women it's not uncommon for that to happen to Mexican nationals
*  it's pretty uncommon for that to happen to American nationals down there and that woke up woke up a
*  bunch of people you know and now we another recent murder of another American national you
*  know kid with his parents down there you know people will say but just don't go down in Mexico
*  but some of these people you know live down there have family down there have communities down there
*  it's just ultra violent you know people have to wake up on this side to realize this problem is
*  not going to get any better this problem is not just a Mexican problem it's a US Mexican problem
*  and you know it'll get to a point where it's going to be you know I think in my lifetime
*  there's going to be some sort of arm intervention in Mexico at some point really so you anticipate
*  almost like in a civil war I think something's going to happen in Mexico it's going to be
*  stabilized so much that the US won't have another option but to put put something around probably
*  that's I think that's that's where we're headed the problem and again another another of the
*  problems is that the government is part of the problem so you can go down there and negotiate
*  with this government but six years later it's going to be another government you got to
*  renegotiate with them yeah and also you palm grease yeah and then you put all your faith in
*  the military and the military gets compromised you put all the faith in you and the Mexican marines
*  and then they get compromised and now who do you have right so it's systemic
*  don't tell that to Trump he'll use that as an excuse we can't count on them we're going in
*  I mean I wonder where it all goes because it is obviously growing very fast it's obviously
*  huge and incredibly powerful and and it affects I mean I'm I'm up here now and I could see the
*  effects of it up here walking through LA seeing all the needles on the ground going to Seattle
*  seeing the same light brown fentanyl lace heroin that I saw in Chanty towns down Baja
*  it's like wow so this is where it kind of ends up yeah so you you and you see the effects of it
*  throughout so you know you realize quickly as somebody from both sides that I am you realize
*  that they're realistically there's no there's kind of no border when it comes to this problem
*  it's this problem doesn't respect a border wall right right submarines will go around it tunnels
*  will go under it drones will fly over it and it's a it's a problem that just keeps you know producing
*  an effect and I think the majority of the United States citizens are completely unaware of the
*  complexity and the depth of the problem yeah I mean it is it's also I think most people
*  seeing the Iran thing right now most people know more about that oh yeah going off going on halfway
*  across the world yeah then what's going on just you know if you are that's what's crazy to me it's
*  like you know we're we're into invading countries that are really barely affecting us they're like a
*  17-hour plane flight yeah I think I think the uh I don't know again I don't I don't want to be
*  edadamas and you know predict stuff edadamas but uh the the fact that we have a lot of lithium
*  in Sonora is going to be a factor for a reason to clean it up it should be it should be it's
*  pretty important it's a pretty important resource yeah but if they can't hold on to El Chapo's son
*  how the that's that's why I think the U.S. is going to have to you know put boots on the ground down
*  there wow now if you had to make a bet like if there's a betting line in Vegas like how many
*  how many days or how many years from now would they be American soldiers deployed to Mexico I
*  I'd say five years maybe whoa five years really I mean we we are on we just passed this this past
*  year has been the most violent year in Mexico in recorded history really and it's the first
*  year of the administration of this new president right who's been trying to hugs hugs uh hugs not
*  not bullets abracos no balazos you know this instead of that uh it's been his first year and
*  you know hey give him a chance he's he's he's doing whatever he's only the most violent year
*  in history yeah cut the guy a break exactly that's what they say but then I go down there
*  and I have a lot of a lot of my friends that are still down there people that I've trained
*  still down there and I hear from them directly like I have some uh young kids that are in the
*  Jandarmaria which is like a federal police force that patrols all of Mexico and some of the federal
*  police guys they tell me like Ed we're they they said or you signed the new contract to be
*  water than as of now and lower your pay and all your all of the stuff that all your benefits will
*  be gone or you just stay on here in limbo and just stay at the base and a lot of them are staying at
*  the base so it's nothing nothing's nothing's nothing's being done well I imagine that if it
*  seems overwhelming and it seems helpless and it seems like the cartels are just taking over and
*  they're making a shitload of money and you're not making any money I mean that that is the real
*  crazy thing about it right there if the the government is asking people in this sort of
*  already compromised situation environment asking them to work for a small amount of money to go
*  after people that are making a tremendous amount of money yeah and you're going to be at war with
*  these people these people they're basically your neighbors yeah and also you go there with a federal
*  uniform as part of the federal government you go into a community where you the federal government
*  doesn't do anything for them right the church is made by the cartels cartel made the road
*  christmas was brought brought to you by the cartels you know they they are the good guys so these guys
*  come in here like who are these guys like what are they doing here we're not gonna so that's you know
*  it's it's it's it's it is it's a mess it's a mess wow but could boots on the ground actually fix anything
*  I mean I'm not I'm not a I'm not a military expert but uh there has to be some sort of outside force
*  that is completely uncompromised by cartel money and influence how long before they compromise those
*  people well uh when you put the marines on the border a few of them got picked up on smuggling
*  people uh from the border so yeah that's what I'm saying you know who knows it's it's it's and it's
*  also it's a different war field because a lot of you know a lot of our war fighters in law enforcement
*  are have some sort of blood ties to mexico of course well not only that I was just watching some
*  video where there was this guy who uh is a u.s veteran been deployed overseas fought for this
*  country and his mom was getting deported and he said he felt betrayed like here here he is in
*  america his his mother brought him over here had him over here he's a u.s citizen and they're
*  deporting his mom as if his mom was a danger or a problem there's a community of of army marine
*  and several veterans that are deported veterans that live in in place like dijuana that's fucking
*  crazy uh that is fucking crazy you fight for the country man you got a doi in here but how
*  nuts is that it is pretty nuts it's fucking ridiculous you fight for this country you you
*  literally risk your life and there's assholes out there that haven't done a goddamn thing been
*  mooching off the system forever and they're citizens and you're not yeah I mean my perspective
*  in my life life path you know when I came up here I want I want to earn it right I don't know I
*  came up here motivated want to do a difference work uh and apparently you know I've had I've
*  had some you know static in my in my endeavors uh my kid was born in the u.s and uh parented her mom's
*  american right when I went to uh to the hospital to pay for uh the the the uh insurance uh part of it
*  they laughed at me and said you shouldn't pay any of this you're mexican you just can claim benefits
*  right that that was in California so that was like oh but I can afford it
*  no you should just you should there's ways around this you know and that's when I knew you know
*  there's America and there's California America right California America is different yeah
*  California America is very different it's a subtle blend oh I mean there's there's ways around stuff
*  you know there's free stuff you know get it get it get at it you know you know it's a weird you
*  know again I travel across the country just get to experience different parts of the u.s
*  you know I spent new years in Kentucky and that's pretty interesting oh it's I mean I like it you
*  know maybe it's like a it's like a white Mexico is it yeah how so uh people were shooting guns
*  into the air and on years eve that's pretty mexican you know they do that in Texas too oh
*  well you know again you know I don't know it's it's not good some lady got shot oh it's completely
*  responsible in her driveway grandma with her family and the bullet fell out of the sky and hit
*  her in the chest yeah when we when you would come we would park underneath the the bridges
*  in Baja to not get you know there's firearms are illegal in Mexico and then you know
*  tracing around trace around just going oh my god like trace around okay you know it's it's it's
*  again Mexico is a weird place you know that's why I call it the upside down you know um you know
*  there's the there's there's a chaotic freedom to Mexico which I get I mean I love my I love Mexico
*  as a country as a culture I don't like the government though the government is just you
*  know at all levels it's just you know it's not a good well it seems like it's always been that
*  way I'm reading this book about Kit Carson and the old west and when the United States
*  you know conquered parts of California and took over parts of California and in the west from
*  Mexico and it was crazy back then yeah yeah and they were talking about the the chaos in
*  in the Mexican government and the Mexican military back then in the 1800s yeah yeah I mean uh so
*  so people have kind of figured realize uh if if you want to be an officer in the in the Mexican army
*  uh you have to go through war college and there's different ways to go about it
*  but there's a lot of hereditary stuff going on hereditary like hey my dad was your general
*  okay you know there's a lot of that going on also the army down there has a monopoly over selling
*  guns it's only one gun store in all of Mexico and it's run by the army what yep one gun store in
*  all in all of Mexico and it's run by the army and you have to fly to Mexico City to to get a license
*  and to procure a firearm so if you live in the Yucatan you have to fly to Mexico you gotta fly
*  to Mexico City to get a gun which makes which basically makes the only options buying a gun on
*  the black market or flying over there and expending all this money so there's a now it's a class so
*  only only people that can afford the plane ticket and to do this process are the ones that can have
*  guns so it's a that's class you know class is involved in there as well what kind of rights do
*  you have with guns versus the United States second amendment is it somewhere so the constitution the
*  Mexican constitution allows for guns for self-defense but a lot of amendments and a lot of corrupt
*  governments on their side you're not a good idea to have this here so progressively throughout
*  Mexican recent Mexican history it's become more and more strict right certain rounds aren't allowed
*  certain calibers aren't allowed and this just plainly the sale of firearms in all of Mexico
*  is just relegated to a single gun store in Mexico City so you can't carry them without a without a
*  permit and to get a permit you have to know somebody that knows the Presidente or a general
*  or something well what about all those gentlemen we saw in that video just walking in front of
*  those government agents with with guns why didn't they arrest them they should have they should have
*  seems like those well the only people that respect those laws are you know
*  law-abiding citizens there was a case in uh veracruz of an old man a former army guy old
*  older gentleman uh he his son tried to get abducted and some something like that he had this old
*  Mauser rifle and he shot dead one of the guys that was chasing him was trying to abduct him
*  he was arrested for the the firearm possession and Mauser is what Lee Harvey Oswald supposedly
*  used on JFK yeah that's an old-ass gun well there's a lot of weird old-ass stuff down there you
*  we I mean as far as the stuff that gets handed over or just the weird exotic firearms down there
*  a lot of people call Mexico the US's garage and likely like garages you just find weird stuff down
*  there from old world war two-error pistols and explosives to uh new stuff like there's a friend
*  of mine uh that works for the government down there told me that they found a bunch of uh
*  parts for a minigun in a house somewhere down there what's a minigun it's basically a
*  remember that go ahead remember that Terminator 2 yeah that thing oh yeah yeah yeah it's pretty
*  hard to get yeah one of those uh apparently there's one out there somewhere uh on a vehicle
*  of some sort oh jesus it's basically a they'll obliterate everything well we talked about the
*  Ed Holder fast and furious deal last time that you were here and that to me still is one of the most
*  bizarre cases in in the history of an undercover operation that doesn't make any sense at all
*  yeah they sold guns like literally sold working guns to a specific cartel down there to try to
*  so they could track them or I don't remember what kind of bullshit argument that was but the the
*  the interesting part or if you want to go into the you know the questions that they benefited a single
*  cartel the senile cartel that's the uh that's the thing you know that's most of the guns went to
*  that if you had a guess if you were a conspiracy theorist like put on your tin foil hat what do you
*  think that was all about uh they were probably as a as a as a nation you were probably wanting to
*  only worry about a single threat as far as cartels and not a lot of cartels so they empowered one
*  cartel yeah really I mean that was coming off the uh Patriot Act era Bush era thing I remember
*  vividly people putting Geiger counters in some of the drug tunnels that we would find so they were
*  worried about nukes getting put into drug tunnels at some point during during that whole post-911 era
*  so it would make sense that if you are worried about national security you would want to not
*  worry about a lot of cartels maybe focus on one support one and just keep us in the know do you
*  think this was a covert operation in a sense of that the Sinaloa cartel was not aware that they
*  were doing this to empower them to eliminate the competition to strengthen one group because
*  they just knew it was inevitable that someone there's a lot of control there's a lot of people
*  that are now coming out after the the whole uh there's a lot of things that were said at the
*  Chapo trial that are that would lead somebody to believe that there was some sort of official
*  support from the U.S. government to the Sinaloa cartel as far as them having deals with these
*  this cartel specifically to keep things to keep them in the know about things happening down there
*  supporting them to be that be in a position so they can keep control over their region
*  and basically as an information group so they can have have a clear eye and ear in a chaotic area
*  like Mexico on the bad guy side that's what I that's why I gather from it Jesus Christ
*  but that kind of it's it's almost like they feel like it's helpless like they have to do something
*  like that that they have to do that because there's no way to fix it so what you got to do
*  is kind of try to manage it or move it in certain directions well there's there's there's all like
*  every night every now and then I post some stuff about that uh type of situation and everybody
*  goes to well the CIA has been running drugs into the U.S. for years and using planes and stuff like
*  that there is there are instances of CIA involvement and different stuff down in Mexico that
*  you know are pretty obvious now from the 80s and the 90s as far as supporting certain groups or
*  just trying to keep tabs on these people but you know I think we're coming to a point in our history
*  where a lot of these people are dead a lot of these people are in jail a lot of these people
*  got book deals and a lot of these people are talking and you're I mean it's interesting seeing
*  some of the stuff that is coming out now that in my time when I was active would have gotten you
*  in a hole probably somewhere if you talked about it so there was definitely I mean I I I my mind
*  was blown when I was seeing El Chapo on Netflix because a lot of stuff that was going on in that
*  show is fictionalized stuff that I went through myself so it's like this is on Netflix now how
*  accurate was it there's some pretty good accurate parts so there's a there's a character in that
*  show called we're talking about narcos and we're talking about the Mexican version of narcos right
*  because there's a there's a being first yeah there there's a narcos is pretty good there's a there's
*  a el chapo series on Netflix as well oh there is yeah it's in Spanish it's very popular but it's
*  pretty accurate there's a guy in that in the subtitles it does uh there's a guy in the show
*  uh Conrado Sol is his name which would nobody would people were trying to figure out who that
*  was is basically a government uh guy that had to deal with El Chapo and they both kind of escalated
*  in power it turns out it was Luna right so this show was showing him the character uh El Sol which
*  depicts Luna as a corrupt politician that was working security was working both sides and all
*  of a sudden you know recently a few months a few weeks back they arrested the guy wow so the show
*  was kind of predicted do you think that the show had anything to do with him being arrested
*  i mean it probably put i put the idea in the zeitgeist of people to ask questions
*  you know yeah that's weird that shows actually do do that like saving surviving R. Kelly that's what
*  got him arrested i mean everybody knew he was peeing on people and like 20 years ago he's
*  peeing on little kids you know and now it gives people like a good it's interesting you see you
*  see fictionalized forms of stuff that happened down there the narco show as well is another thing you
*  know see fictionalized things of how some of these powerful cartel groups kind of originated
*  themselves in fiction and now that is in the public uh kind of domain as far as collective
*  knowledge so people start asking questions and some of these things apparently people in power
*  also ask questions as well jesus christ it's just uh it's so strange how popular it's become
*  you know and it's such a uh a popular focal point of fiction as well and in fashion yeah
*  el chapo's picture with uh champagne yeah the shirt was like fire everybody wanted that shirt
*  you know that uh connor mcgregor like wore something to mimic it when on purpose when he's
*  in the press conference for hafel dos angios did you know that yeah he stood in the same stance
*  like look at him look at him i mean he's doing it on purpose yeah it's like a subtle nod to el chapo
*  yeah i mean he's a chapo has achieved legendary status now for sure now his kid that was freed
*  by the uh the uh the cartel down there he was wearing a scapulario which is like um you could
*  i don't know if you can see it in there that's an interesting just a piece of a cultural thing
*  from mexico what is going on in this video that we're watching so he just handed the gun over
*  his personal gun over to one of his bodyguards that was not even these guys don't even care about
*  him this is a head head head camera thing and they're putting everybody out there and
*  personally i would put everybody in zip ties and on the ground personally so these guys all have
*  guns drawn and there's people inside with guns drawn at them and they realize they realize who
*  they have now so they're like uh should we forcefully put them in cuffs should we not
*  so how do you know that they're realizing this right is it because of the language
*  all of what they're saying i've went through a lot of the same training that they went through and
*  i did a lot of this type of stuff and all of them would have been in zip ties on the ground
*  look at this girl went reached out and grabbed their guns and put their guns down there's there's
*  fear in these people they realize that they messed up oh jesus right so that's what you know
*  people question and are these streaming this video live they they have them in the head cam
*  they have a head cam and they're streaming it not well it's not you know they they they they have
*  recording recording it and it gets sent back to the command post so when he was moving around he
*  had one of these on this is a scapulario it's called it's like a religious catholic iconography
*  thing what is yours what is it uh this is a santa marta one right it's like a holy death effigy so
*  he had that on he had his was a santo niño la tocha which is like a catholic christ baby saint they
*  have as soon as that picture of him went on online they were sold out all throughout sinaloa everybody
*  was wearing that they have to work you know they work those work because got him free got him free
*  there he is that's the that's a scapulario handsome guy yeah that's an also an interesting
*  cultural thing uh the the occult part of it where that's that's something you that tocha shrine is
*  right now it's probably most popular shrines in mexico or that one because they work and then you
*  go to the holy death shrines down there as well and you see how how both sides both mexican government
*  forces and the cartel they they both benarie kind of the same saints so it's that again that's a
*  weird kind of uh thing they share that faith what is that picture of his truck down there jamy you
*  have some wacky truck now it's just a regular truck uh that's his yeah that's one of his
*  riddled with bullets uh he gave out cars on christmas he as a like he did this party to
*  any like towns people where he was how many cars did he give out i have no idea like a lot of them
*  there's pictures of the el chapo's son gives out cars on christmas and there's a bunch of cars there
*  you know again who who are you like who who are you gonna go towards him of course government
*  you know you give me a car you don't give me anything yeah they they like you said hearts and
*  minds they're really yeah minds and and and uh you know uh they they they pay for college
*  education so there's a whole generation of lawyers a whole generation of doctors
*  they pay for immigration uh procedures so hey you wanna you know yeah i'll pay for your immigration
*  but you know i'm gonna call in some favors later on okay wow so that that's you know that's that's
*  how that's how you grow it's full-on mafia shit yeah i mean they they learned one day i'll come
*  to you al capone al capone uh you know scarface uh you know all these things are kind of venerated
*  by them that's kind of their cultural backing they have pop cultural backing uh they kind of
*  look to the mob era guys as influence or as inspiration you see you know insane paintings
*  of uh the godfather or or scarface in some of these safe houses where these people are right
*  and you're like okay or you see cartel influenced uh series for netflix like uh there's one called
*  la reina del sur which is about a female uh cartel head um and the the lady that that stars
*  in that show was the one that took chan pan down there to meal chapel because oh no chapel was a
*  fan of that show right really that's how it got going when they finally caught up to him he had
*  the whole series on dvds at his which is pretty he humanized them a little bit oh my god that
*  that whole scene with sean penn going down there and writing a story for rolling stone was
*  uber bizarre yeah well if if they get the the terrorist designation he basically went down
*  there to meet with the terrorist what happens to him then is it uh retroactive i don't know
*  i don't know but they he helped get him arrested in in a sense right he basically that whole
*  commotion put eyes on on the movements of el chapo by the mexican government why would el
*  chapo agree to do something like that he was a fan of the show
*  that seems so crazy though doesn't it seem crazy that he was willing to take that kind of a risk
*  and take a photo with sean penn and that that actress well what's her name again
*  cut the cut the castillo yeah right there he was chapo's probably banging that right
*  if i had a guess there's rumors there's rumors of of a meeting that's about it i don't know
*  anything else if i have a guess i'll say yes but it's just the whole thing look at sean penn smiling
*  hey here's my friend the murderer well i mean um i get the i i mean i've heard some of the stuff
*  sean penn said about you know chavez and venezuela and stuff like that how he's pro chavez and stuff
*  like that i have people friends of mine that live in venezuela under that regime
*  so he's a pretty kooky guy he has some pretty interesting ideas about he can't possibly be
*  that informed i don't know i mean how you you really have to have boots on the ground to
*  understand what the fuck you're talking about and you have to be there for you know if you want to
*  know what's going on in venezuela there's so many different stories my friend abby martin's been
*  down there multiple times and she gives me a story that's so different than anything that you're
*  getting in mainstream news and she goes there she goes there and talks to people yeah spends time
*  i have a there's a there's a resistance group that is based in the u.s that works down there
*  and you know they put up videos all the time of people picking up garbage and trying to recycle
*  garbage to feed themselves in some places instagram immediately takes all those downs
*  right really yeah why does instagram take those down i have a lot of that going on as well when
*  i post something completely news related about something and then get shadow banned or things
*  just go down depending on what i post up like weird things posted up a venezuelan people throwing
*  rocks at this armored vehicle and one of them i think one of them got run over and that got taken
*  down i didn't show the the part where he got run over but just the people protesting
*  and how would that get taken down it got flagged as support for a hate group or something like that
*  support for a hate group by showing the news yeah or showing a picture of cartel and again i don't
*  post anything graphic on my feed because i don't want to get banned but i'm still shadow banned
*  right so well you showed that one by the way uh ed manifesto that's how you find it ed manifesto
*  that's uh that that's ed's page um you posted that one where you you saw a guy getting abducted
*  yeah by fake cops yeah yeah and and that one get pulled yeah it did yeah all of the all of the
*  recent sinaloa video ones are all were all pulled off the instagram account that's why i had to
*  re-upload them all i just don't understand their logic i mean look i can understand them
*  um saying caution some of these images and videos are sensitive you know like with some
*  bloody things and things on those lines something changed in the algorithms a year back like when i
*  was on your first time i was on your show i got obviously i saw a spike thank you by the way
*  but all of the uh pro second amendment uh pages and uh people like there's a guy crispy
*  it was uh yeah and you know also he got a lot all of a sudden all of a start seeing a lot of
*  us are flagged yeah his stuff got taken down yeah and i think he got a there was a photo of him
*  with donald trump that got taken down yeah i like that or i think it was donald trump jr like what
*  the fuck is wrong with you people yeah just because you don't align with someone politically
*  you can't take down photos and you can't pretend that he's posing with hitler or something like
*  yeah what the fuck is wrong with you it's it's uh it's the people can report things anonymously i
*  think and yes and if you hurt my feelings there you go so if there's enough people that flag your
*  video and say this is hurtful or this is they don't even look into it they just pull it down
*  yeah so who do you think is doing do you think this mexican government is doing that do you
*  think it's the cartels that are doing that i think it's mostly americans that have sensibilities that
*  are completely beyond my comprehension that uh see a gun in a in a picture and they're afraid
*  of the gun and it's a terrorist and they're supporting terrorism hate group let's report
*  that picture or video well i could understand how some of what you're reporting on truthful as it
*  may be would be disturbing to be able to find out that truth but you gotta let people do that i mean
*  i mean what does instagram want to do i mean do they want to put parameters on what kind of truth
*  you're allowed to distribute so uh just for people to get some context i i do work for two
*  two magazine companies and i do do articles so in that regard i do provide news in in in in certain
*  ways um but when i post something on my page it's a personal view of something i purposefully don't
*  go into graphic material because i don't want to get flagged but sometimes there's always people
*  with a certain affinity to when they see a gun in a post or where they see an animal being butchered
*  uh for something like in a picture or when they see hunting related stuff or when they see some
*  sort of i remember posting up a picture of the make tijuana great again hats that they were making
*  down there red hats that said make tijuana great again when the caravans went into tj and people
*  started protesting caravans in tj that got flagged what that is so crazy oh
*  you know if you want to confuse if you want to make people angry and confused just wear one of
*  those hats through the airport yeah well a lady got maced in the face for wearing one that said
*  make bitcoin great again yeah some guy maced her in the face yeah i saw her hat off i saw somebody
*  walk in an airport with a make hentai great again hat make anything great again you can't do it
*  it's too close yeah it's too close i mean you know that the hat you know i've never seen anything
*  more divisive in this country i mean other than like a swastika or something like overtly disgusting
*  i started my immigration process when he got elected oh no
*  so it's it's it's been a trip you know how does that work like if you are a mexican born citizen
*  and you want to become a united states citizen obviously it's very difficult it so married to
*  an american have an american kid that's how i went through the process myself and uh you know i got
*  a green card um the the thing is that when he got elected everybody said you know what maybe our time
*  to get a green card is going to get be less and less so let's all try and get one so what would
*  take normally six months to two years oh wow so in those two years you can't leave the country
*  so if you what happens to people that are illegal that's what's fucked up about it right
*  it's like there's people that came over here illegally 20 30 years ago and they've done no
*  crimes they've been an integral part of society they've had great lives but they they can't pay
*  taxes they can't vote they have to live undercover yeah i mean fuck that's stupid they're they're uh
*  you know and they do provide you know they do provide they pay taxes through other other sales
*  tax buying things but they're not paying taxes they're not but if you made them citizens you
*  would make money yeah well it's not a popular view it's a stupid view yeah it's it's it's stupid
*  that we have these people and they're permanent illegals yeah and they will be here until they
*  die illegally and we know they're here like how about work with what you've got like you've already
*  you're doing your best to stop the border traffic great fantastic but listen let's just forget about
*  the past these people are here they're here and they're a part of our community like how you how
*  are you going to deny them citizenship till the day they die and they're still here well legal
*  immigration just like i went through is hard enough you gotta find some american lady that's
*  just difficult yeah i did you know and uh you know but it it was a hard process uh it's uh it's it's
*  it's a difficult process and you speak fluent english i yes that's another thing i saw people
*  in the line with me uh you know that did not speak a lick of english but they were from a
*  country that had a quota great fine like holland or some shit from a country that has a quota so
*  they're great but you're not you're not yeah it's hard for canadians man i have friends from canada
*  that come over here try to become citizens it's a fucking grind yeah and and and don't get me wrong
*  i love this country i've been i'm new here and i like what i see i don't like where it's going
*  in some places what don't you like uh i don't like uh the i mean i left my country because i
*  couldn't defend myself from the bad people out there the second amendment second amendment
*  yeah it's a beautiful thing you have no idea how beautiful that thing is still you don't have an
*  option to have it that's one thing uh i like the opportunities this country provides i've had a
*  lot of opportunities i would never get anywhere else i like that you can actually work and work
*  the work you put in matters here um i like uh i like how it's segmented and different you go
*  go to tennessee and you meet people out there they're great people you know there's some you
*  know people have preconceived notions of what some part of the countries are but i've loved it
*  and then you go to california and you meet people that are on the same boat as i was and they're
*  forgot completely what mexico is and they're completely americanized americanized and they're
*  completely against you as a new as a new person here really yeah so you find that like americanized
*  mexicans or or like second third generation mexicans the worst enemy of a mexican is another
*  mexican that's a classic what that's a classic uh that's a classic mexican saying and it's true
*  well that that's a classic mexican saying really most of the negativity negativity i got from being
*  on your show the first time was from latinos specifically mexican latinos what was the
*  negativity what was their criticism uh when i talked about how mexicans protested the caravans
*  going through tijuana and wrecking their city that was viewed as an extreme to the right or
*  conservative viewpoint apparently yeah but that was a fact but yeah apparently facts don't matter
*  oh that's so silly but that's people that's that's a good that's a good example of people that are not
*  there yeah they're talking about it you're not saying you didn't make a value judgment saying
*  that those people coming through were protested by mexicans need to go back to wherever fucking
*  rice patty they come from you didn't say any of that no so so this is what i saw when i when i
*  talked about it uh looks like experienced it i wasn't uh i was in tj for a while when that was
*  happening byron caravan goes through obviously a lot of those guys were gang members a lot of them
*  were not all of them a lot of them were covered in tattoos it's pretty hot outside wearing all
*  of our important hoodies cameras came by the females and the children were being put in front
*  parade in front of the media to anybody was there you could see the circus that was going on
*  and then uh a lot of the a lot of the uh camp encampments they would they would you know litter
*  the encampments with needles on the outside one of them was next to a school that had to be closed
*  down a niece of mine had a kid in there and the school had to be closed down because it was next
*  to one of these encampments they would protest and close down lanes most people that live in tj
*  uh some of them are americans and they commute so that's affecting their livelihood
*  people that work on tourism and tj livelihood went down so the fact that these people came
*  and disrupted all that whole thing and then you would see these uh californian you know hippie
*  american guys come down there and do puppet shows for these people and hand over uh donations in the
*  form of canned food blankets and stuff like that and then you would see these guys go to the back
*  door and sell all that stuff in the back and just get money for whatever they were going to use the
*  money for we would laugh at it but it also you know it's pretty disheartening having that point
*  of view online because i started posting some of the stuff online for people this is what's happening
*  and that was like no no no you're going against the uh the narrative yeah the narrative and the
*  and the people that are talking about you going against the narrative have really no idea they
*  don't care about the truth that's what's crazy the absolute is uh thing so if you're against
*  this caravan going through tijuana and affecting your you're probably a trump supporter that's
*  that's and i'm like so simple i can't even vote up here yet you don't have to be a full citizen
*  to vote so that it doesn't even factor in oh god damn it's so crazy what else about america bothers you
*  uh i think uh you know there's there's definitely this tendency in america that i see
*  the youth in america like i like um i have i have a weird mental comparison of seeing my nephews
*  down there playing soccer um going out and getting into trouble uh going to cock fights
*  which is probably pretty dangerous but they go to cock fight stuff like that and i see kids up here
*  on their tablet you know playing games playing video games getting offended by something you know
*  down there you can still punch somebody in the face if they get into your face in school
*  up you're allowed to do that in school i mean there's there's you're going to be some issues
*  but it's fine you know there's there's still that you know up here it's gone all that's gone
*  you're going to get into some issues probably going to get out of school or something you know
*  you see this weird the pacification of american children say spaces yeah don't say that that's
*  politically incorrect pacification i don't know what's a good word for it what's the play come
*  up with a politically correct word for that that has just as much kick and i'll use that i don't
*  know they can't it doesn't exist it it's the pacification yeah i mean and and
*  when i came up here the like the first year i was up here uh i saw the california gun laws change
*  like i got to see the weird california compliant rifles come to the range and you have to push a
*  button to release the magazine yeah and make it more difficult to reload yeah so strange well i
*  mean if if if if uh i've never seen a california compliant gun in the hands of a criminal myself
*  right so why why are the good like the good citizens following the law yeah the idea that
*  you're just going to handicap law-abiding citizens citizens and that's going to somehow or another
*  save lives in mass shootings and here's the other thing about you and i'm waiting for this to happen
*  but it's just not happening they're never addressing people using psychotropic drugs
*  they're not they don't address that all those school shooters all those mass shooters are all
*  on drugs yeah they're all on some kind of psych drugs and there's there's no mention of it
*  whatsoever like what what is the action of these things it's all about the guns yeah and the guns
*  are a huge issue i mean the fact that these people who are fucked up and yeah that they have access
*  and they can get access to these guns and they can wind up shooting people yes that is one issue
*  security is another issue there's another issue and that's mental health and that's that to me
*  is the biggest one because without the mental health issue you don't get mass shooters and
*  that's a interesting thing we when i get people in conversations about the violence in mexico
*  and perspective mexico cartel guys you know go into a town shoot up a bunch of people and it's
*  pretty horrible but on the mexican side we only had one school shooting that like a notable one
*  right and it was mentally ill kid when yeah took a gun to school right and as mexicans we look at
*  what happens in the u.s in schools and we're horrified by it that's like completely you know
*  horrific isn't that amazing it's again being on both sides i'm just trying to figure things
*  what about pharmaceuticals being prescribed to children in mexico is it similar not at all
*  i mean we're still behind in some and some instances as far as you know i didn't know
*  about ptsd so i came up here or tbi right really yeah i didn't know anything about that when did
*  you learn about tbi when i started talking about we should say what that is post-traumatic stress
*  disorder and traumatic brain injury for people like i learned about it i learned about it from
*  talking to most of my marine friends that were coming back from they're like he had like what
*  you're describing that you're feeling sounds like tbi really yeah you should get yourself checked
*  out and then you go down there and like oh your things would happen and people would get you know
*  let's just drink get a few days off take a few shots of tequila you're fine get back at it
*  well that's the old school mentality i mean that's what they had to deal with in world war two and
*  vietnam and yeah yeah but you've got i mean when it comes to that but mental health down in mexico
*  there's like it's not it's not anywhere as far as medicating it kids being diagnosed with things
*  like autism autism is a thing that i only recently kind of heard about 15 years ago in mexico in
*  mexico and what about um anti-psychotic drugs and all these different drugs that you're seeing that
*  these a lot of these school shooters are taking in mexico it's not a thing uh you know people
*  think that it's pretty permissive in mexico they can get any drug if you pay somebody off the thing
*  is that a lot of these uh psychiatric level they're they're not they're not available down
*  there or people there you can go to then you're like what do you want no this is not available
*  here so it's not a part of the culture it's not america no no yeah in america it's such a huge
*  part of the culture that people want that people are constantly wanting to take something to take
*  the edge off or take something so they could feel better or take something to you know to
*  just to alter their state and the doctor will prescribe it to them and then the pharmaceutical
*  drug companies are just raking in the cash from it so it just becomes a part of reality yeah there
*  was a few people like way back when i first started you know things were pretty lax when i got in
*  uh you know they you would get you know urine tested for cocaine and whatever but um some people
*  would go to oaxaca and go on mushroom trips like some of the veteran guys that would go through
*  whatever there's a there's a place in oaxaca and veracruz where they go up into the hills and
*  get some of those they call them veladas which is like uh basically going to midnight and they
*  would smoke these mushrooms and take them and they would come back apparently fix some of them that
*  was like the story you know uh it was pretty good for them to work their things out well john
*  hopkins is they're doing studies on on psilocybin and there's been studies done in psilocybin with
*  troops with ptsd and that they they've found that that it does help them mdma is another one that
*  maps is doing all these studies with mdma and uh troops coming back with ptsd yeah um i mean a lot
*  of that stuff has been around for a long time down there like uh like uh remember the beetles and
*  members of the doors went down there to yeah maria savina uh and they found out about it was a life
*  magazine article from the 1950s that was one of the first really mainstream james see if you can
*  find who wrote that there's a life article in the 50s i'm trying to remember the the guy's name
*  wasserman wasserman i feel like it's wasserman who was one of the very first guys to sort of
*  mainstream psilocybin mushrooms and it was because of uh mexican tribal cultures maria savina was
*  like the the figurehead of that movement uh she was a lady that would do these mushroom trips
*  for people that would come up in the hillside whether she would take her was it gordon wassen
*  ah it was close i knew it was something like that gordon wassen that's right yeah so this was seeking
*  the magic mushroom and i believe this was uh what year was this jamie didn't have the actual i think
*  it's in the 50s so yeah i typed in 1950 57 so maria okay maria savina left a whole legacy of that
*  in mexico and she had a lot of people that learned from her and a lot of these people are all over
*  mexico doing you know healing and spiritual work well that's the other thing about mexico mexico
*  has some uh you have some freedom like my friend ed ed clay he had a uh ibogaine uh retreat down
*  there where people would go to get off of pills yeah because it's one of the iboga is one of the
*  best ways to get off of uh particularly uh opiates yeah um there's you know there's there's
*  enforcement is hard in a country like mexico so you're not going to have people trying to go
*  inspect things and right these parts so that's why there's a lot of places like that you still
*  to this day you can go to places like jaca where technically that's taking mushrooms is illegal but
*  they grow on the hillsides didn't they kind of like uh decriminalize a lot of different things
*  down there for personal use so the quantities now matter more than they used to so sometimes
*  you would get caught with a certain quantity of something and that means you're selling it so how
*  many grams of mushrooms can you have uh i i would have i would have looked it up but everybody has
*  a different opinion on what personal use is i mean i remember the first time i saw like a box a box
*  of them and i'm like what the hell are these and you know later on i figured out what they were
*  and you know they're a thing they're a thing in mexico there's they're a big thing in mexico
*  there's a lot of people grown they're a big thing to anyone who finds out about them
*  once you eat them they become a big thing yeah yeah apparently they use them in rituals and
*  all sorts of weird rituals down there uh as a as a doorway type uh element like there's a
*  there's a ritual where they do where they bury you alive in a shallow grave oh jesus yeah it's
*  pretty it's basically a an isolation chamber a really poor man's isolation chamber uh they bury
*  you alive in the shallow grave with a rope with a bell on it and they give you a bunch of mushrooms
*  so you can think about things in there and if you freak out you ring that bell and they dig you out
*  yeah oh god yeah how you breathing down there they got a tube or something that's a shallow grave
*  it's just basically you know about that much dirt there's a hole where the rub goes through your so
*  you're kind of fine um but it's a it's like part of the death call down there they do that to kind
*  of initiate people into it but it's it's mushrooms they take mushrooms there's a bunch of weird stuff
*  that goes down down there as far as the the use of psychotropics like mushrooms and other things to
*  put people in the in that mindset of you know accepting a very specific deity or truth down
*  there yeah so let's get back to what's fucked up about america i always like talking to people
*  that are that have come here from somewhere else and just sort of look at it with a fresh eye
*  because obviously i've been here my whole life i'm used to it yeah and i'm third generation oh you
*  are yeah okay so i'm my parents were second generation my grandparents came over here
*  so it's all i'm ingrained you know i'm in the system i don't know i'm blind what else is
*  fucked up about this place uh i i mean um i don't know i mean i when i travel around i get to see
*  different parts of america and all of them you know there's there's certain certain places i've
*  been called ah you're you're you're one of the good mexicans that you know you're one of the good
*  ones i won't say what those parts of the country are but i've gotten some of that you know well
*  the united states is almost like europe where like there's all these different countries except they
*  all speak the same language yeah you know like europe has france and then they have germany and
*  you go over there there's this one then there's sweden and then it's all in this fucking big land
*  mass yeah but the united states's land mass is contiguous and they all speak the same language
*  but you want to tell me that montana is the same as florida you're out of your fucking mind well
*  um i i take those comments in stride you know uh but you're one of the good mexicans i mean being
*  kind of racial like that and just messing with each other is the thing mexicans do that all the
*  time right uh so i take it in stride it's fascinating to me that people are second
*  generation mexicans up here take more offense to something like that uh then then i would somebody
*  say you're one of the good mexicans yeah yeah whatever you know it's it's to me it's like a
*  thing i i take in well the easier things get the more people get quickly offended yeah yeah that's
*  that's a fact yeah hard times produce uh hard men hard men produce soft time soft times produce
*  weak men yeah so when i when i come up here i see some you know softness in a lot of the society
*  and a lot of feelings get hurt having to watch what i say as far as you know i was talking around
*  yeah i always tell this to people first off i'm from mexico i come from a mexican education system
*  it's a third world country so please take everything i say with that in mind right and then
*  i go into whatever i'm going to say and like when you do like when you teach classes when i have a
*  class where i have a like i recently did a conference with a bunch of uh bodyguards and
*  security professionals that work internationally i had to start with that one just to not offend
*  anybody you know that's hilarious you're teaching security guards and bodyguards and you have to
*  worry about being offended every now and then you get somebody you know what you said something oh
*  christ you fucking babies yeah so never read the comment section never uh never stay behind and
*  talk to people especially if they they look like they're they want to speak to the manager you
*  know oh did you get that when you teach classes every now and then i guess what do they say to
*  you uh you know i think i think your point of view is is is skewed because you work for the
*  government down there and you weren't part of the like the poor class i was like i wasn't part of
*  the poor class if you work for like where i work from we're pretty poor pretty poor poor right it's
*  not like you know i was middle class i was pretty poor uh or or they or they try to tell me the
*  realities of where i'm from oh that must be hilarious oh that's pretty good that's pretty
*  good ed you're just fear-mongering about mexico i go down to uh rosarito all the time with my
*  family it's fine while rosarito's fine go down to tamalipas where this shooting happened and tell
*  me the same thing you know it's perspective they really say that to you i i can't imagine
*  someone talking particularly talking to someone like you yeah who's got like real world experience
*  there's there's people out there that kind of i i believe you yeah i mean i do believe people are
*  so fucking dumb i do believe you yeah comment section yeah oh don't don't go in there man
*  but it is really true that it's the the people that live the softest easiest lives that are most
*  offended and the people that have experienced like real hardship and seen real violence that are
*  a little more hesitant to comment on things like that yeah that's that is possible yeah that is
*  real yeah and and that's one of the things that i really think is good about your page and it really
*  makes me angry that instagram censors it is that you're giving real world perspective you're
*  showing real video of a lot of this stuff and you put it up with with also your educated experience
*  on what these people are actually involved in yeah and and it's i'm not involved in any news agency
*  and a lot of this like most of those videos came in through direct messenger to my phone from people
*  that are out there hey this is happening here like okay hmm yeah you talk about it okay i'll talk
*  about it um like when the mormon thing happened uh the people the people that reached out to me
*  to talk about it were part of the family and was pretty surreal and it wasn't national news when i
*  posted it up right so some of the first like social media post about it that i could kind of
*  i was trying to look for it and it was wasn't anywhere so i talked about it and like that
*  that evening it went national news and but most of it is directly from having connections and
*  people out there that still talk to me so i always keep my ear open to that type of stuff
*  specifically from that region because that's that's my thing that's where i came from
*  well there's not a lot of mainstream news that's dedicated to this crisis dedicated to what's going
*  on it just it takes a big event like that to sort of break through all the noise and become a signal
*  that reaches us over here yeah yeah and it's you know again and things happen somewhere else and
*  all the attention and most people aren't focused on iran now so yeah the whole what happened down
*  there they're yeah it's just fucking crazy okay there's a giant problem right next door you could
*  walk to it literally i mean if you live in san diego it's a 15 minute drive yeah like it's right
*  there well it's just to me it's i love san diego and i love going down there but every time i go
*  down there i'm like you guys could walk to mexico like this is so crazy like especially la jolla
*  la jolla which is one of the most richest parts of the country fucking unbelievably beautiful
*  stunning views gorgeous mansions everybody's driving a mercedes you're 15 minutes away from
*  tijuana yeah and if we have heavy rains in tijuana all of our sewage is going to go right through
*  there really yeah is that what happens a lot of the suit like recently we have a little major
*  major rain in tijuana all the sewage goes across the border to the to a tijuana estuary there's a
*  processing facility the u.s has on this side but it can't manage all that and they have to close
*  all the beaches in the area oh wow which is again it's fascinating how to see how the effect
*  there's a there's a border wall there but it really isn't a border wall you're getting a boat you row
*  over there it takes three minutes or you can parkour okay i recently posted up a bunch of
*  videos of people parkouring over that wall i saw it yeah look i admire ingenuity i admire people
*  that find solutions to problems watching that guy scale that goddamn wall like batman yeah it's
*  amazing yeah they're they're coming up with a weird way it's like i saw some people using powdered
*  titanium to to melt the bars on on on one of the slats powdered titanium again i had to research
*  it basically it's a powder titanium burns at a very high rate and when you start it it's kind
*  of hard to put it out so they make this hole on this wall with powder some sort of powder titanium
*  mix that's like that shit what was that shit that they were talking about with 9 11 where all the
*  conspiracy theorists thought that it melted steel god damn it pyrene or something pirate is that a
*  tanner something like that right yeah that's the one yeah that's i feel like that's the stuff that
*  you blow shit up with right now they sell these things they call breach pens like and they there's
*  there's the for tactical applications there's these pens that be sticks that you start and you
*  can burn chains open and stuff like that with them really yeah so it's basically a ghetto version
*  of that is what they're using you know in some of these places i know they i mean the the wall as
*  they're making it and speaking to some of the border patrol agents that i that i know it does
*  a job as far as slowing people down so they so there's not an overflow of people coming yeah it's
*  not like yeah what would happen if it was that that's on my bonsai yeah what would happen if
*  everybody if there was no border everybody's like mexico's united states united states is mexico
*  have a good time yeah that would be chaotic of course for how long though ten years i don't know
*  how long i mean once everybody got in yeah that would be bad other people would go there yeah i
*  mean if what if united states of mexico came to a deal and they said listen yeah we'll call wasn't
*  there a thing that they were going to do there was a north american agreement there was like they were
*  trying to do that with the united states and set up a single currency yes yes a lot of conspiracy
*  theories around the amaro yes there was something like that like they were going to do it with
*  canada we're all going to become one nation i could see it with canada yeah but maybe not
*  you know mexico well look we could all spread all the good around yeah and then also like look
*  mexico's got some awesome spots wouldn't be great if u.s industry moved in there and lithium yes
*  maybe that's gonna help lithium well columbia did a great job in eradicating all the the problems
*  with narcotics i think it is well not all of them because it's still how gorilla gorilla group down
*  there that recently kind of the fark that would went uh amnesty and then they got active again
*  but there's still there's still a lot of cocaine being produced there oh yeah yeah but it's not
*  nothing like when asked no no what did they do well they were facing just a few criminal groups
*  large ones and mexico is facing a lot of them that's interesting they have the u.s right next
*  door there's pumping uh money into the uh issue directly don't have to fly in no yeah it's not a
*  long plane flight it's a short walk also mexico is a pretty big country i think people kind of
*  miss that also it's a pretty big country it's pretty big country do you do you remember when
*  there was a cia drug plane that had like several tons of cocaine on it and it crashed because the
*  mexican government wouldn't let them land and refuel yeah yeah i mean all sorts of conspiracy
*  theories are well that was a real cia drug plane that had been to guantanamo bay at least twice
*  yeah like it was documented yeah and they for whatever reason i mean i i'm flying back with a
*  lot of coke look at that look at all that coke i imagine i imagine government groups everywhere
*  have agents yeah yeah you have cowboys when people try to say the cia brings in drugs no no
*  people who work for the cia realize they can make a shitload of money if they bring in drugs and
*  they they pass that money around and they work it out but the cia itself does not bring in drugs
*  yeah uh uh customs customs and border protection agent agents and just homeland security as an
*  agency has the most corruption charges as far as all law enforcement agencies do they really
*  yeah federal federal charges for corruption uh because they are on the border and a lot of
*  money on the world of course that's that's why right it totally makes sense and uh you know i
*  mean it maybe was the cia guy that said you know can make some money through here well i mean that
*  was the whole barry seals thing that tom cruise movie made was it called made in america i think
*  yeah made in america that was about bringing in drugs with the with cowboys that work for the cia
*  yeah i mean when i was working down there in mexico and i got to see different agencies that we would
*  work with all of a sudden we're like hey uh can you guys just uh go like look over there or just
*  over there like what's going on and you would see like some sort of
*  um
*  okay let's go like you didn't know what's going on you know but plain lands plane takes off
*  plane lands nobody saw nothing nobody saw nothing you know money exchanges and just you know that's
*  in europe just an agent you know just in the background well that's the thing that's so scary
*  about what's going on with the cartels is that the quantity of money is so extraordinary now
*  it's almost like they can do anything yeah i mean uh they have their own cell phone networks in some
*  places what yeah what's it called that'd be good if i knew but they're kind of coverage they have
*  they got a pretty good pretty good coverage in their areas i mean they they dismantled some cell
*  phone networks uh in the past also like uh whole cities with uh hidden cameras that are cartel
*  controlled to see what goes in and out of the of the towns wow like so it's sophisticated oh yeah
*  so mexicans mexican government is working with uniformed uh agents patrolling and pickup trucks
*  in the back and these guys are living in 2025 and using drones to to to surveil the the patrols in
*  the area and they're using their own cell phone network so they don't have to be worried about
*  government tapping into their communications uh they're utilizing encrypted phone technology
*  that is available now commercially throughout the world um to get around some of these things
*  um and and they're and they're working they're constantly involving in how they work you know
*  i remember the first time i was working in in baha and all the cartel guys would
*  we move around in suburbans dressed like federal agents and they would look exactly like the legit
*  federal agents or they were federal agents with the cartel guys so you would oh my god so they'd
*  be together yeah and then we started working with the military and the military didn't give a
*  shit who you were they would stop everybody shoot everybody and the guys immediately saying
*  oh now we're using taxi cabs to move around and different types of cars and we're gonna paint the
*  the vans like uh taxi vans or we're gonna move around in ambulances so they changed their tactics
*  so we were always after these convoys of suburbans and now they're doing something else so that's how
*  they evolve they just you know you're trying to go after it with a hammer and these guys are
*  mosquitoes does it make you want to move to canada no no not at all that's the furthest you can get
*  away from all the chaos you know it must be going on up there as well right they may also have a
*  so uh i interviewed a uh a smuggler a coyote uh for one of the articles i wrote and um he um
*  you know asked them directly like what do you think about the the border wall and the immigration
*  uh uh policies of this current administration it's good for business you know it makes it seem
*  like it's harder to put people in in the united states so i mean that wall is pretty hard like
*  how do you do it i fly them to canada and they walk down well we talked about it before that the
*  border the united states is a wall to mexico the border from the united states to canada
*  is a giant clearing that's a hundred yards wide it's real clear you can see it like it's almost
*  like they make it easy hey just go right here yeah i mean a lot of people that want to get into us
*  you hear you hear numbers from eight thousand dollars to fifteen thousand dollars depending
*  on who you are what you're trying to do how you're trying to get up here as far as being
*  smuggled up and he's like uh pass mexican passport get a mexican passport if you're mexican
*  we'll get you a mexican passport uh we'll put two thousand dollars in an account somewhere so if
*  they want to verify if you're financially solvent they will check that and just fly to canada and
*  just walk down and that's what we do well canada is super liberal now too with justin trudeau guys
*  super liberal yeah so a lot of a lot of their a lot of their business as far as smuggling people
*  that's how they do it right now instead of going through the desert you know there is that there
*  is a lot of that going on now too like some there's a lot of people from african migrants coming into
*  into mexico people in the middle east as well which is worrying for some people coming in
*  through mexico trying to make their way up uh but it's pretty hard for these people now because
*  there's a lot of security now on both sides of the border mexican and on this side of the border
*  things are kind of more stringent a lot of the people that claim asylum like a lot of these
*  mighty caravan members come into the u.s claim asylum and say okay there's your number to wait
*  but you're going to wait in mexico so they get sent back even if they're not from mexico they
*  have to wait in mexico really interesting yeah there's a lot of these uh immigrant waiting
*  encampments in places like texas and even in tijuana there's places where people get cross
*  asylum okay here's your number you have to wait in mexico they get sent back yeah
*  man are you hopeful do you think this is going to work out okay
*  when you mean this okay like even this is what we're all talking about yeah is this going to
*  become better a better situation in the future or is it going to get more and more crazy is the
*  united states going to become like mexico i think on a global scale we're going to need each other
*  before you know before too long you know you guys are going to need mexico and mexico is going to
*  need you there's going to be some sort of situation we're going to have to come together probably you
*  mean like a global war i don't know could be oh jesus ed i mean there's a lot i mean why are you
*  freaking me out there's a lot of chinese influences in industry in mexico yes as soon as trump said
*  we're gonna when when trump was going into into office he said we're gonna bring jobs back you
*  know this whole thing so a lot of factories american factories and businesses moved out of
*  mexico and then the chinese moved in instantly well that's what's dumb about short-sightedness
*  right yeah well not understanding four d three-dimensional chess you know there's a
*  lot of moving pieces yeah and and and you know people can say whatever they want about the united
*  states uh american companies in mexico are pretty good companies and they're pretty good with their
*  workers and their their ethics are pretty good a lot better than china a lot better than china
*  you know uh it's a it's a different it's a different game and you know it's it's again you
*  you see the the these influences going into mexico because they realize that mexico is a valuable
*  place for them to have influence in well especially with what you're talking about with lithium i mean
*  i mean with battery technology and green technology becoming in the forefront of american culture
*  right now i mean everybody wants electric cars all these manufacturers ford mercedes they're all
*  coming out with electric cars porsche has got an electric car now yeah i mean that's a big deal
*  yeah they need those batteries yeah that's that's the next uh you know that's the next oil grip
*  that oil type uh situation is going to be lithium and that's right next door all right so i think
*  again i think uh as a second largest consumer of american uh products in the world is mexico
*  second largest so economies are intertwined they have a lot of americans living down there
*  there's a lot of blood ties to and within the country of course americans don't want america
*  to be mexico and uh of course a lot of mexicans want mexico to be more like america that's what
*  would fix things increasing the opportunities and making mexico a better place yeah we need
*  to make some make mexico great again shirts and yeah and get getting fights at the airport
*  uh i mean really if we're connected to mexico if mexico was like canada where you know like
*  canada is fucking wonderful you go over there there's amazing cities it's it's great it's safe
*  it's clean if we can make mexico like that then we'd have you know it would be better for everybody
*  including mexico including the united states everybody post 9 11 um at the border you could
*  see how businesses started failing in san diego because it became harder to cross the border
*  so you're interested there's there's symbiotic relationship with some of these border towns
*  specifically california is very dependent on some border towns in mexico yeah you ever see that
*  documentary a day without mexicans yeah just shut this whole fucking place down man there's nothing
*  going on without mexicans here yeah that's why anti-mexican racism is some of the dumbest racism
*  in all of the united states but particularly for california it's so stupid um i uh you know i got
*  to see how like in places like uh fallbrook california where the the avocado capital of the
*  world cutting down all the avocado trees because there's a drought and there's nobody to pick them
*  really yeah there's less no one to pick because less people coming up and it's harder to maintain
*  like you know people they hire illegals and there's holy shit these farms need to organize
*  start working on border control it's like the whole i don't know man i i'm i'm one of those people that
*  believes in borders but i also believe if you're a hard-working person who wants to do better you
*  should have an opportunity and i and i don't think a lot of people particularly poor people that aren't
*  very well educated there's not an opportunity they can't there's no reason for them to be over
*  here so if they applied for united states citizenship well there's well why you want to come
*  here well i want to come here for opportunity well what do you have to offer i'm you know i'm a hard
*  worker well there's a lot of hard workers i mean that's really the attitude yeah you know and i
*  think we all just got i mean me i got lucky i got lucky my grandparents came here that got lucky
*  that's all it is it's just luck and to deny that and to deny these other people this opportunity
*  there's just got to be a way to filter out bad people yeah maybe as technology gets better and
*  we can recognize bad people better yeah i mean i went through a bunch of questioning
*  look at my background i got a lot of questions from what i used to do right i got a looks and
*  it's fine you know and i you know i was like i didn't you know i didn't do anything wrong so
*  like i'm here it's fine but uh you know there's a lot of people like again the luna garcia luna was
*  here on a green card and he got uh nabbed when he went to process his full citizenship so he was
*  here for a long time wow he should have just stuck with the green card i would have kept quiet probably
*  that's why he's in jail right he lied to a to an immigration agent that's one of the charges he
*  has on oh wow right so it's pretty interesting that people like him have spent a long time up
*  things like open secrets and you know uh yeah i mean again not all not all mexicans are good guys
*  you know not all humans are good yeah i know yeah so you know hard-working people come up here
*  i got some of the people that that i've met out here that are kind of on the same boat as i am
*  fresh in the country you know doing manual labor construction uh working at kentucky i i met a
*  bunch of guys that were working on the kentucky derby or the horse stalls around them all mexicans
*  you can smell you know the tortillas the good food is usually you can smell you know you can you know
*  where they are dude there's a place if you're hungry there's a place i don't tell anybody the
*  name because i don't want to fuck it up okay there's a place down the street from here that like
*  every time you go in there mexican soap operas playing nobody speaks english the food's off the
*  charts that's how i know lengua tacos oh yeah lengua quesadillas yeah make organ meat great
*  again yes that's another thing i'm talking about yeah organ more organ meat don't throw away the
*  tongue no don't throw away the tongue the tripe yeah tripe yeah dude i love liver i eat heart and
*  liver that's another thing weird thing i see all the stuff you throw away from the i know
*  they've never had menudo oh that's that's sad this place up here has menudo oh it's off the
*  charts uh the best hangover food um and the new the new dough right why how does that work
*  there's like a science behind that uh you know organ meat i don't know there's a lot of nutrients
*  in it basically a lot of nutrients get stored in organ and it's a soup so you get the rehydration
*  from that yeah and it's all it's like a common thing in mexico about liver specifically i grew
*  up on a on a pig on a pig farm and my mom would have this rule if you killed it you have to eat it
*  so i killed the rattlesnake once and i was peeling it and the liver over the rattlesnake
*  was like a treat that she would give us right really yeah raw raw whoo yeah it's pretty good
*  core well my mom was pretty hardcore my god sounds so yeah but listen man thanks for coming here and
*  dropping knowledge we really appreciate you and uh again ed manifesto is your instagram page uh
