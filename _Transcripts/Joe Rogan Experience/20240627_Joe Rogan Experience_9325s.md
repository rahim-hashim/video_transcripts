# Joe Rogan Experience #2170 - Max Lugavere
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tnCsKVltdE)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day.
*  What's up, Max?
*  How are you?
*  Good to see you.
*  So good to see you.
*  I know.
*  What's cracking?
*  Oh man, just first of all, honor to be here.
*  Thank you.
*  Love you and your work.
*  And yeah, I mean, just a national treasure.
*  That's very nice of you.
*  Go out on a limb and say it.
*  No, I'm super, super excited because I've been working on this documentary for the last
*  10 years of my life and it's finally out today, which I'm super pumped for.
*  It's called Little Empty Boxes.
*  And we talked about it the last time I was here.
*  And it's a project that means the world to me.
*  I think it's the most important thing I've ever done.
*  And it's the first ever dementia prevention documentary about the science of dementia
*  prevention.
*  It's a very emotional and personal film for me because it follows my mom, who for many
*  years suffered from a rare form of dementia called Lewy body dementia, which is akin
*  to having both Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease at the same time.
*  That's what Robin Williams had.
*  That's what Robin Williams had, yeah.
*  And it's a rare condition.
*  It affects about one million people in the United States, but it's a dementia.
*  And dementia is now a soaring public health problem.
*  And there's a lot of controversy within the field.
*  The last time I was here, we talked about fraud in the research space with regard to
*  the prevailing hypothesis as to what causes Alzheimer's disease, which is the most common
*  form of dementia.
*  And actually, finally, over the past month, that paper was finally retracted.
*  It took two years.
*  Could you explain to everybody what the fraud was?
*  Yeah.
*  So basically, among the dementias, Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of it.
*  And that affects about six million people in the United States.
*  And since it was first named in 1906 by physician Alois Alzheimer, the prevailing hypothesis
*  as to what causes Alzheimer's disease, dubbed the amyloid hypothesis, has been that this
*  plaque formed by a precursor protein called amyloid beta accumulates in the brain.
*  And by finding a drug that can potentially remove, extract those plaques from the brain,
*  from the extracellular space around neurons, that we could essentially cure the disease,
*  that the causal factor in the condition was ultimately this amyloid beta protein, which
*  forms the plaque.
*  And trial after trial had been a dismal failure.
*  And it wasn't looking good until in 2006, a paper was published in Nature, which for
*  any scientist publishing in Nature, it's like winning an Academy Award.
*  And that paper, essentially, what that did was it allegedly identified this variant of
*  amyloid beta that connected the plaque to the cognitive dysfunction.
*  So the most important clinical feature of Alzheimer's disease, because for a long time,
*  it was known that cognitively healthy people accumulate plaque in their brains.
*  And that plaque doesn't seem to correlate with cognitive impairment or anything like
*  that.
*  And so that was very deflating for researchers in the field until this 2006 paper came out.
*  And what it did was it renewed faith in this hypothesis, which was always a hypothesis,
*  and continued to send billions and billions of dollars worth of funding down this path.
*  And what turned out to be the case just two years ago was that that paper was essentially
*  fraudulent.
*  And it represented about 16 years worth of wasted time, wasted money, which was hugely
*  deflating for not just the research community, but also for any patient who's ever suffered
*  from Alzheimer's disease.
*  And the way that the field is now slowly starting to turn, but this is a drum that I've been
*  beating for the past 10 years, is that we really need to start talking about these conditions
*  in terms of prevention.
*  And that's what inspired me to set down this path of creating this documentary, Little
*  Empty Boxes.
*  What was the fraud?
*  How did they do it?
*  So basically, in the paper, they identified these proteins that they isolated in rat models
*  of the condition, mouse models of the condition, called A beta star 56.
*  Again, amyloid is there at the scene of the crime, so to speak.
*  So when you have Alzheimer's disease, somebody who's died of Alzheimer's disease, what they
*  find inevitably in the brains of cadavers who've died from Alzheimer's disease are
*  two features.
*  They see this aggregation of these plaques, amyloid beta plaques, and tangled proteins
*  called tau.
*  And so it was a very seductive narrative that this plaque causes the condition for years.
*  The problem is they've succeeded at reducing the plaque in the brains of people with Alzheimer's
*  disease, but that hasn't led to any improvement in the clinically meaningful features of the
*  disease that we aspire to improve for sufferers of Alzheimer's disease, the cognitive function.
*  And in tandem with that, we see that amyloid is produced naturally in all brains, and people
*  who are cognitively healthy have amyloid in their brains.
*  There's a degree of amyloid burden that seems to be inevitable as a just general phenomena
*  due to aging.
*  And so it was becoming very clear that amyloid is not the causative feature here, that there
*  is some other factor or factors at play which lead to cognitive degeneration until 2006.
*  And in 2006 what happened, this paper basically found this subtype that when injected into
*  a mouse caused profound cognitive dysfunction.
*  And what they did was they illustrated these proteins in what's called a Western blot analysis,
*  which is basically a graphical depiction of proteins.
*  And the peer review process for papers, I mean, people go in and they crunch the numbers
*  and stuff, but they don't look at like imagery, and they don't look with a...
*  They don't go through the imagery with a fine tooth comb to make sure that it hasn't been
*  photoshopped essentially.
*  But one sleuth who is a scientist himself, this researcher from Vanderbilt named Matthew
*  Schrag actually identified that a lot of these images had artifacts that made it very clear
*  that they were faked.
*  Yeah.
*  So full on fraud.
*  Full on fraud.
*  And by the way, it's been two years.
*  It took two years for that paper finally to be retracted.
*  Are there any consequences towards people that publish that paper?
*  I mean, it's obviously they have a lot of egg on their face, so to speak.
*  It's hugely humiliating.
*  But no, I don't think that there's...
*  They're still employed?
*  They're, yeah.
*  The lead researcher still employed.
*  I mean, they're investigating Sylvain Lesney, who is a university of...
*  I want to say Michigan, not Michigan.
*  It'll come to me.
*  But the primary researcher is being investigated as far as I know.
*  So the primary researcher, they're connecting to the Photoshop?
*  Yeah.
*  They're saying this person might have been the one that released it?
*  Yeah.
*  It was very clear.
*  It was very clear.
*  And that...
*  God, it's so dirty.
*  It's so dirty.
*  It's so evil for all the people that are looking for some sort of relief.
*  Yeah.
*  You have this scientific paper you published, and you knowingly release these Photoshopped
*  images in order to validate your paper?
*  There's a ton of fraud and...
*  God.
*  Yeah.
*  It's so evil when you think about how many people suffer from this.
*  So many people.
*  And you're giving them this false hope just to boost up your academic career.
*  Yeah.
*  It's awful, the lost time.
*  And by the way, that paper has been subsequently referenced thousands of times in the medical
*  literature, basically negating a ton of research.
*  Countless papers that have been since published that have referenced that paper in 2006, that
*  Nature paper that was finally retracted.
*  Think about the lost time.
*  Think about the needless suffering.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's my view that dementia...
*  Essentially by the time you are diagnosed with dementia, we'll say Alzheimer's disease,
*  you are in late stage Alzheimer's disease.
*  Whether it's mild, whether you were just diagnosed yesterday, this is a disease of midlife with
*  symptoms that appear in late life.
*  And so that's why the field is now slowly, hopefully, I hope, pivoting more towards prevention.
*  And where the money I think needs to go is into identifying that golden biomarker that's
*  associated with the onset of the condition so that clinicians can intervene earlier.
*  Because right now when you catch it, it's sort of like pancreatic cancer, which incidentally
*  my mom passed from in 2018.
*  But it's pancreatic cancer, most of the time it's diagnosed and it's too late.
*  The tumor is already metastasized.
*  And so this is kind of similar with Alzheimer's disease.
*  By the time it's diagnosed, you're already very late in the game.
*  There's widespread neuronal dysfunction, glucose metabolism in the brain is diminished by 50%.
*  So again, you're catching it in its latest stages, ultimately.
*  And that's why I think Alzheimer's drug trials have a 99.6% fail rate.
*  Because by the time you catch it, I think reversing it is impossible.
*  I think it can be slowed with exercise, with a multimodal dietary and lifestyle intervention.
*  But yeah, it's really sad.
*  And so that's why 10 years ago when I saw this developing in my mom and I stumbled upon
*  all this research and I began really diving in, it became very clear to me that this is
*  something that anybody with a brain needs to be aware of and talking about.
*  And what's the factors when it comes to someone eventually getting Alzheimer's?
*  Is it purely genetic?
*  Is it lifestyle?
*  Is it diet?
*  Are there environmental factors and toxins?
*  What is it?
*  Yeah, so there are what are called risk factors.
*  So the heritability of Alzheimer's disease is very low.
*  It's like 2% to 3%.
*  And the variant that is hereditary is early onset familial.
*  So that makes up a very tiny proportion of overall Alzheimer's incidence.
*  And similarly with Parkinson's disease, the heritability of Parkinson's disease is very
*  low.
*  I mean, and I definitely want to talk about Parkinson's disease because there's a lot
*  of really interesting new research in that field.
*  But by and large, with regard to Alzheimer's disease, you have what are called your non-modifiable
*  risk factors, which are your age.
*  You can't change your age, your gender, you can't change your gender, and your genes.
*  You can't change your genes, although you can affect how your genes express themselves,
*  which is known as epigenetics.
*  But then you have your modifiable risk factors, which I think is so exciting because these
*  are the risk factors that you have agency over.
*  You can control obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes.
*  I mean, these are all nutritionally mediated, obviously, which I love talking about nutrition
*  and nutrition insofar as it can prevent or reverse obesity.
*  I think that's incredibly empowering.
*  Type 2 diabetes, if you have type 2 diabetes, your risk for developing Alzheimer's disease
*  increases between two and fourfold.
*  They're actually now, we interviewed in my documentary, the researcher who coined the
*  term type 3 diabetes.
*  Have you heard that?
*  Are you familiar with that concept?
*  No, I haven't.
*  So it's looking a lot like Alzheimer's disease might, in fact, be a form of diabetes of the
*  brain, which is a mind blowing way to think about this condition.
*  And in fact, we see that peripheral insulin resistance, so the hallmark of type 2 diabetes
*  is insulin resistance.
*  And we see that the more insulin resistant a person is, the more difficulty their brains
*  seem to have with regard to creating ATP, which is the primary energy currency of ourselves.
*  And the researcher who coined type 3 diabetes, her name is Suzanne de la Monte.
*  She's a Brown University researcher and she is in no way in the public sphere.
*  She's a purely a bench researcher.
*  She's actually in my documentary.
*  It was incredible to get to interview her and speak to her.
*  But it seems that insulin resistance causes the brain to suffer in many ways.
*  It damages the blood vessels.
*  Ultimately, when you have type 2 diabetes, it damages the blood vessels that supply the
*  brain with oxygen, nutrients, energy.
*  But it also seems to impair, there also seems to be an aspect of insulin resistance that
*  reduces the brain's ability to generate energy.
*  Okay.
*  So when you first started becoming aware of this, your mother develops this condition,
*  you first start being aware of it.
*  What were the first things that you noticed that started to get you to question whether
*  or not the conventional applications of drugs are on the right path?
*  Yeah, I mean, you know, I grew up in New York City and when my mom first started to show
*  these symptoms.
*  And how did you notice it?
*  Like what were the symptoms?
*  She would, I mean, we would have, I was living in LA at the time and so we would touch base
*  every other day via phone and she started to complain to me about brain fog.
*  And there was some aspect of what she was sharing with me that I thought was just a
*  natural part of getting older.
*  But ultimately, she revealed to me and the rest of my family that she had sought the
*  help of a neurologist.
*  And that seemed odd, you know, why would my mom, I hadn't had any prior family incidents
*  of dementia, anything like that.
*  Why was my mom suddenly going to see a neurologist?
*  And but you know, like I was still in LA living my life, I was in my late 20s at the time.
*  But it wasn't until a trip to Miami, my family went down to Miami to hang out with my dad,
*  because my parents had been separated and my mom was in the kitchen.
*  And she confessed to the family that she'd been having memory problems at this point.
*  So it had been described as brain fog, but she revealed that she had sought the help
*  of a neurologist.
*  And you know, me and my and my brothers and my dad, we were in total disbelief that my
*  mom was having anything outside of the could possibly be having anything outside of the
*  realm of ordinary.
*  And so we were kind of mocking her in a way.
*  And we said, Well, if you're really having such such profound problems, what month is
*  it?
*  Or I think it was like, what year is it or something like that?
*  And she couldn't recall, she couldn't recall what the month was.
*  And she started to cry.
*  And at that point, for me, that's when I knew that something was really wrong, that I needed
*  to step in.
*  Because, you know, when you're sick, it is a really that's a really scary place to be.
*  It could be frustrating.
*  It could be confusing.
*  And you know, when you're in these doctors offices and they're, you know, oftentimes
*  they don't have the best bedside manner and they run a battery of esoteric tests, it can
*  be incredibly overwhelming.
*  And it becomes really hard to advocate for yourself, I've learned as somebody with a
*  chronic illness, not least of which a chronic illness that's affecting your cognition.
*  And so I decided at that point, essentially that I had to pack up my life.
*  I moved back to New York and I started going with my mom from doctor's visit to doctor's
*  visit.
*  And again, you know, I'm pretty privileged, grew up in New York City.
*  My mom had health insurance resources.
*  We started going, you know, to all of these different cathedrals to Western medicine academic
*  medical insight.
*  And in every instance, I experienced what I've come to call over time, adios, diagnose
*  and adios.
*  A physician would, you know, run these tests, titrate up the dose of a medication that she
*  was already on.
*  One physician actually thought that all of her symptoms were due to depression.
*  Right.
*  There's this like idea of the hysterical woman today, one in four women over the age of 40
*  are on an antidepressant drug, you know, so one in four.
*  Yeah.
*  Or the age of 40.
*  Christ.
*  Yeah.
*  They're I mean, I'm not saying there's no use for them, those kinds of drugs, but they're
*  very over overprescribed.
*  That's not that's not I don't think that's controversial.
*  And so my mom was given one of these drugs without full informed consent.
*  I don't think I mean, ultimately, we tried to get her off of them, which we found out
*  was incredibly difficult to do.
*  Titrating off one of these SSRIs is really, really hard, actually.
*  And it turned out obviously to be to be the case that my mom that these symptoms were
*  not due to depression.
*  They were due to degeneration in her brain.
*  And we went from doctor's office to doctor's office, ultimately culminating in a trip to
*  the Cleveland Clinic.
*  So just imagine like we're in New York City, right?
*  We have like multiple hospitals that are at our disposal.
*  We had to book a trip to the Cleveland Clinic, and it was there that for the first time,
*  my mom was diagnosed with a neurodegenerative condition.
*  So she was prescribed drugs for both Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease at that time.
*  And that to me was I'd never I've always been a pretty chill guy, but that was the first
*  time in my life I'd ever I've ever had a panic attack.
*  Googling the drugs, you know, like a scared like any scared kid would do when their mom
*  receives a life changing diagnosis.
*  And and that was the moment for me that I realized that my life had to pivot and I I
*  had no choice but to dedicate myself to learning all that I could about these conditions.
*  And so you find out about the fraud.
*  And how long into your research did you find out that most of what people understood about
*  the condition was based on this fraudulent study?
*  Well, it's not even just the study.
*  It's the fact that these conditions begin decades before the emergence of symptoms.
*  So you know, again, it's a disease of midlife, essentially.
*  They did the Alzheimer's disease begins 20 to 30 years, if not more, before the first
*  symptom.
*  And so to me, it became very clear that we were approaching these conditions in the wrong
*  way, you know, trying to acting in a reactionary way to something that had taken decades to
*  manifest to me just seemed wrong.
*  And I stumbled upon the work of a neurologist at Wild Cornell, New York Presbyterian, who
*  was talking about Alzheimer's disease as a preventable condition, which is not something
*  that I'd heard prior to coming across his work.
*  And I realized at that time that this was like considered 10 years ago, a fringe idea.
*  Dementia prevention was like a fringe idea, except for through the lens of this neurologist
*  who was working within the confines of, you know, rigorous randomized research and, you
*  know, and checking all the boxes for scientific credibility.
*  And so to me, it became really it became really clear that this is a topic that I needed to
*  help amplify using my skill set as a non medical doctor, as a non academic scientist.
*  And I also learned really early on that it's not a genetic condition that we have genetic
*  risk factors, but that that we have a say when it comes to our cognitive destiny, that
*  this is not a natural part of aging.
*  I mean, you know, everything in the body as you get older tends to falter in its functionality,
*  you know, like our joints don't work as well.
*  And, you know, there is a degree of forgetfulness that I think is in a way a natural aspect
*  of getting older.
*  But cognitive impairment, that's not natural.
*  Degeneration of our of our neurons of, you know, of, for example, the portion of the
*  brain that that drives movement, the substantia nigra, which is which occurs in Parkinson's
*  disease.
*  That's not normal.
*  And so it began this investigation for me trying to understand because I was seeing
*  the person who meant the most to me of anybody in life, you know, degenerating every day
*  in front of my face, getting worse and worse and worse.
*  It instilled this this burning desire in me to understand all that I could and to share
*  to in the hopes that it might prevent it from happening to others.
*  And and yeah, it was also very odd because my my maternal grandmother did not have dementia.
*  So it was really sad and surreal, in fact, that my mom was increasingly requiring around
*  the clock care while her mother, who lived in the same home and was 30 years older, was
*  cognitively totally healthy.
*  It was just it was just the oddest thing.
*  My my my grandmother, my mom's mom, was in her 90s and totally cognitively healthy, able
*  to form cogent senses.
*  And my mom was struggling to express an idea to get out of a bathroom.
*  And it just to me, it was it was so shocking that I you know, it was it was traumatic.
*  I mean, I still have PTSD, I think, from from those days.
*  But it it's yeah, it's motivated me to to do what I can to help.
*  And I saw all in every you know, by the end of my mom's life, she was on 14 different
*  pharmaceuticals.
*  And I'm not I'm not anti-pharma.
*  Like if there was a drug that would have actually helped my mom, I would have been first in
*  line to the pharmacy to to fill that prescription for her.
*  But the drugs don't work at all.
*  And physicians are very quick to, you know, to write a prescription to like add a new
*  drug to the arsenal.
*  They're they're very reluctant to deprescribe.
*  I have never seen a prescription deprescribed to my mom.
*  And by the end of her life, she was on 14 different pharmaceuticals.
*  And there's nobody on earth that that understands how all of those different drugs are
*  interacting in a, you know, in a in a system that's going growing increasingly frail.
*  It was just really sad.
*  And, you know, so I started to investigate these modifiable risk factors, you know,
*  whether it's diet, dietary, diet related, which it you know, in my mom's case, it may
*  have had something to do with her diet over the years.
*  It might have had nothing to do with her diet over the years.
*  I'll never know.
*  But also now we're starting to see that air pollution is a major contributor to neurodegeneration.
*  We're starting to see now that, well, as of 2020, it was acknowledged that exposure to
*  air pollution is actually one of these newly identified model modifiable risk factors for
*  Alzheimer's disease.
*  So exposure to fine particulate matter, PM 2.5, actually might cause Alzheimer's disease
*  for some patients.
*  And then most interestingly, and this is one of the things that I want to talk about with
*  you, which I came across the work of a neurologist named Dr. Ray Dorsey, who's over at University
*  of Rochester, who's done a lot of work publishing on the link between environmental toxicants
*  and Parkinson's disease.
*  Parkinson's disease is now the fastest growing brain disease.
*  And my mom's condition actually had more in common with Parkinson's disease than it did
*  Alzheimer's disease.
*  She had Lewy body dementia, which is has more in common with Parkinson's, even though they're
*  both dementia, Lewy body and Alzheimer's.
*  But there's data now linking exposure to certain herbicides and pesticides to Parkinson's
*  disease, dramatically increased risk, anywhere between three, two and a half to six fold
*  increased risk.
*  Which herbicides and pesticides?
*  So there's a pesticide called Paraquat that there's a great article written in The Guardian
*  by a journalist named Carrie Gillum.
*  And I got to speak on a panel with her recently at a scientific conference in D.C. called
*  Brain and Environment.
*  And Paraquat is this compound that it's an herbicide that's produced in China, but its
*  use is banned in China.
*  We import it here.
*  Yeah.
*  It's crazy.
*  We use it here and expose occupational exposure to this compound is associated with between
*  two and a half to three times a risk for the development of Parkinson's disease.
*  Related compounds are literally used in mouse models to create Parkinson's disease.
*  And the company that has that creates it is has been under investigation for years.
*  And what has now come to light is that they knew about the fact that these chemicals accumulate
*  in the brain, in brain tissue, and they seem to selectively target the region of the brain
*  associated with Parkinson's disease, the substantia nigra.
*  Wow.
*  It's very scary.
*  And you know, what crops are these used on?
*  Is it specific crops?
*  Is specific foods to avoid?
*  Or how do you know if those pesticides or herbicides are being used?
*  Well, it's the residues and the exposures that you get from eating them is very low.
*  But we don't know what long term exposure to those low levels is doing to us.
*  I mean, my mother is somebody who never believed in organic produce, right?
*  And organic is not perfect.
*  And natural compounds, some of them are the most dangerous compounds on earth.
*  So I know, you know, some people listening might say, oh, you know, here we go with the
*  appeal to nature fallacy.
*  But it's very clear that occupational exposure is very hazardous.
*  You have to be licensed.
*  You have to use this stuff very carefully.
*  But it some people actually use it to to to off themselves.
*  I mean, it's like it's a really toxic compound.
*  And we're now we now have data suggesting that it creates this condition that it's selectively
*  targets and destroys dopamine producing neurons that that that mediate movement.
*  And and it's used.
*  Yeah, it's used in cereal grains, things like that.
*  Why does cannabis oil have a profound effect on Parkinson's patients?
*  You know, I don't I don't know about cannabis oil, but I can tell you about nicotine.
*  And nicotine is a very interesting compound from the vantage point of Parkinsonism.
*  And I know I mean, a lot of people love nicotine, obviously, for its its cognitive boosting
*  effects.
*  I'm not going to say that it's a it's a healthy compound.
*  I mean, I think that it has cardiovascular repercussions and the like.
*  But there seems to be a and of course, smoking is terrible for you.
*  But cardiovascular with the delivery method or just across the board.
*  Nicotine by itself raises heart rate and it raises blood pressure acutely.
*  Not by much, but presumably.
*  And it's vasoconstrictive as well.
*  So it you know, there's some evidence suggesting it.
*  It impedes wound healing.
*  I will occasionally use nicotine as a as a cognitive enhancer.
*  But I also have I have chronic low back issues.
*  And I think that, you know, for people with disc issues, this is just a speculation.
*  I think that it's probably not a good idea to chronically use nicotine if you have disc
*  issues, which are already your discs and your back are already poorly vascularized.
*  And nicotine is a vasoconstrictor vasoconstrictor and smoking, you know, increases your risk
*  for Alzheimer's disease.
*  I'm not I don't think that there's a that we've identified a relationship between pure
*  nicotine and well, pretty much anything.
*  The research on pure nicotine by itself is pretty sparse.
*  Most of the research on the health effects of nicotine is confounded by smoking, which
*  is obviously obviously not good for you.
*  But interestingly, there does seem to be an inverse relationship between nicotine use,
*  even via smoking and Parkinsonism.
*  So people who smoke cigarettes seem to be protected to some degree against Parkinson's
*  disease, which is very odd.
*  And they've shown in mouse models that nicotine actually, when they use some of these mitochondrial
*  toxins, some of these poisons like Paraquat, right, or another one called MPTP, which is
*  has been used as a as a street party drug, but it's actually profoundly neurotoxic.
*  It's been shown to create chronic Parkinsonism with just acute use.
*  Nicotine actually prevents that in those models.
*  So it's been shown to somehow protect the brain from in some in some regards against
*  Parkinson's disease.
*  So I wouldn't recommend using nicotine unless somebody and this is again a speculation.
*  But my my hypothesis is that if you were if you were exposed to occupationally to some
*  of these compounds like Paraquat or rhodanone or there are there are other compounds that
*  are being directly connected to Parkinson's disease to like trichloroethylene, I would
*  say maybe nicotine is a is a potentially disease modifying intervention in those contexts.
*  So in these when they've studied patients, was there a small like a noticeably smaller
*  instance of people who develop Parkinson's who are smokers or was it nonexistent?
*  Like they're they're just I'm not sure the the relative risk decrease, but it's one of
*  these odd things that seems pretty consistent in the literature that smokers are less likely
*  to develop Parkinson's disease.
*  Is that a factor?
*  I'm not sure.
*  I'm not sure the factor, but it's significant.
*  It's significant.
*  But smoke.
*  But smokers are more likely to develop a whole host of other.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  But that's the interesting thing is that nicotine.
*  It's thought that nicotine protects this one region of the brain.
*  Have they looked at people that are taking nicotine in different ways like cigars, gum
*  patches, things along those lines.
*  A lot of the a lot of the research on nicotine is in animal models, unfortunately.
*  But it is I mean, it does seem to do if you set the vascular effects aside, which might
*  play a role in neuro degeneration because, you know, the brain relies on its vascular
*  network. The brain is a very hungry organ and vascular dementia is the second most common
*  form of dementia, actually. But nicotine does seem to have some really protective effects
*  on the brain. It seems to reduce neuroinflammation.
*  It might act in a way as an antioxidant in the brain.
*  I'm not recommending it because there are risks, of course, but.
*  But they've shown that it seems to be protective in these animal models against against these
*  poisons that would otherwise cause Parkinsonism and.
*  Some other cool facts about nicotine, actually, because I did do a little bit of a deep dive
*  recently into it because because I do notice a cognitive benefit when I when I use it.
*  Nicotine, how do you use it?
*  I just use it. I use it like before.
*  But what in what form?
*  A lozenge, like a little like, you know, lozenge.
*  And and I don't have an addictive personality.
*  So for me, I'm not like, you know, it's not something that I feel compelled to do every
*  day. But I do it before.
*  Before, like I have to go on like a TV show or do a big podcast or something.
*  And and I do see, you know, I do definitely see like a cognitive
*  bit like a, you know, it's a stimulant.
*  That's that's pretty well known.
*  But. But yeah, nicotine also, it has a very short half life.
*  So it's half life is only about two hours.
*  I mean, you compare that to coffee coffees is like eight hours.
*  So it's it's relatively transient in your system.
*  But then I think the more interesting compound is is its primary metabolite, which is
*  called cotinine, which it's cotinine's half life is 20 hours long.
*  And it seems to also boost cognitive function, mental health insofar as animal
*  models can show us that these compounds boost mental health, might even enhance
*  what's called fear extinction. So for people with PTSD, it might play a role.
*  So it's a it's a really interesting compound.
*  But, you know, again, it's it's highly addictive.
*  And what is cotinine?
*  It's nicotine's primary metabolite in the body.
*  So when you ingest nicotine, nicotine lasts in the body only about the half
*  life is two hours. So it lasts presumably about four hours.
*  But it converts to this compound called called cotinine in the body.
*  And the half life of that compound is about 20 hours.
*  So it's in your system for a long time.
*  And that compound doesn't have any of the negative side effects of nicotine.
*  It just seems to do all these interesting, cool.
*  So does all the positives and none of the negatives?
*  It seems to. I mean, it's not a stimulant.
*  Short and long term effects of that's coding, bro.
*  It's cot. I was trying to spell it.
*  Different compound.
*  Yeah, that's that will fuck you up.
*  That's in cough syrup.
*  Cotinine. Yeah.
*  How do you spell it? Cot I N I N E, I believe.
*  Yeah, it's super interesting stuff.
*  And do people take this as a supplement?
*  No, but your body readily will create it from
*  I don't know if it doesn't have the
*  cotinine produced by the body after exposure to nicotine, the main metabolite of nicotine.
*  70 80 percent of nicotine is converted to cotinine.
*  Cotinine is often used as a biomarker for exposure to tobacco smoke.
*  It can be detected in urine. OK.
*  Cotinine can remain in the body a day or more.
*  Nicotine disappears in a few hours.
*  Yeah, but you can Google like cotinine, fear, extinction or cotinine cognition.
*  Really why people say that cigarettes relax them. Yeah.
*  Definitely. I mean, it's an anxiolytic.
*  It reduces anxiety. Interesting.
*  Yeah. See, I mean, it does seem to be this.
*  It's like this really interesting compound where it does all these
*  you know, it has all these effects in the body that
*  many of which I'm sure are negative, but it does seem to
*  do some good stuff for the brain, which is fascinating, you know.
*  So I think I think again, I'm not promoting it, but
*  if you're able to forge as an adult
*  responsible relationship with it, you know, then
*  maybe it's worth experimenting with if, you know, particularly because of its
*  you know, its its potential to
*  I don't want this to come off as an endorsement for nicotine, but
*  its ability potentially to protect against Parkinsonism is very is very interesting.
*  And so when a person you're saying, so this is something that starts to happen
*  in midlife and then it really expresses itself in dramatic ways years later.
*  What are other than the environmental factors?
*  What dietary factors contribute
*  in except obviously pesticides and herbicides that are
*  unfortunately a part of our food system now? Yeah.
*  I mean, here's the thing, like organic is,
*  as I mentioned, it's not a panacea and
*  today on social media, if you even if you in so much as mentioned,
*  organic and that debate organic versus conventional, I mean, there's
*  there's so much controversy. But, you know, I think
*  the as we've seen, right, with Paraquat and this Chinese company that has
*  shrouded the data. And in fact, they they've assembled internally a SWAT team
*  to basically to essentially suppress data suggesting harm due to exposure
*  to this to this herbicide, even though it's banned, even though it's banned in China.
*  Yeah. Wow. Just so they can keep selling it just so they could keep selling it.
*  But there was there was another there was another article that came out recently in
*  the publication ProPublica written by, I believe her name was Sharon Lerner,
*  another journalist who I connected with at this DC event that I was at recently,
*  who it was this crazy three M has been hiding the health harms,
*  shrouding the health, suppressing the health harms due to exposure to these PFAS
*  PFAS compounds that are forever chemicals known endocrine disruptors.
*  In band-aids. Yeah.
*  So there's there's like all this corporate collusion and shrouding of the truth.
*  And I'm just like, I think insofar as you can reduce your exposures
*  to these kinds of things and and and selectively, you know, if money is is is scarce,
*  you know, selectively by certain things organic, I think that makes sense.
*  Do they have organic band-aids?
*  That's a good question. I don't know.
*  But they recently identified these compounds. And yeah.
*  Yeah, I read the study about the band-aid thing and I was like, Jesus Christ,
*  is anything safe? It's not fucking band-aids.
*  We've all got microplastics in our balls these days.
*  Microplastics in our atheromas.
*  Like they found in our in our arteries that the presence of microplastics
*  was associated with two to three, two to three fold increased risk of cardiovascular death.
*  So here it is.
*  Partnering with Environmental Health News, a consumer watchdog sent
*  40 bandages of different brands, U.S.
*  Environmental Protection Agency certified lab.
*  The lab found that 65 percent of the bandages campaign
*  contain detectable levels of synthetic forever chemicals or PFAS. Yeah.
*  Wow. Yeah.
*  And that is so crazy because it's an open wound.
*  Yes. It's like literally mainlining right into your bloodstream.
*  It's nuts.
*  And you talk about this stuff today on social media and you're accused
*  of fear mongering of being alarmist. You're not.
*  It's yeah. What is that, though?
*  Is that trolls from pharmaceutical companies?
*  I mean, they're there.
*  That's something that I guarantee you corporations use.
*  If if nations use it and we know they do, we know we do.
*  We know that there's troll farms in Russia.
*  We know this is a real thing.
*  Why wouldn't corporations use that, too, especially if they could farm that off
*  and be removed from it as far as like being able to trace back the paperwork?
*  I mean, we see it all.
*  I mean, even within our own, you know, within our own government, the USDA,
*  the dietary guidelines for Americans, 95 percent of people on that committee
*  have had have or have had conflicts of interest with the pharmaceutical industry
*  and the food industry. Yeah.
*  At least 50 percent that I'm aware of today, you know, working on the 2020
*  20, 20, 20, 25 issue, we see all the time.
*  There's been a number of great journalism done by done in The Washington Post
*  exposing how the food industry pays dietitians to promote,
*  you know, certain a certain ideology around food that all foods are cool.
*  You know, you just have to eat less and move more. All foods fit.
*  There are no good or bad foods, which, yeah, it's hilarious.
*  It's hilarious. It's crazy. Yeah.
*  I mean, these companies, they they pay these people
*  that are body positive influencers as well.
*  Yeah. So they're they're basically paying people
*  that are ill because of eating these things to tell other people
*  it's OK to eat these things and that it's somehow or another phobic,
*  whether it's fat phobic or whatever it is to not encourage body positivity.
*  And it's stupid. It's just stupid.
*  It's stupid for the people that are getting it.
*  It's it's stupid for the people that are promoting it.
*  It's stupid for our culture to be inundated with this nonsense
*  and misinformation where we have to sort through it
*  and try to do deeper research and conduct, conduct, you know,
*  consult people who actually understand what's going on.
*  It's so disheartening that we live in this world.
*  It's so compromised by money that information about key things
*  like your own health is so distorted that it's hard.
*  You know, you talk to people and so many people have like a basic
*  misunderstanding of what is good and not good for you.
*  And all of it is because of this kind of thing,
*  that it's just so prevalent and it's so confusing.
*  And you're getting expert advice from people,
*  which is one of the wildest ones for me.
*  When you look at, oh, thank you.
*  Did some coffee in your system.
*  That fellow. Cheers, sir. Cheers.
*  Good to see you. Same.
*  One of the things is crazy to me is that we get expert advice
*  from people that are clearly sick.
*  How many times have you had nutrition or dietary advice
*  from someone who is obese? Yeah.
*  You're fat. You're you have no muscle.
*  Your body looks like it's just in decay.
*  And you're the person giving advice. Yeah.
*  I mean, most of the social media,
*  you know, personas that I've observed that purport to be experts or that,
*  you know, that that seem to have, I don't know whether it's
*  through credentialism, a degree of authority.
*  I mean, I wouldn't send a loved one to.
*  You know, it's just gaslighting on a on a mass scale, because, you know,
*  your your average person today comes across this ideology
*  that all foods are fine. It's all good.
*  And they try to reduce their consumption of the crap that they're already eating.
*  And they end up failing at that because it's really hard
*  to moderate your consumption of these foods, which have been engineered
*  to be consumed quickly and regularly.
*  And then they feel as though they're, you know, they feel they feel
*  moral failure and and then it just creates this vicious cycle of yo-yo dieting.
*  We're not being honest about the way that these foods impact behavior.
*  And today, 60 percent of the calories that your average person
*  consumes comes from ultra processed foods, which are foods
*  that are highly calorie dense.
*  They are nutrient poor.
*  They are minimally satiating.
*  They're uber delicious.
*  I mean, they push your brain to a bliss point beyond which self controls
*  is seemingly impossible.
*  And by the way, it's these ultra processed foods that are a major route
*  of ingestion for these kinds of chemicals that we're talking about,
*  these industrial chemicals, forever chemicals, you know, ultra processed foods are,
*  you know, if you want more phthalates in your body,
*  consume more ultra processed foods.
*  There was a study that recently was published that found that for every 10
*  percent increment in ultra processed food consumption,
*  pregnant women were ingesting about 14 percent higher levels of these phthalates.
*  Right. I mean, you had you did such an amazing episode with Sean
*  Aswan a couple of years ago talking about the fact that our exposure
*  to these chemicals are reducing the anal genital distance in boys.
*  Right. Which is a which is a very easy one.
*  I don't know if easy is the right term, but it's a very it's a very simple
*  proxy to use to identify how these compounds might be affecting us.
*  Right. But that's only what you can observe.
*  Like, how are these chemicals affecting us in other ways?
*  Right. You know.
*  And and so it's crazy.
*  And these are the kinds of these are the kinds of foods that we're just eating
*  en masse day in and day out.
*  And 60 percent is the average.
*  Children consume about 70 percent ultra processed foods today.
*  On average, black Americans, unfortunately, consume 80 percent ultra processed foods.
*  And there's obviously this is not all choice.
*  There are systemic issues.
*  Many people today still live in food deserts.
*  Accessibility is an issue. Cost is an issue.
*  I know all that. But the messaging that we're getting from our most
*  trusted sources is essentially that everything's fine.
*  Just eat less, move more. Yeah.
*  And it's so difficult for the average American to access
*  information from people that they can trust or to figure out who to trust.
*  You know, you get experts that tell you, oh, you don't need to take supplements.
*  You just need a well-balanced diet.
*  And you go, oh, vitamins are bullshit.
*  And you have people expressing that. Yeah.
*  It's just how could someone say that when there's so much data
*  on the efficacy of vitamins and the benefit of vitamin supplementation?
*  Of course. And vitamins.
*  I mean, we need vitamins.
*  Supplements can be really helpful.
*  And I get asked this a lot, like, who do you know who to trust on social media?
*  I think a really good heuristic is, you know, somebody actually
*  I was giving a talk recently and somebody somebody
*  highlighted that one good indicator of somebody who is is likely trustworthy
*  is somebody who is willing to present the opposing viewpoint
*  and not straw man the opposing viewpoint, but actually steel man
*  the opposing viewpoint, like to actually make clear what the opposing viewpoint is.
*  And then to refute that viewpoint.
*  So they're not ideologically connected to the exact result.
*  Exactly. Yeah.
*  So I try to do that.
*  I try to, you know, share where I've changed my mind in the past
*  or where I've evolved my viewpoint.
*  I try to be clear about the things that I don't know.
*  I don't know. You know, I'm also not trying to be one of these people
*  on social media that like purports to know everything, to have the magic
*  routine or protocol, you know, for for every for everything,
*  you know, as like some kind of, you know, all knowing
*  arbiter of health information, because I feel like there are still so many unknowns.
*  And I could easily one day develop what it is that my mom developed.
*  I hope I don't.
*  I had a health scare in 2022 that,
*  you know, just proved to me that, you know, there is a lot of like luck
*  that goes into this, you know, into this equation as well.
*  My back hurts. I don't know how to fix that.
*  Like, you know, what have you been doing for your back?
*  Well, I try to give bulging discs.
*  What do you have? Oh, man, I have like mild or it's probably
*  progressed, but it's like this desiccation between L5 and S1.
*  And then so it's like basically a dehydrated disc.
*  And which I got from just squatting improperly 10 years ago.
*  And my back's like never been the same since.
*  Have you ever used a reverse hyper?
*  No, you don't know about that. No.
*  It was a piece of machinery that was designed by
*  Westside Barbell, Louis Roberts,
*  Simmons, Louis Simmons, sorry.
*  Louis Simmons from Westside Barbell developed this machine
*  that strengthens the back and actively decompresses the back.
*  And what it is, is your body weight with your chest down
*  sits on this bench and underneath it, you hook your legs to this thing.
*  That's like a leg curl.
*  And you lift up, which strengthens your back.
*  And on the D cell, when it brings it down, it's actively pulling your back.
*  And it's phenomenal. Whoa. It's really good.
*  It's really good at decompressing your back.
*  It's really good at strengthening all the muscles around your back
*  to keep your back stable.
*  This is the machine right here. We have to him.
*  Yeah, we have the rogue version of it out there in the studio.
*  I could show it to you after we're done here. But I love it.
*  It's phenomenal.
*  And it's great for developing leg strength and hamstring strength
*  and glute strength.
*  But really, I use it for lower back for decompression.
*  Show a video, Jamie, if you would, so you could we could see how it worked.
*  This is Louis. He was on the podcast back in the day.
*  He was an amazing guy and very innovative.
*  So he was a power lifter and developed some back problems himself.
*  But you see how on the downswing, it's it's actually pulling your back
*  and you can feel it pull your back so you can feel it like separate everything.
*  You feel like little things pop in there and it provides relief.
*  And for him, they were telling them he had to get his disc fused
*  because he had too much compression.
*  He said, well, what about decompression?
*  And they were reluctant to consider that.
*  And so he's a genius, a fitness genius.
*  And so he designed a machine that would actively decompress the spine
*  while strengthening the muscles around it.
*  Whoa, that sounds awesome.
*  Yeah. Have you done any decompression stuff?
*  I bought this thing that you like hang upside down on it that,
*  you know, I mean, this was like a couple of years ago.
*  I don't know if it helped that much.
*  You know, it actually has helped me a lot.
*  I took up during the pandemic boxing. Really? Yeah.
*  OK, so what's going on is strengthening your lower back, which is helping you.
*  That's helped. Yeah. Yeah. You need to strengthen it for sure.
*  This is better.
*  Another thing when you're talking about the hanging,
*  you're talking about a teeter, right?
*  Which teeter I'd like that that unit.
*  But teeter makes what I think is a far better unit, which is the decks. Whoa.
*  And so we have that outside, too.
*  And what that does is instead of hanging from your ankle,
*  so your legs tense up and your legs resist the weight of your body.
*  Instead of that, everything hinges down from your hips.
*  And you will like immediately feel when you get out there,
*  your back popping and decompressing.
*  I use that every day.
*  Well, it's called the Dex Dex two.
*  And, you know, you just buy it off Amazon.
*  It's not expensive.
*  You also could do back extension exercises on it.
*  It's very versatile machine.
*  But man, for decompressing the back, I've never found anything better.
*  Changed my life. That's awesome.
*  And I also use those kinds of things with weight.
*  So what I'll do is I'll hold two 20 pound dumbbells in my hands
*  and I'll do back extensions.
*  So I'm developing strength around all those lower back issues.
*  I've had a lot of back issues from this generation from jujitsu, you know,
*  20 years of wrestling with men and getting your neck strangled.
*  And it's like it does a lot of stuff to your to your back. That's not good.
*  And you've never had surgery, right?
*  No. Everyone that I know has had problems.
*  I do not know anyone that has had back surgery.
*  That's like that's the best thing I ever did.
*  Everyone like Daniel Cormier, UFC champion.
*  You know, he's like I was never the same once they cut my back open.
*  It was never the same.
*  There's ways to also deal with it with stem cells.
*  And one of the things they're doing now, because the FDA has such restrictive
*  rules on stem cells, people are going overseas and other countries to do it.
*  And I have some friends that run a clinic down in Tijuana,
*  the Cellular Performance Institute, and I know many people,
*  including a good friend of mine, my friend Shane Dorian,
*  who is a world champion surfer, who's had pretty severe back problems.
*  He went there and they they're injecting directly into the discs.
*  And there's a very strict protocol of recovery.
*  You're not doing anything physical for like a couple of months after that.
*  You can walk essentially.
*  They don't want any stress on the back, anything that's going to impede
*  the healing process.
*  He said within six months after that, all of the issues that he had went away.
*  Wow. Getting up in the morning, it was always like, oh, just stiff.
*  No stiff. Like a new back now.
*  Wow. Wild. Yeah.
*  And you could do that again and you could do it again and you could do it again.
*  Like it's not like a thing you could only do once. Right.
*  It's not like a surgery that they're going to go in and remove part of your disc.
*  So they do that.
*  The disectomy, they'll take a chunk of your disc out that's pressing against a nerve.
*  But now guess what? Now you have less disc tissue.
*  You have less cushioning in between your spinal column, which is not good.
*  And this is a way that they're doing now that seems to work.
*  And it's certainly at least worth a try, you know, for people that are
*  considering something that can have life changing effects.
*  Yeah. I mean, whenever I sneeze, I have back pain,
*  tilting over a sink, putting on my underwear. It's it's
*  you know, but I live with it.
*  Like I mean, I'm strong.
*  I'm, you know, the strongest I've ever been.
*  I mean, you know, good shape.
*  But it is my it is sort of my Achilles heel.
*  Do you ever do windmills like kettlebell windmills?
*  No. Another phenomenal lower back exercise.
*  Great for the entire core.
*  But it's you you clean and press a kettlebell
*  and then you turn to the side with like you.
*  So if I'm holding the kettlebell up with my right arm,
*  my left foot will be pointed that way with your knee bent.
*  And you drop down like this.
*  Whoa. Yeah. And all the way up like that.
*  And so it's on both sides.
*  It's strengthening all the supporting muscles around your spine.
*  And it just gives you much better range of motion.
*  I could feel things that sort of pop and move and twist around when I do it.
*  It's great. Whoa. Love it. Yeah.
*  Nominal. I'm going to do that. Yeah. Turkish get ups.
*  Another one. Do you ever do those?
*  Not not a very sexy exercise, but phenomenal for your core
*  and just your overall ability to move things,
*  you know, because it it it strengthens all of the connecting areas.
*  Instead of strengthening different specific muscle groups,
*  it's it really is working on strengthening all the weaknesses in your system.
*  You know, you know, Turkish get up works.
*  So you're lying flat on your back.
*  You press this up. You sit up.
*  You get to one knee, you post the other knee, you get up,
*  you stand up straight and then you lower yourself back the same way.
*  Very, very difficult exercise.
*  Difficult to do, but phenomenal for the whole thing. Wow.
*  And I think one of the problems that people have when it comes to weightlifting
*  and developing problems and, you know, I've certainly had plenty,
*  is that you're overloading certain muscle groups
*  and then all the stuff that connects things together, the lower back, the neck,
*  all these different issues, they they happen because your whole system
*  is not strong uniformly like you're you're developing
*  strong muscle groups like quads, you know.
*  But, you know, how what how are the hamstrings?
*  How are the things behind your calves?
*  How are you know, how are your tib muscles?
*  How was how's your lower back like what's what's going on?
*  What exercise have you done to make sure that your spine is protected?
*  I find that unilateral movements are really helpful, like Bulgarian split
*  split squats. Oh, yeah. As painful as those are to do.
*  I find that those help a lot.
*  And they don't aggravate aggravate my lower back at all.
*  Like I can't I can't barbell squat.
*  I can't even really because my range of motion is now so limited.
*  Do like leg presses like on the machine.
*  Your range of motion for your back?
*  Well, do leg presses.
*  It's just limited in the sense that like my I don't know.
*  I don't I don't know the terminology, but it's like hip mobility
*  or something like my legs only get to a certain point
*  where I get that butt wink thing, you know, like my lower back starts curving up.
*  OK, words on the press.
*  And that's like strain.
*  Do you do slant board exercises?
*  No, I don't know. What is that? OK.
*  There's a guy called the slant board guy that made this dope product.
*  And one of the things I love about his go to slant board guys page.
*  One thing I love about his is his has these little hooks on the side
*  where you can add bands to it as well.
*  And so what a slant board is is a board that you do squats on
*  where the back of it is raised.
*  So your toes are pointing down, your heels are pointing up.
*  And what this allows you to do is get a very deep bend of the knees
*  and you get your knees that push out over your toes
*  and you really lower, you know, ass to heels.
*  And what I do with those, that's it right there.
*  That's I have that one at home. He made me one of those.
*  So you can do this.
*  He's they're doing it with different exercises here.
*  These are just calf strengthening exercises.
*  I do them with bodyweight squats.
*  And one of the things I do them with is goblet squats.
*  I have very strong legs, but I never do deadlifts
*  and I never do like regular squats.
*  The heaviest thing I squat with is 100 pound kettlebell.
*  So I hold a 100 pound kettlebell in front of me.
*  And then I do goblet squats on that.
*  And what that does is it strengthens.
*  When you have a heavyweight, like a 100 pound kettlebell,
*  and you're holding it in this position just to hold it there,
*  your whole body wants to go forward, right?
*  Because it's like it's all this weight out in front of you.
*  So you're stabilizing it with your lower back.
*  You're stabilizing with your abs.
*  And then you're dropping down very deep into this bodyweight squat
*  and then up for this goblet squat.
*  And I do it on that on the slant board.
*  Phenomenal. And it doesn't put a lot of strain on your back.
*  That's awesome.
*  I've noticed that front squats or yeah, maybe I guess I've used
*  dumbbells to do goblet.
*  Those are great, too. Yeah.
*  Yeah. A lot less load on the spine.
*  So that's that's helped me a lot to and really hard to do.
*  Yeah. So this is it right here.
*  This gentleman's doing it right here perfectly.
*  So he's doing a bunch of different variations of it.
*  So he's doing, you know, oh, look, yeah, he's going side lunges.
*  So the goblet squat is there.
*  So he's got this is a who's this guy right here?
*  Oh, it's on the Slantboard Guys channel.
*  So Slantboard Guy, like I said, he sent me that and he's
*  he's been doing this.
*  He made this quite a long time ago.
*  And I think it's just a phenomenal piece of exercise equipment
*  that I don't I have in every gym I have here.
*  Wow. That's freaking awesome. Yeah.
*  Yeah. I mean, fitness is a huge part of my life, but it's
*  I've been limited for the past decade because of the back,
*  because of the back.
*  Yeah. After this podcast, I'm going to take you next door
*  and show you that reverse hyper and you get to experience that decks.
*  Yeah. Just those two things alone, I think, will provide you tremendous relief.
*  So excited. And the decks you just have in your house.
*  It's like simple, easy to set up. I'm so down. Yeah.
*  Yeah. I mean, you know, there's a lot that I, you know, obviously don't know.
*  But but I know what I know.
*  And I know that from a from a nutritional standpoint,
*  from an environmental exposure standpoint,
*  your average American today is inflicting self harm unwittingly on a daily basis.
*  Yeah. Via the foods, via the exposures.
*  Yeah. We're just constantly taking in things that give us inflammation.
*  Yeah. And, you know, we're our circadian rhythms are all dysregulated.
*  We're more sedentary than we've ever been.
*  We're exposed to I mean, the I believe it was the environmental
*  working group identified 217 industrial chemicals in cord blood,
*  you know, of pregnant women were just were being exposed,
*  you know, from every which way.
*  And it's not necessarily that it's like one compound
*  that's causing all of our problems, you know, but it's it's cumulative injury.
*  It's like we our bodies are resilient, but they can only contend with so much.
*  So you you throw all these exposures
*  against the backdrop of widespread nutrient deficiencies,
*  you know, unprecedented sedentary behavior,
*  chronic stress, poor sleep.
*  And it's a it's a recipe for chronic disease.
*  I mean, it's not to me, it's it's very clear as to why so many of us
*  seem to be suffering.
*  Yeah. And it's very difficult for someone who's swimming in a sea of that
*  to figure out how to course correct.
*  Yeah. And, you know, to to to quote unquote detoxify,
*  which has become one of these contentious words now on social media.
*  Granted, maybe possibly for good reason, because it's used to sell detox
*  supplements and things like that.
*  But I mean, our bodies can detox.
*  We just have to make sure that we're giving our bodies the right
*  the right raw materials to do that.
*  And that's actually one reason why I think, you know, I'm not a carnivore dieter.
*  I'm I'm I'm a big advocate of consuming grass fed grass finished meat.
*  I'm a, you know, huge protein guy.
*  But I do think dietary fiber plays an important role in terms of helping us,
*  you know, detoxify, release some of these compounds when we go to the.
*  How does dietary fiber play a role in detoxifying?
*  So the three primary means in which a body detoxifies is via
*  peeing, pooping and sweating.
*  And when you release
*  bile acids into the lumen of the gut with those bile acids,
*  come compounds of the liver has has essentially deemed
*  has has marked for removal from the body and fiber, dietary fiber,
*  soluble fiber specifically sequesters these bile acids.
*  And they because they're absorbed by the soluble fiber,
*  they disallow reabsorption.
*  And so you poop them out.
*  That's one of the reasons that's that's actually the mechanism by which
*  soluble fiber reduces can reduce LDL cholesterol, it will be
*  because it sequesters bile acids, which your liver creates using cholesterol.
*  And so you you essentially like poop out lipids, toxins.
*  I mean, if you're not pooping on a regular basis, you're harboring toxins.
*  That's why I think that that's probably one of the mechanisms by which fiber
*  seems to be so consistently associated with health span, lifespan.
*  You know, and those observations are not necessarily causal.
*  Like there's healthy user bias there.
*  I think, you know, obviously people who eat more fruits and vegetables today.
*  They likely have other healthy dietary and lifestyle habits like that.
*  That's clear. Right.
*  But I do think there's a mechanism for fiber to help
*  remove some of these toxins and the like.
*  And is the idea behind that mechanism that fiber encourages defecation?
*  Fiber, the soluble fiber, like traps, it basically
*  bile acids get released into the lumen of the gut, which help break down fats.
*  Right. You need these you need these compounds to break down
*  and assimilate fats from your diet. Right.
*  But there's a very small I believe it's at the end of the small intestine
*  where these acids essentially would otherwise get reabsorbed.
*  But because they're trapped by the soluble gel forming fiber, they get passed.
*  And so how is that different than what would happen
*  if you just ate meat and you have these compounds?
*  That's a big question, Mark.
*  But I think that that's something that is not often discussed
*  and should be discussed.
*  One of the potential benefits of fiber is the fact that it helps trap toxins in the gut.
*  And meat does not know meat is meat is a low residue food.
*  Food meat is largely absorbed in the small intestine.
*  I mean, when people, you know, the bulk of stool is made up of fiber
*  and dead bacteria and cells that have been sloughed off the,
*  you know, epithelial layer of the large intestine, small intestine.
*  But yeah, fiber is generally what makes up, you know, the majority of of stool.
*  And if you just eat meat, then what is your stool?
*  Well, I've never personally done a carnivore diet and I'm not a gastroenterologist, but
*  you know, carnivore dieters say that they poop fine.
*  But but I think it's a missed opportunity to not be getting fiber in your diet.
*  I don't think that the carnivore diet long term is is optimal short term.
*  And also, I will say that people that that see reprieve from awful conditions
*  like, you know, Crohn's or, you know, IBS or whatever these autoimmune
*  conditions are that people who adopt carnivore diets like I would never
*  I would never say stop doing this diet that seems to be helping you.
*  Like, I would never say that.
*  So the primary function of fiber that you think is beneficial
*  versus having a carnivore diet is the fact that it can absorb these compounds
*  inside the gut, whereas if you're just eating meat, it's that's not going to happen.
*  Correct. I think that's one of the benefits of fiber.
*  I think fiber fiber has a few benefits.
*  So for one, fiber is satiating.
*  It's not as satiating as protein, but it does mechanically stretch out the stomach,
*  which turns off the hunger hormone ghrelin.
*  So fiber is is fiber containing foods are satiating because it's,
*  you know, are beneficial because they're satiating to
*  for this lipid regulation, hormone regulation,
*  toxin removal function that fiber plays.
*  But then three fiber seems to promote
*  gut bacterial diversity.
*  There are some studies that suggest otherwise that it's not necessarily the fiber.
*  It's fermented foods that play a larger role in promoting gut bacterial diversity.
*  But we know that fiber feeds gut bacteria.
*  And as a result, we get beneficial post biotic compounds like sodium butyrate,
*  which is anti-inflammatory, feeds cells in the gut
*  that use it as a fuel source.
*  So I think there I think there are a few benefits to fiber consumption.
*  You know, I'm not like one of these like, you know,
*  I don't think that fiber is the primary thing that we should be looking for in the diet necessarily.
*  I'm I prioritize protein.
*  I think eating, you know, a protein rich diet, there seems to be many benefits of that.
*  And fiber is not a it's not an essential nutrient,
*  but it does it does seem to do good things in the body.
*  So, I mean, I'm not anti fiber.
*  Yeah, it's one of the weird arguments from the carnivore diet side is that fiber is not necessary.
*  And, you know, when you see these people that have been eating nothing but meat for five,
*  ten years and show an alleviation of all sorts of symptoms of different autoimmune conditions
*  and different issues that they've had, it's it's interesting.
*  Totally. Well, first of all, there's no such thing as a one size fits all diet and plants.
*  People have different tolerances to different plants.
*  You know, it's red meat, for example, is much more well tolerated by
*  the vast, vast majority of people.
*  I mean, there's a complication of Lyme disease known as alpha gal syndrome,
*  where people develop a sensitivity to red meat.
*  But by and large, red meat like you provided you're producing enough stomach acid.
*  You should be able to is that officially a Lyme disease?
*  Or I thought it's from Lone Star tick. It's a different.
*  That yes. Yeah. Yeah. I believe you're right.
*  I believe you're right.
*  I'm not 100 percent sure, but it's it's associated with one of these tick born.
*  I had a buddy of mine got it.
*  Yeah. My friend had it for a year and it actually went away and then came back again.
*  Crazy. Yeah. For a year, he couldn't eat red meat.
*  He was allergic to red meat. I feel for those people.
*  Yeah, it was rough. He's a hunter, too. Wow. Crazy.
*  So he's eating chicken.
*  Yeah. I mean, I love I love my steak. But
*  yeah, so, you know, like red meat generally very, very well tolerated.
*  Chicken, very well tolerated.
*  But it's these plant products, these plant items that seem to, you know,
*  people have different sensitivities to them.
*  So I wouldn't say like you have to eat broccoli or you have to eat spinach.
*  Like people have different, you know, and we're also today,
*  there's widespread gut dysbiosis. So people have problems with their guts.
*  They have immune systems that are not fully competent as evidenced by the
*  the soaring prevalence of autoimmune conditions and allergies and the like today,
*  which I think is attributed to there are many factors that that play a role.
*  You know, it could be overuse of antibiotics.
*  It could be the hygiene hypothesis. We've just become so sterile as a culture.
*  Fewer people today are being our kids are being breastfed
*  or being born via C-section. Travel can play a role.
*  You know, you travel to some foreign country, you get an infection.
*  That changes the microbiome.
*  And so I think like we have these sensitivities that are not that are not surprising.
*  But I think by and large, for most people, these plant plant foods
*  have a lot of good to offer, you know, that the benefits generally speaking,
*  outweigh outweigh risks.
*  I'm glad you brought up the overuse of antibiotics,
*  because there's a very interesting case that belt on the wall up there,
*  the Abu Dhabi Combat Club.
*  That's the most prestigious grappling competition in the world.
*  And the guy who won that is the greatest grappler of all time.
*  His name is Gordon Ryan.
*  He's a guy who's he's only 28 years old, which is really wild.
*  And he's hasn't been beaten in like forever.
*  And it's not whether or not he beats people.
*  It's how he beats them. It's he's that good.
*  He's that he's one of the most dominant athletes of any sport of all time.
*  But he had staph infection, which is very common amongst grapplers.
*  It's very common. People get a lot of staph infections.
*  Well, he was getting it so often that he was essentially on antibiotics
*  for a whole year.
*  And his gut is fucked up real bad to the point where he's like,
*  constantly nauseous.
*  He's seen a bunch of different doctors.
*  They've tried to fix it in a bunch of different ways,
*  and no one can really figure it out.
*  Like when someone has developed a really destroyed gut biome
*  because of antibiotics and long term, like really irresponsible,
*  long term use of antibiotics,
*  what can someone do to try to come back from that?
*  Yeah, I mean, most most people would reach for a probiotic,
*  but there was actually a study that came out a couple of years ago
*  that found that probiotics after a course of antibiotics,
*  I believe the antibiotic was Cipro,
*  actually delayed recolonization of the gut by healthy bacteria.
*  How so? You know, I don't know.
*  But it's just the microbiome is a big buzz term.
*  And there are still so many more unanswered questions and there are answers.
*  I think based on based on my assessment of the literature
*  and I've written about it in my in my books,
*  I think that the best thing to do would probably be just to, you know, to
*  to slowly get back to a diet that contains it's, you know,
*  that contains fermented foods.
*  I think fermented foods have been shown to be really supportive of gut bacteria.
*  Kimchi. Yeah, that's what I like.
*  Yeah, more so than than probiotic supplements.
*  I think fermented foods are really what's up.
*  Kimchi, I'm a huge fan of natto, raw sauerkraut, raw pickles.
*  You have to make sure that they're raw, you know, not pasteurized.
*  But yeah, that that seems to be really helpful.
*  And then essentially just feeding eating because what you feed you breed,
*  you know, so eating.
*  We have a hard time even keeping food down.
*  Yeah, he's in this position where he's like constantly nauseous
*  and he tries to train, but he gets nauseous while he's training sometimes. Hmm.
*  That's rough. What would you recommend to someone like that?
*  Yeah, I would say, I mean, it depends.
*  You know, some people do really well on low FODMAP diets.
*  So like, you know, these fermentable carbohydrates that are.
*  That include fiber, but also include other specific carbohydrates
*  that are that are easily for those, you know, like there's
*  there are certain prebiotic carbohydrates
*  that are found just across the.
*  You know, like throughout the produce section of the supermarket that are
*  usually eliminated when attacking SIBO, bacterial overgrowth
*  in the small intestine.
*  There's a people can Google like there's a whole list of like it's
*  it's a low FODMAP diet.
*  Because Gordon has been doing this, trying to deal with this for
*  like a couple of years now.
*  Here it is. Low FODMAP diets of vegetables, fruits,
*  dairy alternatives, all high high food FODMAP groups.
*  These are low down.
*  And the low stuff is vegetables like eggplants, green beans, bok choy,
*  bell peppers, fruits, cantaloupe, capes.
*  OK, so all sorts of different things that you can eat
*  that can potentially help you. But yeah, so I would.
*  I was on a bunch of medications. It's like nothing's happening.
*  I mean, I would I would probably adopt a low
*  FODMAP diet and at a certain point, you know, again, I'm just speculating.
*  But so, I mean, this could be the worst advice.
*  So don't take take with a grain of salt.
*  But I would probably adopt one of those diets.
*  And then, you know, first, maybe even like an elimination diet,
*  like a really aggressive one.
*  Because people with with with serious gut issues, I mean, again,
*  I'm not like a carnivore advocate, but seem to do really well.
*  At least in the short term on these carnivore diets.
*  So I would say maybe try something like that.
*  If that is too restrictive, then I would try maybe a low FODMAP diet.
*  But you ever thought about trying a carnivore diet just to see what's up?
*  I've thought about it.
*  I would do it. I have nothing against it.
*  I would do it. I just, you know, I think I I enjoy dark leafy greens.
*  I think there's benefit in them.
*  But just to see how I felt on it, I would try it.
*  But it's very interesting.
*  You know, one of the one of the interesting things you do every year, right?
*  Yeah, I pretty much do it most of the time now.
*  I but I'm not strict.
*  I I'll eat fruit.
*  I certainly like kimchi.
*  I like to eat kimchi and steak together.
*  That's like a nice combination.
*  I love that. But most of my meals are meat and eggs.
*  The vast majority, 85, 90 percent of my meals are meat and eggs.
*  And it's like the regulation of my energy levels and credible.
*  It's just changed everything.
*  Like I used to get tired in the afternoon.
*  You know, it used to be like the afternoon, but then I have to power through,
*  get a cup of coffee, wake up, figure out what to do and then go to a show.
*  That's not the case anymore.
*  I'm wide awake all day long.
*  It's very different.
*  It's very different.
*  And when you eliminate
*  essentially most carbohydrates from your diet and then your body starts
*  to produce glucose via gluconeogenesis through absorption of protein and meat,
*  the whole thing changes like you have like a steady,
*  manageable level of energy throughout the entire day.
*  And cognitively, it's been one of the best things I've ever done.
*  When I first started doing it again, I'd gotten off of it for a while.
*  And I first started doing it again.
*  All of a sudden, I was like, Jesus Christ, I have like an extra gear in my brain,
*  because it's like conversationally, it's like for podcasting for me.
*  I found it very beneficial.
*  That's awesome.
*  Yeah, you know, I'm like, I don't.
*  But again, you said like there's no one size fits all.
*  Yeah, for me, that seems to work.
*  I eat a I
*  I would consider myself carnivore adjacent in the sense that
*  I am a huge fan of.
*  I think red meat is a health food, which I know I mean, that saying
*  that in and of itself is a controversial statement today.
*  I take a very protein forward approach with my diet, like I think that protein.
*  There are many benefits to prioritizing protein.
*  It's the most satiating macronutrient.
*  You've got a six fold higher thermic effect of eating protein
*  as compared to carbs and fat.
*  It obviously your body is made of protein.
*  It supports muscle protein synthesis.
*  It halts muscle protein.
*  There's so many benefits to prioritizing protein, which I do.
*  But I do think that, you know.
*  Like dark leafy greens, for example.
*  Is known to be one of the most nutrient dense forms of produce
*  because of its low calorie density, and it's a great source of vitamin C folate.
*  But also, I think dark leafy greens, I mean, take kale.
*  Kale is the top source of these carotenoids called lutein and zeaxanthin,
*  which we know directly support eye health and brain health.
*  And so I don't see a reason to deprive myself of these greens
*  that I know have these compounds that literally migrate up to the brain
*  where they help to reduce oxidative stress.
*  They might even improve the way, you know, cognitive function and the like.
*  I think the arguments against eating those to me always are like some of the silliest
*  is that plants are producing these chemicals to avoid predation.
*  Yeah. And that these phytochemicals are bad for you.
*  And you're like, Jesus Christ, in a world today where there's so much that's bad for you,
*  to concentrate on salad.
*  Yeah. Seems fucking crazy.
*  I don't think anybody's dying from salad.
*  You know, I don't think you should live off salad.
*  And everybody that I know that tries to eat only vegetables winds up feeling like shit.
*  And there's only a few exceptions to that.
*  And again, there's no one size fits all diet.
*  But the people that I know that have gone into a vegan diet, almost all of them get bad blood work.
*  Oh, yeah. And they try to figure out what's wrong.
*  And then many of them try to supplement.
*  And then one day they'll have a piece of salmon and feel like their body just
*  returned on. Then they go, OK, I got to stop doing this.
*  I hear that all the time. Yeah. Veganism is a Psyop to me.
*  It's a it's a it's an ideology.
*  It's an ideology just like any other cult.
*  And once you become a part of that, you lose all objectivity
*  and you're no longer willing to talk about these things in a rational way.
*  You're defending your religion. Yeah.
*  I think one thing that's really interesting is that, you know,
*  even within the nutritional orthodoxy, saturated fat still continues to be demonized.
*  Right. But only three percent of the saturated fat that your average
*  American intakes ingests comes from steak, comes from meat.
*  The vast majority of saturated.
*  If you were just to accept that saturated fat is the worst dietary nutrient
*  one might ingest.
*  By the way, that's a Psyop. Yeah.
*  Literally from the sugar company.
*  Because saturated fat, a fat isn't a fat like are we talking about saturated
*  fat in dairy? Because that seems to have no negative cardiovascular impact. Right.
*  But three percent comes from red meat, excluding mixed dishes.
*  The vast majority of saturated fat that your average American ingests
*  comes from desserts, comes from mixed dishes like pizza, lasagna, egg rolls,
*  things like that. Dairy. Yeah.
*  It made me hungry.
*  But it's like we've demonized steak, right,
*  which is like one of the most nutrient dense things a person can eat. Right.
*  Yeah, we're in a very strange position.
*  This country, at least, is with regards to our understanding
*  of what is actually good and not good for you.
*  You know, when I tell people that I'm that I eat mostly meat,
*  they're like, what about your cholesterol?
*  Like.
*  It's like to try to walk them down the rabbit hole of good cholesterol,
*  bad cholesterol, a balance of cholesterol, cholesterol,
*  as it relates to plaque in the arterial in your arteries.
*  Like, what's really wrong?
*  And is it actual food that most people eat?
*  Is that really what the problem is? Because I doubt that it is.
*  I doubt that it's meat. I doubt that it's eggs.
*  I doubt that that's the problem.
*  And when people are willing to readily consume this process
*  bullshit on a daily basis, but then demonize steak,
*  I'm like, that is one of the dumbest things that we have become accustomed to.
*  This idea that a steak is delicious, but it's ultimately bad for you. Yeah.
*  No, it's we should consume less meat.
*  Bill Gates saying it with a big pot belly. Yeah.
*  Like, Jesus Christ. No, it's it's it's crazy.
*  I mean, I, you know, especially contextually today with the you look at health
*  statistics, right? Like one in two people are almost obese today.
*  Forty percent of people are obese today.
*  And by the year 2030, half are going to be not just overweight,
*  but clinically obese. OK.
*  Half of adults today are have some degree of insulin resistance. Right.
*  We know that 90 percent of adults have some degree of metabolic dysregulation.
*  If you if you factor in things like wastes or circumference,
*  low HDL triglycerides and things like that.
*  And so for for a health expert today to demonize any whole food,
*  any whole food to me is just absurd and and actually really unethical.
*  And red meat is, you know, again and again, it comes up
*  on these lists on, you know, in the data as one of the most nutrient dense foods.
*  I mean, it's the most it provides the most bioavailable source of iron, heme iron.
*  I mean, iron deficiency anemia is still a major global health problem.
*  Last I checked. And red meat is the ultimate iron supplement.
*  It's highly bioavailable. It provides zinc. It provides creatine.
*  It provides carnosine, carnitine, all these really incredible
*  and valuable micronutrients.
*  And again, when talking about steak, that's where three percent of the saturated fat.
*  So what's wrong with steak?
*  What's the big problem with it from a health standpoint?
*  I don't think there is any.
*  And yet there's people that will tell you you need to eat less.
*  Yeah. Which is like so strange.
*  Well, our beef consumption actually over the past few decades has declined.
*  Our chicken consumption has gone up, but we are eating less red meat.
*  And look at our health is trending worse and worse and worse.
*  Where today, your average American is largely on a plant based diet.
*  It's a plant based diet of ultra.
*  It's not a whole foods plant based diet.
*  I'll concede that it's a it's a largely ultra processed plant based bread and ketchup.
*  Yeah. Yeah. But I mean, but it really is.
*  A huge problem.
*  And, you know, foods like eggs. I mean.
*  You know, there was this like thing where for a while
*  it was like all animal source foods are bad, right?
*  The the antidote to diseases to is to is to.
*  Shun all animal source foods, right?
*  But then we started to see, oh, wait a minute, fish is actually associated
*  with better health outcomes.
*  So it's like eat more fish.
*  And then the data came out showing us that, oh, wait a minute, cholesterol,
*  this nutrient that we've demonized for decades, actually has no
*  negative downside, no downside with regard to cardiovascular risk
*  for the vast majority of people consuming dietary cholesterol.
*  Very little impact on serum cholesterol. Right.
*  And then dairy turns out that, oh, my God, wait a minute.
*  It's not low fat and reduced fat dairy that seems to be associated with better health.
*  It's full fat dairy that seems to be associated with better health.
*  What the hell? Right. Yeah.
*  And and so I think I mean, I do think it's just a matter
*  of time before we realize that there is a lot of good to be gained from foods
*  like red meat.
*  But, you know, there's so much politic politic politicization.
*  Yeah. And then people, they sort cite things like the China study,
*  which is very flawed. Yeah.
*  I mean, it's a narrative.
*  It's just a narrative. And.
*  Yeah, I mean, I think like insofar as red meat is a is
*  is highly nutrient dense, very satiating.
*  It's I mean, the perfect antidote to boxed mac and cheese.
*  I mean, how many people for dinner in this country are eating boxed
*  mac and cheese for dinner, noodles with butter, you know, or margarine worse.
*  And and I just think it's a it's a huge shame.
*  And I grew up in a household that was largely, you know, we
*  my my mother had a bias towards vegetarianism.
*  She wasn't a vegetarian. She ate chicken.
*  She ate occasionally fish, but she was very concerned about heart disease.
*  And so she, you know, growing up, we were like she never ate.
*  I never saw her eat red meat and she never ate any eggs.
*  And when she served me my first egg when I was a child, she served me
*  it with a warning to to not eat these with any significant frequency
*  because they have the potential to clog your arteries. Wow.
*  Yeah. She was siopped.
*  She bought into, you know, the advice at the time.
*  She didn't have the Internet.
*  She wasn't, you know, online.
*  But she whatever the magazines or the TV, you know, the nightly news
*  would share about healthy eating.
*  And certainly whatever the marketing, you know, in the supermarket,
*  as she was pushing her shopping cart around the supermarket aisle,
*  anything with a red heart, healthy logo on it would end up in my shopping cart
*  at some point, make its way through my kitchen.
*  And so I grew up on a diet that was largely ultra processed and mainly,
*  you know, I was encouraged to eat
*  low, low cholesterol, low saturated fat diet.
*  I mean, I grew up eating consuming margarine.
*  And I remember the big, the big plastic tub of corn oil
*  that we always had out by the stove.
*  Yeah. Crazy, crazy. Yeah.
*  Crazy. They trick people into taking that stuff.
*  And that's also when you see like incidences of Alzheimer's kick in.
*  Like a lot of that starts to happen right when ultra processed foods
*  get introduced into the American diet, you see an uptick in Alzheimer's.
*  Yeah. Well, we now have data.
*  So like even when I wrote my first book, Genius Foods,
*  this data hadn't even yet come out yet.
*  But we now see for every 10 percent increment in ultra processed food
*  consumption, there's a 25 percent higher risk of of developing Alzheimer's disease.
*  Crazy. Yeah. Crazy.
*  It's it's like.
*  It's the craziest scam to ever get pulled off,
*  that the commonly known foods that people have eaten for eternity, forever.
*  Are the ones that are the problem and that these ultra processed foods
*  that have recently been introduced to a fairly recently
*  been introduced into the American diet.
*  Those are the things that you should gravitate towards.
*  And you still have these personas on social media,
*  credentialed social media personas going to bat for them.
*  Yeah. You know, acting as apologists and getting paid and getting paid
*  and getting paid, which is the dark part of it.
*  It's like they are they are committing a crime against humans.
*  It's an information crime against humans.
*  And it will result in those people taking choices
*  that are negatively going to affect their life.
*  There were 100 percent there was an umbrella review just published.
*  People can look it up.
*  Ultra processed food consumption linked to 32 negative health outcomes in this.
*  In this review, they looked at all of the available research
*  linking ultra processed foods to poor health out to negative health outcomes.
*  They couldn't find one single benefit of ultra processed food consumption.
*  It was all bad.
*  And and again, I think it goes back to the fact that these foods are,
*  you know, we tend to over consume them and they're a route of of ingestion
*  for these, you know, for these forever chemicals and the like.
*  They yeah, they they they they.
*  Yeah, it's just not it's not good.
*  They drive obesity.
*  They drive insulin resistance when consumed en masse.
*  I'm not saying that you can't consume any.
*  I think, you know, like I think it's important to be a pragmatist.
*  And it's not like my diet is 100 percent free of ultra processed foods, but.
*  We consume too many today, and I think part of that has to do
*  with the fact that we're not adequately taught.
*  It's never informed consent.
*  We're not adequately
*  taught how these foods influence behavior.
*  And yeah, it's very unfortunate.
*  Well, I think people are more aware of it now,
*  fortunately, because of people like you that are spreading this information
*  and people hear podcasts and they get it looking
*  an adjusted sense of why they've been they've been misinformed.
*  And that's that's a new thing, you know, and the ability to access
*  information from unofficial sources now, it turns out to be real information
*  and very beneficial. That's a new thing.
*  And so in that sense, we're lucky.
*  But boys in an uphill sludge.
*  Yeah. You know, there's there's so much shit you have to deal with.
*  And so many people are just so they're they're informed.
*  Idea is so incorrect that in order to shift that
*  it takes so much effort.
*  And then they have to deal with all the people around them like, oh, my God,
*  cholesterol, oh, my God, you're going to get this and that.
*  And you have a heart attack.
*  You're going to have a heart attack like what? Yeah.
*  I know there's so many competing voices and misinformation out there.
*  On social media and fear mongering today, I mean, fear mongering
*  with regard to animal source foods, which I think is a problem.
*  I mean, as I've said, I'm not I'm not a carnivore dieter.
*  I think it's just it's just yeah, it's really insane that today
*  anybody would would fear monger of, you know, any sort of whole food.
*  And and I think that really, you know, like I used to be more interested
*  in what's the appropriate, for example, ratio of carbs and fats
*  to one's diet for optimal health.
*  And I really do think it's, you know, for most people, the big leaver
*  diet, dietarily speaking, is to is to reduce your consumption
*  of these kinds of foods, these like what are essentially vending machine foods,
*  things that you just sit on a shelf forever and still be edible. Yeah.
*  And there are other tools, you know, I think intermittent fasting
*  is something that a lot of people are talking about today.
*  I think that's like, you know, there's nothing magic about it,
*  but that can be used as there are lots of tools at people's disposal.
*  And it frustrates me sometimes on social media where you see,
*  you know, people, especially those in the so-called evidence based community
*  that seem to be that that gets so down on what they're simply not up on.
*  You know, they tend to write these tools off as being trivial
*  or, you know, they'll they'll even talk disparagingly about them.
*  And I think whatever whatever tool is at your disposal
*  that you have the ability to use today, I mean, I think that's a that's a great
*  that's a great thing. You know, the more awareness
*  we have, the better.
*  So for your documentary, when you're discussing the causes
*  and the what you can do to sort of mitigate the effects of these things,
*  what what is like, what's the primary concern?
*  And when does some so you say this is a disease
*  that starts to show itself in middle age or begins.
*  And then by the time you see the symptoms, it's already you're in late stage.
*  Yeah. So it's by the time you've you've you present
*  and you're diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.
*  I think that it's it's irreversible at that point.
*  So I think the sooner you can get a handle on your risk factors,
*  you know, some of which include nutrition, but also social isolation
*  is a risk factor.
*  That's interesting. Yeah.
*  And what is it about that that causes it to become a risk factor?
*  Well, I mean, there's that 80 year long ongoing study at Harvard,
*  the study of human development that found that that loneliness is a toxin
*  on par with smoking cigarettes or drinking alcohol.
*  And, you know, I think humans are first and foremost, we're social beings.
*  That's one of the reasons why, you know, a human neonate is born half baked.
*  I mean, we continue our development in the presence of others.
*  You know, they call it the fourth trimester.
*  Relative to other animals in the animal kingdom, a human is born with
*  with zero capacity to survive.
*  You know, we need those around us.
*  And so I think that's it's just hardwired into who we are as a species.
*  We are social beings.
*  And today, whether it's attributed to, you know, living in cities
*  and remote work or social media, it's taking a huge toll on us
*  from a from the standpoint of mental health.
*  And that creates downstream biochemical consequences.
*  I mean, this is not just a, you know, an emotional phenomena.
*  Something that actually has real life, a real life health, health impact.
*  What about exercise in terms of like seeing people
*  who develop Alzheimer's or dementia?
*  What how many of those people are sedentary and how many people develop it?
*  That are avid exercise enthusiasts.
*  That's a great question.
*  I mean, exercise is medicine when it comes to the brain, when it
*  with regard to the, you know, the epidemiology of exercise
*  and dementia risk.
*  I don't think that's clear, because also as people get older,
*  they tend to become more sedentary.
*  But we do know that exercise does have a profound impact,
*  even just light activity.
*  Is there an instance or like a measurable decrease in instances
*  of people that have dementia and Alzheimer's with people that are enthusiasts
*  that have never stopped exercising, like people that are like 70 year old
*  marathon runners? Yeah.
*  I mean, people with greater cardio respiratory fitness,
*  particularly in midlife, seem to have reduced risk in late life
*  for an Alzheimer's diagnosis, because again, it's about being healthy
*  in midlife that really seems to move the needle.
*  So midlife obesity is associated
*  with increased risk for Alzheimer's disease down the line.
*  Being actually heavier in late life is associated with lower risk
*  because people tend to become less well nourished as they get older.
*  So the obesity and Alzheimer's disease connection is actually quite interesting.
*  So midlife obesity is associated with increased risk for Alzheimer's disease.
*  But people who are of heavier weight, as opposed to more frail
*  in late life, seem to be protected. Interesting. Yeah.
*  So just by virtue of one of the things I've always said about heavy people is,
*  boy, if you can get that person to lose weight,
*  they're going to be so strong because they've been carrying around
*  all this weight all the time. Yeah.
*  You know, like my friend, Ralphie May, Ralphie was
*  how big do you think Ralphie was?
*  Is heyday 455?
*  Easy, right?
*  Maybe 500 pounds. Easy.
*  Yeah. Easy over 400 pounds.
*  Well, the guy had these massive legs.
*  I was like, Ralphie, if you could just lose weight,
*  you'd be kicking holes for people like your legs are fucking machines.
*  They're carrying you upstairs.
*  I couldn't walk up those stairs.
*  Oh, what Ralphie May used to weigh over 800 pounds.
*  I don't know if that's true.
*  Ralphie might have exaggerated that he was a little bit of a 350.
*  That's like worthy of the TLC show down to 350.
*  He got down to 350. Interesting.
*  He had a couple of gastric bypasses. He ate through them.
*  Whoa. Yeah. He had a real problem. Oh, my God.
*  He's not with us anymore.
*  I mean, a lot of this research is done using the BMI, which we know is imperfect.
*  Yeah, I'm obese.
*  Yeah. According to the BMI, right? Yeah.
*  But you're obviously not.
*  I have 10 percent body fat and I'm obese. That's crazy.
*  Yeah. I mean, it's not a good it's obviously a shitty diagnostic tool,
*  but as a screening tool, that's how they do a lot of this research.
*  So people with higher BMI in late life seem to have a degree of protection. Yeah.
*  But that's because frailty is like the worst thing. Right.
*  Particularly sarcopenic obesity.
*  So like you're actually you're fat, but you're undermuscled.
*  And so this is one of the reasons why by being well-muscled,
*  is so important from the standpoint of longevity.
*  And that's where protein plays a role.
*  Obviously, resistance training plays a really important role.
*  So the key is to make sure in midlife that you're that you're healthy.
*  Midlife, healthy and fit.
*  And then later in life, you just have to make sure you don't get frail.
*  Yeah. And at a certain point, you could you could ride the wave of the health
*  that you've you know, the the the robustness that you've cultivated in midlife.
*  But that's why we should the earlier you start with these
*  dietary and lifestyle principles and adopting them and living them, the better.
*  Yeah, that's one of the craziest statistics that significant muscle mass
*  has a reduced impact on all cause mortality.
*  Having significant muscle mass.
*  Yeah. Having like real strong muscles.
*  Like you'll notice like significant decrease in all cause.
*  Oh, yeah. But it's just makes sense because you're stronger, you're healthier.
*  Your body's more vital. It's more robust.
*  It can deal with all kinds of things.
*  Because it's gone through significant stressors on a daily basis
*  in order to achieve this muscle. Right.
*  So you're forcing your body to work.
*  You're forcing your body to stay strong.
*  You reduce the effects of atrophy and all the confounding effects.
*  Yeah. I mean, your muscles produce BDNF, which is brain derived neurotrophic
*  factor, which is like a miracle grow protein for the brain.
*  It helps to promote the growth of new neurons.
*  It encourages the survival of your existing neurons.
*  It's it's a compound that's produced in your muscles
*  and passes its way through the across the blood brain barrier.
*  And we also know that your muscles are the primary site of glucose disposal.
*  You store sugar in your muscles.
*  Your muscles are obviously for for mobility.
*  Super important. Improving insulin sensitivity.
*  There's no better way to to cultivate insulin sensitivity
*  than to resistance train regularly.
*  And we see, again, that insulin resistance
*  is related to glucose hypometabolism in the brain,
*  which is one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease.
*  Another thing they've found is that
*  exercise training with weights, specifically strength training,
*  is one of the best methods to reduce anxiety.
*  It's great. Yeah.
*  There's lots of evidence now meta-analyses even
*  showing us whether it's resistance training.
*  I mean, cardiovascular, it's just it's it's such an important tool for brain health.
*  And that's part of the reason why I mean, I love fitness.
*  And, you know, most of it is what is due to what fitness does for my for my brain.
*  My brain, my mental health. Me too.
*  I can't imagine. I mean, I've taken a couple of days off,
*  just a couple of days off, which is like the most I ever take.
*  And by the end of the second day, I'm like, Jesus, I feel fucking weird.
*  Like, I feel like I have to do something or my body's going to fall apart.
*  Like, I just feel gross, feel anxious.
*  Anxiety is coming on.
*  Like, just don't feel good.
*  And then I work out and I'm like, huh, I'm OK. Yeah, I'm fine.
*  Totally. I think your body telling you like this is you want to exist in
*  like a robust state.
*  There's only one way.
*  There's only one way you have to work out.
*  It's the only way you're not going to be strong unless you work out.
*  It's just I mean, you have there's certain genetic factors,
*  certain people that have like really great genes and they they're strong.
*  They don't do fucking anything.
*  It's crazy. Yeah.
*  But they would be better off if they worked out.
*  They would be healthier.
*  Think about how crazy it is that like older generation,
*  because I feel like we're now we we obviously can appreciate this.
*  And younger generations, we have gyms.
*  I think was it like Arnold Schwarzenegger that helped popularize the gym?
*  Like that gym culture?
*  Probably. Maybe.
*  But like my mom's lane.
*  Yeah. But like my mom's generation, there was no I mean,
*  nobody was resistance training for fun, certainly not women. Right. Right.
*  And then and they were the one they were the targets of like
*  they were that they were the bullseye of that of precisely that messaging.
*  Avoid cholesterol, avoid saturated fat, you know, low fat, this low fat, that.
*  And they weren't working out.
*  And it's it's really sad when you when you look around and you see
*  that generation. Yeah. And their health. Yeah.
*  And the differences between I mean, there's been a bunch of internet
*  memes about this, the difference between like an 80 year old woman
*  who regularly strength trains and has been doing it her whole life.
*  And another 80 year old woman who's in a chair, you know,
*  and she's rolling around on a scooter because she can't walk right anymore.
*  Yeah. Yeah, it's really sad.
*  So, I mean, I think we're we're definitely making progress.
*  I think that's one of the one of the upsides of the wellness industry
*  and the and this, I think this fervor surrounding wellness
*  and whether it's group workouts or gym culture, I think it's just it's amazing
*  that that people across the age spectrum now have embraced
*  fitness as a lifestyle and women are lifting weights.
*  And I think that's it's just incredible.
*  How bad is tap water?
*  I mean, I'll say that I grew up drinking tap water.
*  I grew up in New York City.
*  And yeah, I grew up drinking it. Garden hoses.
*  Yeah, I think, yeah, same.
*  I think you're you'd be well suited filtering your water
*  because also, I mean, so one of these compounds that
*  has been directly linked to Parkinsonism that has Dr.
*  Ray Dorsey from University of Rochester has published on
*  called trichloroethylene, and it's still being used in dry cleaning today.
*  But it has been it was used since until the 70s in for certain
*  medical applications, it was used as an anesthetic for pregnant women.
*  It was used to decaffeinate coffee.
*  It was used to extract oil, vegetable oils,
*  readily infiltrates groundwater.
*  And about 30 percent, I believe, of groundwater in the United States
*  is still contaminated with this compound, trichloroethylene.
*  And we know that there are traces of pharmaceuticals and various,
*  you know, compounds in tap water that
*  I think, you know, the dose makes the poison to some degree.
*  So now and then I think it's probably fine.
*  But I do think, you know, filtering your water, running it through a charcoal filter,
*  maybe even a reverse osmosis purifier is probably beneficial.
*  Does that get the fluoride out?
*  A reverse osmosis purifier does.
*  Yeah. But not a charcoal filter.
*  No, there are some.
*  There's one brand.
*  I don't remember the name, but there is there are some picture
*  filters that do claim to remove fluoride. But
*  does the reverse osmosis remove the minerals from the water as well, though?
*  Yeah, it removes everything.
*  So that's not good. Yeah.
*  So you need minerals. You do need minerals.
*  What is hard when you get hard water from a well, you get that white stuff.
*  Too much. What is that?
*  Too many. Yeah, too many minerals.
*  Is that bad for you?
*  You know, I don't know.
*  Probably. I mean, it's probably, you know, in some way, if that's all you're drinking and
*  and who knows what else that water has been able to leach through the pipes
*  or what have you. Speaking of which, have you seen the recent study that came out?
*  It was very recent on
*  these dishwashing pods.
*  Damn. Yeah. No.
*  Dishwasher pods are putting forever chemicals
*  all over your glasses, plates.
*  And can you find that? See if you can find that.
*  I think it just came out very recently.
*  This is not recent.
*  Gut epithelial barrier damage caused by dishwasher detergent, rinse aids.
*  Yeah. I think it's one of them.
*  Yeah. Which one? When was this study published?
*  December 22, 22.
*  There was something that I read.
*  I believe I read yesterday, but that they're they're starting to seriously consider.
*  Health news, Bloomberg.
*  OK. So, you know, one of the major problems with with endocrine disruptors
*  are to Joe is that in the field of toxicology,
*  there's this maxim that the dose makes the poison. Right. Right.
*  Like that we establish the what's called the no observed adverse
*  effect level for a given compound.
*  And then we assume that below that exposure is safe. Right.
*  And so that's why you always say the war, why you always hear
*  that exposure to these compounds is fine because the dose makes the poison.
*  And they're very small, you know, in terms of the doses that we're being exposed to.
*  But the problem with endocrine disruptors, and this is not fully appreciated,
*  I think, by the vast majority of people, is that unlike most compounds,
*  which follow a linear dose response where, you know, you consume too much water
*  at a certain point fast enough and it'll kill you, but below that you're fine.
*  A lot of these endocrine disruptor
*  disrupting compounds have what's called a nonmonotonic dose response.
*  So a nonmonotonic dose response means that at a low level,
*  you might have effects and you might not have effects at a for a period
*  above that dose.
*  And then you might have toxic effects at a much higher dose.
*  You might have completely different effects at a low dose.
*  So low dose toxicity. That's the issue.
*  And hormesis is a perfect example of this working in our favor.
*  And it's a it's a perfect example of a nonmonotonic dose response
*  that we actually want like broccoli sprouts, like broccoli sprouts. Yeah.
*  So at a very low dose, broccoli sprouts, this compound sulforaphane
*  and produced by broccoli sprouts creates a
*  a beneficial effect in the body, a response where, you know,
*  it causes our livers to increase production of glutathione.
*  And we seem to have this protective adaptive response to it. Right.
*  But if you were to consume too much sulforaphane, it would kill you. Right.
*  And so one of the issues with these compounds like phthalates
*  and other endocrine disruptors, but phthalates in particular,
*  is that they have what's called a nonmonotonic dose response,
*  which makes them really difficult to study.
*  And it makes guidelines surrounding them really tricky.
*  And so the idea is that we might be
*  you might experience effects due to a low dose exposure
*  that aren't necessarily killing you. Right.
*  But that are still deemed safe.
*  You know, so it's not quite a linear dose response.
*  It can be, you know, a U shaped curve, for example.
*  And so that's that's a big issue that makes it makes these chemicals hard to study.
*  And that's one of the major concerns within the field of toxicology
*  surrounding these kinds of these kinds of compounds.
*  The hermetic effect is very interesting, right,
*  because something can be bad for you in large doses,
*  but beneficial in small doses.
*  And like this is similar to like what's going on with cold plunges
*  and saunas as well. Right.
*  Like your body has a response to this thing that you stay in that cold water
*  for a long time, it will kill you.
*  Yeah. Stay in that sauna for a long time.
*  It will kill you.
*  But if you can get a healthy dose over a determined period of time
*  and you build up to whatever that is, then you have these great benefits. Yeah.
*  Well, your body has to go through that stress and then responds
*  to that stress and creates a more robust body.
*  Exactly. So you see you have an effect at various dosing
*  with various dosing,
*  you know, exposures.
*  And, you know, in the case of sauna with hormesis, it's actually
*  it's a beneficial thing.
*  But some of these endocrine disrupting compounds,
*  the way that they impact hormones, the way that they impact receptors on cell
*  surfaces, I don't necessarily you know,
*  it's not it's not so clear that a low dose is necessarily safer than a high dose.
*  And that's one of the problems.
*  That's why I think you're better off.
*  You know, when people say that, oh, well, the the the level of phthalates
*  and these ultra processed foods, they're in the parts per billion.
*  You know, we don't actually know how those, you know, how those
*  even as minute as they are, doses to that degree are affecting us,
*  you know, in the short term, certainly not the long term, but also, you know, when
*  when combined with all of the other exposures that your average person,
*  you know, incurs over over a day to day basis, it's just
*  yeah, it's a it's a looming question mark.
*  And so that's why I think it's better to be better to be safe than sorry
*  and practice the precautionary principle and to reduce your exposure when you can.
*  So for pretty much anyone listening to this, that's concerned about Alzheimer's
*  and any form of degeneration,
*  whether it's a Lewy body or any kind of dementia.
*  So first of all, be healthy, be fit,
*  stop eating processed foods, start exercising,
*  limit your exposure to whatever these chemicals are, whether they're,
*  you know, all the endocrine disruptors.
*  What else can someone do?
*  Yeah. Air pollution.
*  Air pollution. How much of a factor is the air pollution?
*  It's a big factor. It's I mean, is it break dust?
*  Is it? Yeah.
*  So this is known as fine particulate matter, PM two point five.
*  And we're now starting.
*  I mean, there were studies, there have been studies in Mexico City
*  where they've taken they've looked at the brains of cadavers
*  across the age spectrum.
*  And even in children, they see pathology that looks a lot like Alzheimer's disease
*  in young children, just from the pollution, just from the pollution.
*  Yeah, they've identified like these, whether break dust
*  or other industrial byproducts of burning coal.
*  Have you seen this new study started in revenue that that's showing that
*  electric cars, unfortunately, produce more of that
*  in the production of electric cars or in the brakes?
*  Yeah, and the brakes, because they're heavier.
*  Whoa. Because it's a heavier vehicle.
*  And there's more of that.
*  And I wondered, like if they included Tesla's in those,
*  because my I have a Tesla and it has regenerative braking.
*  Right. So what that means is like it doesn't coast.
*  Like as I'm driving, like so if I'm driving 60 miles an hour
*  and I see up ahead, there is a stoplight that just turned yellow.
*  I know it's going to turn red.
*  And I have a few hundred yards.
*  I just let off the gas and my car slows down,
*  slows down considerably to the point where I barely have to use the brakes.
*  So a lot of people, when they talk about driving Tesla's,
*  they talk about one foot driving because you're you.
*  You have to use the brakes.
*  You have to stop short or something's going on.
*  But for the most part, if you know how the vehicle works,
*  you rarely touch the brakes.
*  It slows down a lot when it comes near a red light.
*  As you come close to red light, let off the gas.
*  It slows down a lot. Wow.
*  Yeah. I don't have an electric car.
*  And that's shocking.
*  I know that the production, you know, has.
*  There's obviously an environmental toll to the production of these of these vehicles.
*  But it's generally produced less brake dust than gas powered cars,
*  because the but that's just Tesla's.
*  My wife has a Porsche that doesn't have regenerative braking.
*  And it's an electric car.
*  Regenerative braking converts the vehicles kinetic energy.
*  Right. But what about the ones that show that electric cars
*  produce more brake dust?
*  EVs can produce more tire dust because they're heavier and have more torque,
*  which can cause them to wear out tires faster.
*  But I think that what they were saying in the one study that I read, though,
*  was that with many of them, because I don't think most electric
*  cars use the regenerative braking aspect.
*  I don't think that's as common.
*  It's just wild to me that I mean, it's like hubris.
*  You know, we think one day we think we're doing good for the environment.
*  And then the next day, you know, we find out that there are all of these downstream.
*  It's kind of like, you know, people don't, I think,
*  can't wrap their head around the fact that plant production actually leads to crop death.
*  You know, critters and moles and moles on shore.
*  But it's just like, if you're partaking in modern life today,
*  there is blood on your hands.
*  And I don't think there's any way to get around it.
*  You know, you're you're you're leaving a footprint.
*  And I actually think that the focus on greenhouse gas emissions super important.
*  But I think it's it's unfortunately taken the focus away from corporations
*  who seem to get a hall pass when it comes to releasing these kinds of
*  volatile organic compounds and these forever chemicals into the environment.
*  I think that's a real major environmental concern that not enough people are talking about.
*  Yeah, for sure. We're breathing it in.
*  I mean, the nose is the front door to the brain.
*  And that's why I think air pollution, you know, is now being linked to Alzheimer's
*  disease, Parkinson's disease and the like.
*  And it's really concerning.
*  So the uptick in highly polluted
*  environments like Mexico City and the like,
*  what how much of an effect does that have statistically?
*  I mean, the data that I've seen proportionally, I'm not sure.
*  But I know that it's it's significant and it depends, obviously, on parts of the world.
*  And more research needs to be done because obviously a very polluted
*  somebody who lives amid serious air pollution.
*  Probably there are other factors at play.
*  You know, they might live in a very industrialized part of a city that might not.
*  They might be lower on the socioeconomic spectrum, you know,
*  so they might have other risks like confounding risk.
*  But you know, I think for it, it depends on where you are.
*  And I don't think there's one cause of dementia for for every person with dementia.
*  I think there are different causes.
*  But certainly when you see that that, you know, when you look at these studies
*  and you see that they had PM two point five in their brains and around the PM
*  two point five, these particles.
*  There's the aggregation of these plaques
*  that we associate with late onset Alzheimer's disease.
*  I mean, that's startling.
*  So I don't know that I don't know the proportion, but I do know that it's
*  it's a it's a significant concern.
*  I don't know if it's, you know, here in the United States, where we have
*  where we have better regulations now.
*  I mean, L.A. used to be very polluted.
*  It's a lot less so these days, for example. I live in L.A.
*  And yet people are still developing Alzheimer's disease, unfortunately,
*  in Southern California.
*  I don't know if if that's as big of a contributor in L.A., but
*  still very polluted, right?
*  I mean, yes.
*  I mean, relative to a rural area.
*  Well, also, not only that, the the the especially in the valley,
*  just the way the topography is like it accumulates all the shit in the valley.
*  Yeah, you see it sometimes.
*  I got to. Mm hmm. Yeah, it's thick. Yeah.
*  I mean, I bought a I have an air purifier in my house.
*  I think it's really important to, you know, to reduce your exposure
*  to buy, you know, I think an air purifier makes sense.
*  I think making sure that your HVAC system has a change that filter regularly,
*  make sure that it's a good filter.
*  I think I mean, there are ways to mitigate exposure.
*  You can damp, you can wet, you can wet dust.
*  So as opposed to using a dry duster that just redistributes dust.
*  I mean, dust oftentimes harbors a lot of these chemicals that we're talking about,
*  whether it's trichloroethylene or plastic, plastic related compounds.
*  You want to sequester the dust in a damp cloth, throw that cloth away or wash it.
*  Vacuuming, I think, is really important.
*  Make sure that your home is well ventilated
*  because homes are now becoming increasingly
*  insulated as a cost saving measure, which has led to an increase
*  in exposure to certain volatile organic compounds in the home.
*  So, yeah, I mean, the you might not be at risk
*  in your house for exposure to fine particulate matter, per se,
*  but you know, you're breathing in all this other stuff,
*  which isn't great for you.
*  And so when you set out to do this documentary,
*  were you trying to just highlight all the issues?
*  Were you trying to present cures or potential
*  mitigating techniques that people can use?
*  Like what were you trying to do?
*  Yeah, so I wanted to, on the one hand,
*  capture what it was that my mom was going through.
*  And as an artist, I mean, it was incredibly painful for me
*  and my family.
*  And so I felt in many ways that
*  by documenting it, it was giving meaning to the whole experience for me,
*  which would otherwise just be purely traumatic.
*  And so I wanted to document what my mom was going through and
*  pay tribute to her and and also to pay tribute to the science of dementia
*  prevention, which, again, 10 years ago, nobody was talking about.
*  And so in the film, it's not a it's not a I wouldn't consider it a diet film.
*  There's no magical diet that's proposed.
*  It's just kind of the hope with the film was to unravel a lot of this sort of
*  misinformation that I think we've been doled out over the past few decades
*  with regard to what we should and shouldn't be eating.
*  But it's not there are other factors that are covered
*  in the documentary, of course. But
*  but yeah, there are it does paint with broad strokes how one might
*  live or eat to reduce risk for dementia.
*  And as I mentioned, we you know, one of the interviewees that is in the film is
*  Dr. De La Monte at Brown, who coined the term type three diabetes.
*  And she talks a little bit about why we see rates increasing so starkly today.
*  And she talks about how it's unlikely to be genetic due to genetics.
*  It's likely to be due to exposure to whether the standard American food
*  and standard American food environment
*  or something else.
*  And we also have one of my mentors, Richard Isaacson, who's the
*  Alzheimer's prevention specialist, who, you know, is at New York Presbyterian
*  while Cornell, whose work I stumbled upon really early.
*  So it's really to kind of like drive home the notion that this condition
*  doesn't begin overnight.
*  You have decades to set yourself down a different path.
*  If you, you know, simply become aware of, you know, the fact that your choices
*  do impact your your brain health.
*  And and so it's it's in part informational, but it's also
*  it's a tribute to
*  my mom and it's a tribute to anybody really, who's
*  who's ever experienced dementia, both as a as a patient or as a caregiver.
*  It's a film that I you know, people will find solace in.
*  And and yeah, it's really cinematic.
*  It's you know, it's it's it's it's hard for me to watch,
*  but it's a it's a film that is
*  I think really emotional, really.
*  It's a really intimate look into what that's what dementia is like.
*  And and my mom is such a charismatic light, you know,
*  and she's so relatable and she's young, you know, she's like in her
*  early 60s in the film.
*  And so for anybody who thinks that this is something that,
*  you know, only affects old people, you know, people, grandma, grandpa.
*  I think it's going to shatter a lot of
*  unhelpful misconceptions that people have about these conditions.
*  Was there anything that your mother found or that you found
*  that helped your mother and mitigated some of the symptoms?
*  Exercise definitely helped.
*  I think it slowed the progression of the condition.
*  But but it also in a significant in a significant way, lifted her spirits
*  because I mean, we know that exercise is really important for mental health.
*  And and it certainly helped.
*  With hers. But it also I mean, there is there is evidence that exercise,
*  whether Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's disease,
*  it's I mean, it's profoundly.
*  Effective as a, you know, I mean, potentially in terms of slowing
*  the condition, improving symptomology, improving quality of life.
*  And so, yeah, I mean, we got her on an exercise regimen.
*  We hired a trainer.
*  And that was really the first time in her life that my mom ever really took exercise
*  seriously, which is crazy to think about.
*  But but yeah, we've got there's a whole generation that didn't think it was necessary.
*  It's it's it's wild to me.
*  I mean, it's such an important part of my life.
*  And it's it's just so good for you from a mental, from a metabolic health
*  standpoint, mental health, brain health, cardiovascular health.
*  It's just like and we've become so sedentary generally.
*  We have to schedule our our activity today.
*  So, yeah, it's not, you know, there is no magic bullet, unfortunately.
*  It's a it's a multifaceted problem.
*  But and we don't we don't yet have all the answers, unfortunately.
*  But my intent was to show people to convince people that, you know, even though.
*  We don't have all the answers, we don't need to sit idly on our hands as we,
*  you know, particularly with the degree of self harm that your average
*  person is self imposing on a day to day basis with the foods that they're eating,
*  with their lifestyles, like we can do things a little bit differently.
*  And the research tends to support that by changing the way that we're doing things.
*  It'll buy us additional years or maybe even decades of cognitive health.
*  Well, that alone, I mean, that's that's an amazing thing.
*  That's the hope. I mean, what my family went through was awful.
*  I wouldn't wish it upon my worst enemy. And
*  and I think that if there's a way that my work can,
*  you know, affect people and prevent one additional case,
*  I mean, that would be amazing. Right.
*  But are there any medications that have promise?
*  Well, there's research now looking at these
*  like some of the glue tied these peptides,
*  some of the glue tied for decades was used as a
*  type two diabetes medication.
*  And now, obviously, it's being used for weight loss.
*  And they're now pushing it on children and people are using it for vanity reasons,
*  which I don't support. But
*  insofar as it's it can lower blood sugar,
*  they're looking now to see if it reduces risk for the development of Alzheimer's
*  disease. They've already shown that it can reduce risk for cardiovascular
*  events, which I think is great.
*  I mean, if it's a last line of defense for you and you need that medication,
*  I'm happy that we have it.
*  And they've shown that it can reduce cardiovascular events.
*  They're looking now to see if it can reduce risk for Alzheimer's disease.
*  And there have already been a few a few trials showing that it might improve
*  cognitive function. Now, the reason for that is that
*  some of the glue actually increases insulin secretion.
*  And this is, I think, just a bandaid.
*  This isn't a fix for the condition, but they've shown that we've known for a
*  decade now at this point that intranasal insulin can actually improve cognitive
*  function because the brain has become essentially insulin resistant.
*  So you're just like hitting it with insulin.
*  And it seems that that can lead to an acute improvement in cognitive function
*  in patients with with Alzheimer's disease, I believe.
*  Has anybody ever done it like for a performance enhancing drug?
*  That I don't know, but there are there are studies.
*  Suzanne Kraft is one of the lead researchers who's published a lot on this
*  over at Wake Forest University.
*  Nasal insulin, intranasal insulin.
*  Yeah, like a like a squirter.
*  Yeah. Wow. Yeah.
*  I mean, it's it for somebody with with because in the in the brain
*  of somebody with Alzheimer's disease, glucose metabolism is is
*  dramatically constrained.
*  And so you're basically like you're shooting insulin straight up into the brain
*  because whatever goes up your nose is like you bypass the blood brain barrier
*  because you've got these olfactory neurons that extend into the nasal cavity.
*  This is one of the reasons why our pollution is so harmful
*  when we breathe it in through our noses.
*  And one of the reasons why people sniff coke.
*  There you go.
*  So they're blowing insulin up the nose and they're seeing that that can
*  that improves cognitive function.
*  And there I think they've already I could be wrong,
*  but I think they've already shown in in a phase one and phase two trial
*  that it leads it leads to an improvement in cognitive function
*  in patients with Alzheimer's disease, some semi-glutide.
*  And so, you know, I think that's potentially.
*  Q-digit administration of intranasal insulin
*  beneficially affected spatial memory and executive function,
*  healthy, normal way to adults.
*  Interesting. Well, longer term application is also improved
*  decorative memory was the difference was decorative memory memory rather.
*  I think it's I mean, I'm actually not sure.
*  I think it's gate. Interesting.
*  They're walking better. Yeah.
*  I mean, weird verbal memory.
*  But the thing is, in the in the brain of somebody with Alzheimer's disease,
*  so one of the reasons why they're calling it type three diabetes
*  is because there's insulin deficiency and insulin resistance.
*  So it kind of has the hallmarks of both type one and type two diabetes.
*  Interesting.
*  Memories that are directly accessible to conscious recollection.
*  OK, interesting facts, data experiences that require through learning.
*  Retrieval of this information is usually intentional
*  and requires the awareness of the individual.
*  Interesting decorative memory.
*  So it seems to you know, you're basically shooting up the brain
*  with a peptide insulin is a peptide that causes it to dramatically, you know,
*  maybe uptake glucose.
*  Insulin's role in the brain is is different than its role elsewhere
*  in the body, for example, skeletal muscle.
*  It's not it's it serves it plays multiple functions in the brain.
*  But, yeah, intranasal insulin has been shown
*  in some studies, but who knows?
*  I mean, maybe spraying insulin up into the brain on a chronic basis
*  increases insulin resistance, and then you become dependent on that.
*  You know, right.
*  So as a last as a last line, like maybe maybe it's it's helpful.
*  You know, in some capacity, but I think that's one of the reasons why
*  semiglutide might help for somebody
*  who's already experiencing cognitive decline.
*  But then also, I mean, yeah, there's I wouldn't there
*  drugs that are helpful in the setting of somebody who's already been diagnosed.
*  They're really there isn't much.
*  There isn't much. I mean,
*  there were these drugs that were
*  were approved and have recently been essentially abandoned.
*  One of the drugs being educanumab by Biogen,
*  because they found it to be effective at reducing the plaque in the brain.
*  But it led to, first of all, there were awful side effects.
*  It actually increased these drugs, increased brain atrophy
*  and didn't lead to any significant improvement in cognitive function.
*  So, I mean, those were a big fail.
*  And and the and the drugs prior to these monoclonal antibodies
*  like educanumab and the like, minimally effective.
*  Like my mom was on pretty much all of them.
*  They didn't do anything for her.
*  So it's it's it's unfortunate.
*  It's you know, I don't I don't think that drugs really have a fighting chance
*  when it comes to a condition that has taken decades to develop.
*  So the only thing that really seemed to help her was exercise.
*  Exercise helped.
*  Exercise helped.
*  And, you know, it's not like I it's not like I put her on some crazy diet.
*  I mean, there's there is really no evidence that any dietary pattern
*  other than maybe the ketogenic diet.
*  Would serve any purpose.
*  I mean, the ketogenic diet, potentially, particularly earlier on
*  in Alzheimer's disease might improve certain quality
*  aspects of quality of life, but it's not a cure
*  and it's a very difficult diet to adhere to.
*  Is this because your brain starts functioning on ketones rather than glucose?
*  So up to 60 percent of the brain's energy needs can be furnished by ketones.
*  Normally, you're under under fed conditions.
*  Your brain is using glucose 100 percent as a fuel source.
*  But your brain also can can use ketones.
*  And it seems to be the case that the brain
*  of somebody with Alzheimer's disease, their, you know, their
*  their ability to generate ATP from glucose is diminished by 50 percent.
*  But their ability to generate energy from ketones is unperturbed.
*  So you can basically supplement the brain's energy needs with ketone bodies.
*  But as a when a person develops Alzheimer's disease, their
*  their preference for sweet foods increases.
*  They actually develop a sweet tooth, which is thought to be the brain
*  essentially crying out for sugar because it's it's starving essentially for energy.
*  And and so getting somebody with Alzheimer's disease to adhere to a ketogenic diet.
*  Incredibly difficult to do, I would imagine.
*  Hmm. Interesting.
*  What about exogenous ketones?
*  I think those might might help.
*  There's not. There's not good data on exogenous ketones,
*  but there is an FDA approved medical food.
*  I believe it's called Axona, which is a medium chain triglyceride based product.
*  Medium chain triglycerides are converted by the liver to directly to ketones,
*  whether you're in a fasted or fed state.
*  And that's actually an FDA approved medical food.
*  We now have various ketone products on the market
*  that I would suspect might have an impact, but I don't I don't know for sure.
*  There is one
*  pediatrician, she's a neonatal pediatrician named Dr.
*  Mary Newport, who's been an advocate for this research for decades at this point,
*  whose husband, Steve, developed Alzheimer's disease.
*  And she knowing what she knew about neonatal nutrition,
*  she started giving him coconut oil before the availability,
*  the widespread availability of MCT oil and these ketone products.
*  And this is an anecdote, but she has written about and reported
*  that when she initially started giving her husband these ketones,
*  he had Alzheimer's disease.
*  She saw a dramatic improvement in his cognitive function.
*  Wow. Like dramatic.
*  She kept giving it to him.
*  Do you see what the dosage was of this coconut oil?
*  Multiple, multiple tablespoons a day.
*  But now we've got better options than that.
*  And I'm not. Is that a bad option?
*  Is coconut oil a bad option?
*  It's not bad, but it's not purely.
*  So coconut oil is there are a few fractions of coconut oil.
*  There's it's predominantly lauric acid, and then you've got capric acid,
*  caprylic acid, there are all these other components of coconut oil.
*  But now you can buy,
*  I believe the most ketogenic fatty acid that comprises coconut oil
*  is caprylic acid, C8, I believe.
*  And it's just a more potent ketone precursor.
*  And there's really no like this is, you know, basically based on anecdote.
*  But at first, she started giving him coconut oil
*  and she reported a significant improvement.
*  And but now we have all these other, you know,
*  ketone products on the market like C8, which, you know, might play a role.
*  We I would love to have more research on this, obviously.
*  But certainly worth a shot.
*  The one caveat I'll say is that, you know, it can cause diarrhea
*  when you over consume this stuff.
*  Mm hmm. So just, you know, be mindful of that.
*  Be careful, kids. Yeah.
*  Nobody wants that.
*  What other things can be done?
*  Hmm. I mean, you know.
*  What about cold exposure, heat exposure?
*  Does that any of that cold plunge and sauna have any effects?
*  And it obviously has a big effect on dopamine and norepinephrine.
*  And yeah.
*  There's research out of
*  the University of Finland showing that sauna use is associated with
*  pretty dramatically reduced risk for Alzheimer's disease,
*  also stroke, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, all cause mortality,
*  all cause mortality. Yeah.
*  Now, that's an observational study.
*  But I think it's it's potentially more telling
*  that it was a study done in Finland, because in Finland,
*  Finland is the sauna capital of the world.
*  There's one sauna on average per household in Finland.
*  And so it kind of removes a bit of the healthy user bias
*  that you might see doing that same study here.
*  You know, people here in the United States,
*  people who regularly use saunas, maybe they're more well off.
*  They have spa access.
*  You know, they've got fancy gym memberships
*  or they can afford to have a sauna in their homes.
*  But in Finland, it's like one sauna. It's like a shower.
*  It's like one sauna per house.
*  And in that observational study, they saw consistent health benefits
*  due to regular sauna use two to three times a week.
*  I think it was like,
*  I want to say close to 20 percent reduced risk,
*  four to seven times a week, 35 to 50 percent reduced risk.
*  Again, observational, but mechanistically
*  saunas, they do get your heart rate rate going.
*  They do seem to ultimately reduce blood pressure.
*  Even though they raise it acutely when you're sitting in a sauna.
*  It's like it's like a workout that you can self impose
*  while sitting absolutely still. Yeah. Which is amazing.
*  Yeah, it is amazing. Stationary cardio, stationary cardio.
*  Exactly. It's a great way to put it.
*  And it's good for mental resilience. Yeah.
*  I love I'm a huge fan.
*  I don't get to do it as often as I as I would like.
*  And it's also when you sweat, you're releasing like you.
*  You sweat out phthalates.
*  You know, you release a lot of these chemicals
*  that we're being exposed to on a daily basis through your sweat.
*  You poop them out, you pee them out.
*  And and so I think it's a really great health modality.
*  I mean, it's not we don't yet know for sure that it's causally related to,
*  you know, to Alzheimer's prevention.
*  But I mean, I would I would assume that there's a real effect happening there.
*  When you look at all of the different things that are available today
*  to improve your health, when you look at lifestyle choices,
*  dietary choices, exercise choices, what is
*  is there a way like if a person's listening to this,
*  like what's the best step forward?
*  Like if you if you're listening to this, you know what I am.
*  I'm making a choice.
*  My life is a disaster.
*  I eat like shit. I'm sedentary.
*  Yeah. Well, I think how do I jump in?
*  How do I jump in?
*  Well, I think you don't want to you don't want to break off more than you can chew.
*  Right.
*  I think that's a big mistake that people make.
*  You want to try to adopt one new habit at a time.
*  And after that habit cements, then you can try adding in another habit.
*  But for some, you know, for some people, it might be as simple as
*  drinking a glass of water before your first cup of coffee in the morning.
*  You know, just like hydrating yourself before that first cup of coffee.
*  And then once you start doing that, maybe start to look at breakfast.
*  You know, breakfast.
*  There's all this data now coming out showing us that I used to think
*  and this is an area where my thinking has evolved.
*  I used to think that breakfast was non-essential.
*  Some like, you know, that the later in the day we can push our first meal,
*  the better.
*  You know, we would get some kind of like autophagy
*  brownie point or something like that.
*  But actually, the data has come out showing us that when we eat a protein
*  rich breakfast first thing in the morning and we consistently eat that every day,
*  it does a really good job at regulating our hunger levels throughout the day.
*  We subsequently when we eat a high protein breakfast, we eat fewer calories
*  over the subsequent 24 hours.
*  And I think that's really important.
*  I mean, how many people today start their days with a, you know, coffee drink from,
*  you know, and then maybe a bowl of cereal.
*  It's like starting your morning with dessert.
*  Right. That's how so many people start their mornings today. Right.
*  A bowl of sugar sweetened cereal, coffee with sugar and.
*  Fruit juice, you know. Yeah.
*  And it's a I mean, that you're setting yourself up
*  for hunger, dysregulation.
*  It's just no bueno stress, you know, and
*  and so start try starting your day with a with with a protein rich breakfast.
*  You know, try to hit 30, 40, maybe even 50 grams of protein
*  with your first meal of the day.
*  It's a great way to assuage your hunger to make sure that you're going to be,
*  you know, come lunchtime, you're not going to be up against the wall
*  looking for the quick sugary fix from the vending machine or from the,
*  you know, the rec room or the cafeteria or whatever.
*  I think it's a it's a great first healthy habit to adopt.
*  And and that's going to influence your behavior subsequently down the down
*  the, you know, down the line.
*  I also think it's really it can be really useful to try to be
*  as present with your food as possible.
*  I mean, I'm guilty of eating on the run just as much as, you know,
*  anybody else today, but studies show that when we're distracted,
*  when we're eating, we tend to consume more calories, about 15 percent more calories,
*  which doesn't seem like a lot, but you consume, you know, 15 percent
*  more calories with every meal every day.
*  And that's that adds up to a spare tire over time, you know.
*  You want to you really want to major in the majors and
*  as opposed to the minors, which I think many people do today.
*  So, you know, prioritizing whole foods, it's like that's like the
*  if there's one dietary tip, you know, I really think that that's it,
*  because in so doing, you are optimizing for satiety.
*  We know, thanks to NIH funded research, research that when people eat
*  largely an ultra processed diet, they tend to over consume
*  their calorie budget for the day by about 500 additional calories.
*  And this is intentional.
*  I mean, this is something that's been engineered into these overprocessed.
*  Engineered. Yeah, it's engineered.
*  And nobody's being honest about this.
*  You know that these foods are literally designed to be over to be over consumed.
*  It's not as you're not a failure for over consuming them.
*  That's the way that they're that's how you're meant to respond to those foods.
*  Yeah. And it's the food industry. Right.
*  They're they're certainly playing a role, but it's also your own biology.
*  It's like how your brain and your taste buds have evolved because food,
*  the ubiquity of food hasn't always been a thing.
*  You know, we've for the vast majority of our time on this planet,
*  food scarcity was a real issue.
*  There were more underweight people walking the earth than underweight.
*  Now that seesaw has flipped.
*  Now we are living in the for the first time in human history.
*  There are more overweight people walking the earth and underweight
*  due to, you know, this phenomena, this westernization of of our diets.
*  I think it's also very important what you said about not biting off more
*  that you could chew and just try to take on one healthy habit at a time
*  and build up to that, because it's been shown that habits,
*  if you can continue them for a predetermined period of time,
*  I think it's 90 days or something like that.
*  Once it gets to around 90 days, those habits become sort of cemented in
*  to who you are. Yeah. I mean,
*  I started making my bed a year ago.
*  I'm in my 40s.
*  I've never made my bed until about a year ago.
*  And it's a habit that now I've cemented, you know,
*  so you can teach an old dog new tricks. That's a funny one.
*  Yeah, I've started making my bed. Yeah.
*  And that could also be walking around the block.
*  It could be, you know, having an exercise routine.
*  You start off with just simple push ups and sit ups and body weights,
*  squats or something every morning. Get your day going with that. Exactly.
*  And if you could do it every day over a long period of time, you'll see results.
*  And if you're if you're really sedentary, like if you've never stepped foot
*  into a gym, you don't know what to do.
*  First of all, gyms are the most welcoming places to newbies.
*  So don't be intimidated by that.
*  Some of the most jacked guys in my gym are the sweetest dudes
*  and are always willing to, you know, that's their thing that they enjoy doing.
*  They're happy when more people do it. Yeah.
*  I mean, I don't know if it's because the way, you know,
*  this is revealing, but I've never been asked for my advice in the gym, you know.
*  But but, you know, I'm happy to I'm happy to give it.
*  But generally, like people in the gym are friendly. They're nice, you know.
*  They're also experiencing the endorphin rush of the exercise and they're happier.
*  I love giving out unsolicited advice.
*  I do it sometimes in the gym and I get weird looks.
*  I probably shouldn't because I live in West Hollywood.
*  But but it's a yeah.
*  I mean, people get intimidated by the gym environment.
*  And I think it's it's really a shame because some of the nicest people,
*  you know, are people don't know where to start.
*  You know, that's the problem.
*  And it's so intimidating to like walk into this place where everyone's so familiar.
*  They're they're already so far on their fitness
*  journey path that, you know, you look at their body like that.
*  That's not my body. I can never be like that.
*  I can't. I'm never going to look like that.
*  They had to start somewhere.
*  They had to start somewhere.
*  And here's the thing about about fitness is that it's like it's not
*  it's not once you adopt it into your life and you embrace it
*  and you embrace the lifestyle, it's like the rising tide
*  that lifts all the boats in your harbor because the discipline, you know, the
*  the discipline that it takes that you, you know, that habit once cemented.
*  I mean, you can apply the things that you learn in fitness
*  to so many other areas of life.
*  It's just such a it's so powerful.
*  And if if if lifting weights is intimidating to you, if, you know,
*  if you're not even walking on a daily basis, then start there.
*  Maybe just, you know, go on more walks. Yeah.
*  But just to walk around your block. It's good.
*  So it doesn't seem like you're doing much, but you really don't walk that far
*  on a normal basis. Yeah.
*  You know, you walk to your car, you walk to your office,
*  you walk to the lunchroom, like whatever you're doing.
*  If you can just force yourself to walk a mile, just one mile,
*  that's like so much more than you ever walk in, you know,
*  in one unbroken period of time. Oh, yeah.
*  I mean, living in L.A., it's really difficult sometimes to get those steps in.
*  But the whole 10,000 steps thing is a bit
*  that kind of came from nowhere, actually.
*  10,000 steps as sort of like six feet distancing. Yes.
*  Yeah, just like that, actually.
*  Although unlike six feet distancing, there have there has been some research
*  to come out since that kind of hit the cultural zeitgeist. Yeah.
*  Showing that, you know, it's actually a pretty good target, you know,
*  somewhere in the range of 7000 to 10,000, 10,000 steps a day.
*  And it's doable and it doesn't kill you. It's not that hard. Yeah.
*  Like if you listen to a book on tape and you go for a walk or a podcast,
*  it's easy. It's not that bad. Yeah.
*  And if you can just do that every day and then work your way up to some other stuff.
*  And then once you get the courage up, take a class, take a yoga class,
*  take a martial arts class, do something where it's fun to do
*  and you're getting your exercise in exactly, which is a really great way to do it.
*  I go to the gym and I just walk on the treadmill. I'm not a runner.
*  I've never liked running.
*  I know many people do and power to them.
*  I've never liked it. And now with my like low back stuff,
*  it's like become even more aggravating.
*  But I just I get on the treadmill and I walk like I walk on the treadmill.
*  And it's incredibly gratifying.
*  You know, you can put that put that incline up, you know, to six, seven, eight, nine.
*  And it's a it's a fantastic cardiovascular workout.
*  It really is. Yeah. Yeah. Especially with a high incline.
*  I do it with a weighted vest and a high incline rocking.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I just watch a movie.
*  Just fucking suck.
*  Just suck trudging.
*  It's amazing how hard it is on your feet.
*  That's what's kind of crazy.
*  Like your feet get tired. Yeah. You know.
*  But it's so good. I mean, it's like, you know, when yours your body is,
*  I mean, it's very intricate network of tubes and pipes
*  and not every fluid in your body has its own heart.
*  You know, so the movement is actually, I mean,
*  it can help prevent cancer.
*  Exercise is a powerful cancer protective modality
*  because you've got, you know, these immune vessels, your lymphatic system
*  is relies on movement, right.
*  Flexing your muscles actually pushes fluids around your body
*  that don't otherwise have a pump.
*  And your brain, when you're sitting for an extended period of time,
*  blood literally drains from your brain and just a brief walk
*  every 20 minutes of sedentary time, brief walk, just, you know,
*  it oxygenates the brain and you can feel it.
*  What's one of the reasons why writers like to go for walks after they write
*  and helps them review their material?
*  You like a lot of guys do that.
*  They they'll write early in the morning and then they go for a walk
*  and they'll bring a tape recorder or their phones, they use the voice notes.
*  And as they're walking, they'll start reviewing their material
*  and thinking about their material as they're walking.
*  And then like maybe a new idea will come.
*  Because, you know, you're getting the heart rate, the oxygen, all the endorphins.
*  And then you're also in this thing where you're just walking
*  and just thinking.
*  And as you do that, ideas start to sprout. Hmm.
*  Very common amongst writers to go for a walk after the initial right of the day. Hmm.
*  Yeah. Also helps blow off steam.
*  And yeah, it's it's incredible.
*  Reminded me of this post, Rhonda Patrick, Rhonda Patrick.
*  Ten body weight squats every 45 minutes is more effective at blood sugar regulation
*  than a 30 minute walk.
*  Well, that's even better. How about that?
*  Easy to do also. Oh, yeah.
*  Ten body weight squats every 45 minutes.
*  Is that for the whole day?
*  I mean, during an eight hour period of sitting.
*  Yeah. Not hard, brief, intense bursts of activity, often called exercise snacks,
*  offer a potent strategy to mitigate the health risks associated
*  with our sedentary lifestyles.
*  Yeah. Exercise snacking.
*  Yeah, that's a thing.
*  That's a thing that's been referenced in the in the exercise literature
*  and seems to be super effective.
*  I know a friend who did that that radically improved his pull ups.
*  And so he put a pull up bar in his house and he would just walk by the pull up bar
*  and just do a couple. Wow.
*  And he would just do it throughout the day, just every now and then
*  do a couple of pull ups.
*  I mean, it sort of like lines up with the strength first philosophy
*  of Pavel Tatselin and all the talk of kettlebell work.
*  Like, do you do any of that stuff?
*  Do you know what his ideas were?
*  No, not really.
*  The idea was you should never do anything to failure.
*  And that this idea of doing things to failure is you're just trying to rush
*  results by, you know, forcing yourself to do that.
*  And that strength should be thought of as a skill.
*  And the way to practice skills is to not be tired.
*  And so when you do kettlebells, like I I follow these principles.
*  So say if I'm doing clean and presses with 70 pounds,
*  I could probably do 25 reps
*  if I wanted to get to failure, if I really want to get to like the last.
*  We're like, hmm.
*  So I don't do that. I do 10.
*  And at 10, I'm fine.
*  I could totally keep going.
*  But I put it down and then I walk away.
*  And then it looks like I'm lazy because I'll just like watch TV.
*  I'll watch a fight on TV.
*  And I won't do a thing for five minutes.
*  So in between my sets, I'm not the guy that like
*  unless I'm doing endurance training, I'm not the guy that like
*  goes through these sets like, all right, let's go next one. Push it.
*  I don't do any of that.
*  And I've gotten significantly stronger.
*  I just wait a long time in between sets and my workouts.
*  Like my kettlebell workouts might take two and a half hours.
*  So I'm lifting weights for two and a half hours.
*  But in between, I'm drinking electrolyte filled water.
*  I'm taking I take this
*  alpha brain pre workout that has beta alanine in it.
*  A lot of different things.
*  I drink that stuff and I get all the reps in that I would
*  if I just burnt myself out by sandwiching them together.
*  But I'm doing it in a point where I'm doing like my third set of 10 reps.
*  I'm not tired.
*  I can do that third set, no problem.
*  And I put it down and then I go to my next exercise.
*  And I follow the same protocol for my next exercise.
*  So whatever that is, whether it's renegade rows, same thing.
*  I don't go to failure.
*  I get like whatever the rep number is, whatever the weight it is over time.
*  I figured it out.
*  And then I take a big break, big break, five minutes,
*  10 minutes even, maybe sometimes if I really want to like for the last set,
*  I really want to be fresh.
*  And then when I'm hitting these, I'm not fatigued.
*  And it's decreased my soreness substantially.
*  It is allowed me to get all the repetitions that I would get in a shorter workout.
*  But I'm never in a point of fatigue where I'm having a difficulty controlling the weight.
*  And I think the Russians use this strength training method,
*  you know, a long time ago, and they've they've realized that this idea of like
*  trained smarter, not harder.
*  Now, is this optimizing for strength or hypertrophy?
*  Strength, strength, primarily strength.
*  Yeah. I mean, hypertrophy, a lot of times like bodybuilders, if you've you ever observe,
*  they'll do really light weight and extremely high repetitions,
*  like a hundred curls with like 15 pounds,
*  you know, because they're just trying to blow out those muscle fibers.
*  But I don't necessarily think that contributes to strength
*  the same way lifting things that are heavier does.
*  Yeah. I mean, I've always heard that lower on the rep range,
*  you know, as opposed to higher in the rep range, tends to promote more strength.
*  And then hypertrophy, you can achieve across the rep range.
*  Right. Now, yeah, I think we we now understand.
*  But I wonder how it reconciles because for hypertrophy,
*  I've never I've never been all that strong.
*  And so my workouts have been, you know, I've primarily focused on hypertrophy.
*  But I've always thought that while you don't necessarily need to go to failure on every set,
*  you do want to get close to it and maybe even hitting failure,
*  you know, on the last set seems to promote good gains in terms,
*  at least in terms of muscle growth.
*  Yeah. Maybe if you want to get jacked.
*  I just want to be strong. Yeah.
*  And I want also to be strong functionally.
*  I don't do anything in isolation.
*  I don't have any isolation exercises.
*  Not not a single one that I do.
*  No preacher curls. No nothing.
*  Everything that I do involves the whole body.
*  Are you familiar with this concept of stretch,
*  mediated hypertrophy that people have been talking about?
*  I am. But explain to people.
*  It's super interesting.
*  So obviously, you know, working through the entire rep range of a movement is beneficial
*  and should, I think, generally be the default.
*  But my understanding is that when the muscle is in its,
*  you know, most lengthened position under load,
*  you seem to get a lot of bang for your buck.
*  And that's where the benefits of
*  lengthened partials comes into play,
*  but also really kind of emphasizing that stretched position of any
*  move, you know, of any exercise, whether it's like the bicep curl
*  or the chest fly or even the chest press, you know, making sure that
*  you're really stretching out that that muscle
*  seems to there seems to be a lot of reward to be gained from that.
*  You know, whereas opposed, I think like what's
*  maybe what's what's most interesting about it is that we tend to think of
*  most of the gains being achieved when fully contracted, you know,
*  like we squeeze the full contracted position, for example, of the chest fly.
*  Whereas I think what this research is starting to suggest is that you actually
*  get more benefit from like that stretched position.
*  So really emphasizing that and making sure that you're really
*  as opposed to kind of just doing like this, like partial range of motion,
*  like really kind of extending out and carrying that kind of philosophy
*  to, you know, on through, you know, every lift.
*  I think there are some there's some thinking that, you know,
*  when you're like certain certain exercises, there might be some risk,
*  you know, incurred with that, like, for example, preacher curls, for example.
*  Like I've seen some like horror story videos on Instagram where people
*  snap their biceps, you know.
*  But just generally speaking,
*  that that's sort of like a big buzz thing now within the fitness
*  community, the stretch, stretch, mediated hypertrophy,
*  which is which is interesting.
*  It kind of makes sense because it's kind of the most vulnerable time of the lift
*  is like, especially if you have a chest fly in your back.
*  This you feel so vulnerable.
*  Whereas like here, you feel pretty strong.
*  Like once you have achieved like a certain amount of distance,
*  pulling the cables, you get to here and now you feel pretty strong.
*  And then at the end of it, you know,
*  you really feel vulnerable in the beginning.
*  In the beginning, everything feels like I got to get past this
*  where it's enjoyable and it's kind of enjoyable in this rep range,
*  like as you're bringing the hands together. Yeah. Yeah.
*  I mean, I'm not I'm not definitely not like an expert on the topic,
*  but I'm a student of of it, of fitness science.
*  And and I've put it into practice and I've seen some pretty significant gains
*  as a as a result.
*  You know, it's it's it is interesting.
*  But primarily, you know, you generally want to stick
*  complete the full range of motion, but then just maybe throwing in
*  some length and partials or
*  just a few extra reps at the bottom.
*  Yeah, you can go past failure, you know,
*  adding more volume always seems to be helpful from the standpoint of hypertrophy,
*  provided you're not adding junk volume, you're not just building fatigue.
*  You're actually adding stimulus.
*  Seems effective. I think that's one of the biggest mistakes
*  of people making the gym is that they don't train with adequate intensity.
*  I see a lot of people in my gym.
*  They're lifting weights.
*  And they I see them putting the weight down,
*  but when they clearly had, you know, five, six additional reps in the tank
*  and they're not lifting weight, that's all that heavy compared to how you
*  describe your new lifting style.
*  They're kind of just going through the motions of the exercise.
*  Not actually sending that the adequate stimulus to the muscle
*  that it needs to adapt, grow stronger or going to die.
*  And then they wonder why they don't get any results. Exactly.
*  They're half asking it. Yeah.
*  Well, as well, a lot of people do with everything in life.
*  Yeah. You know, unfortunately, and you pay for that,
*  whether you realize it or not, what you don't pay in the gym,
*  you pay for with the rest of your life.
*  Yeah, 100 percent. Yeah.
*  So true. Anything else, Max, you want to bring up while we're here?
*  Oh, man. I'm just super psyched to.
*  Yeah, to be here, to get to do what I do, to, you know, share.
*  Evidence based research with people,
*  but in a way that's practical and that acknowledges the limitations
*  of the research that I share and just the general landscape
*  of nutrition science, which tends to be incredibly weak.
*  I think that's not
*  often acknowledged that a lot of our,
*  you know, nutrition studies are incredibly weak,
*  you know, built on epidemiology, which has many flaws or not flaws.
*  It's good for what it's meant to do.
*  But I think we tend to overinterpret it.
*  And we use it to influence others, which I think is not smart.
*  Borderline unethical.
*  And so, yeah, and so far as I get to provide a,
*  you know, a more authentic, high integrity.
*  Highly actionable path for people.
*  Yeah, I'm just I'm just grateful that I get to do what I do.
*  And I do it on my podcast, The Genius Life.
*  And I'm super excited for people to watch the film,
*  which I've worked on for the past 10 years.
*  And again, I think it's the most important thing I've ever done.
*  And I'm super proud of it and.
*  Grateful to be here.
*  So thanks for I'm grateful to have you.
*  You are a really important resource, and I think it's
*  it's a great pleasure to have people like you available to,
*  you know, to provide free information for people to learn about all
*  these different ways that they can benefit their health.
*  And, you know, it's just so important to have someone like yourself out there
*  that really focuses on it and does a great job of disseminating that information.
*  Thank you, brother. Appreciate you very much.
