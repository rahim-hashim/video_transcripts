# Joe Rogan Experience #2202 - Tom Segura
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [September 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IitdaHy6Q8)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day.
*  Yeah, I've watched so many people get their legs broken.
*  Yeah.
*  And I see it in like jujitsu videos all the time where someone's like going for a heel
*  hook and then you hear this crack and the guy screams in agony and then everybody's
*  like, oh, this is horrible.
*  Yeah.
*  And in the arm, there's the million arm wrestling videos.
*  Oh, I saw a guy and a girl arm wrestling and the guy broke the girl's arm.
*  I'm like, what the fuck, man?
*  I was just like, how does that?
*  Because I don't want to do it ever again, really.
*  Arm wrestling?
*  No, I think it's stupid.
*  But like for me to get involved in.
*  But like even when I'm just like, well, why is this happening?
*  And there was two, these two competitors, like pro arm wrestlers, were like, well, you
*  never want to get away from your body.
*  So they're like arms break once they're out here.
*  So you always keep your arm in tight.
*  Arms don't break when you're here.
*  Right.
*  But once you get extension, they're like, that's when it's the dumbest macho thing that
*  we do for sure.
*  I did it with you in Louisville.
*  Do you remember?
*  No, it was a horrifying experience.
*  It was it was after we did a show in Louisville at the club.
*  It was tied to a UFC.
*  OK, one of those back in the day.
*  And we went to a bar afterwards.
*  We're shooting pool.
*  Somebody said arm wrestling.
*  I was like, and you like, you want to do it?
*  Sure.
*  I did.
*  I couldn't believe how strong you were.
*  I mean, I know you're strong, but I was like, you're like, go.
*  And I was like, I am going to like I couldn't get any fucking movement.
*  Well, you're a fucking dude that works for you.
*  That was the most that was hilarious.
*  That was.
*  Do you think he just does that because he just wants attention?
*  No, I think I mean, there might be a little bit of that, but I really think that's any.
*  He has this thing.
*  I was probably just, you know, it's it's it's part of his wiring.
*  It's probably gotten him somewhere in life in some ways where he just goes delusional,
*  being delusional about I can't lose.
*  Like if I if somebody says I can beat you like they can't beat me.
*  You're like, what are you talking about?
*  And then when you were pulling up, I was like, why don't you fucking ask him?
*  Because I already knew what was going to happen.
*  And then he also loves to gamble.
*  I was like, yeah, I'll take that action.
*  So, yeah, that's any.
*  And yeah, he but he's not even a strong guy.
*  That's why I was so confused.
*  I was looking at him like you want to arm wrestle.
*  Like, you're not even a strong guy.
*  Like, you don't like it's probably a lot of things you could do better than me with this one.
*  This one you got.
*  This is silly.
*  It is funny how our capacity for delusion is just incredible.
*  It can serve you well if you get lucky.
*  Right. Yeah, I think the two things I think about one of my friends was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer.
*  And he found out at stage four.
*  Right. Like had to go to the hospital because his wife was like, you're fucking sweating and you're, you know, heavy breathing.
*  It was after one of my shows.
*  And so they go and then the next day they're like stage four lung cancer.
*  And all the doctors were like, you know, say goodbye to your friend, you know.
*  And his brother found a the expert like in this specific type of because, you know, there's in oncology like a like really specialized types of cancer and treatment.
*  And I remember talking to him and he was like, you know, I'm going to beat this thing.
*  And I was looking at him and I was like, like, you're so stupid.
*  You know, like, like you're definitely going to die.
*  And but the thing is, I saw that he believed it a thousand percent believed it.
*  Yeah. And as he got better, I was like, this guy's fucking delusion is serving him in this.
*  Like I think most people like I remember when my uncle got a mesothelioma and he was like a high level urologist, the Mayo Clinic.
*  And I remember when I was talking to my dad about it, he was like, yeah, he's too he's too smart to he can read the labs.
*  He knows what he has. Like he he's too smart to go like, I'm going to beat this thing.
*  You know what I mean? Like you're just so well versed.
*  But is it a delusional thing or has that guy had other success in life because he's just super determined?
*  I mean, he's certainly a determined guy and successful in what he does.
*  But what's up, big head Steve?
*  Yo, big head Steve.
*  But I really was like, I credited this guy's like it felt like a level of delusion to believe you were going to survive.
*  But if he's correct and he was correct, it's not delusional.
*  Correct. Correct. Yes.
*  Right.
*  It's kind of crazy. It is kind of crazy.
*  The doctors are like, you're dead. And what if he just decides I'm dead and he starts freaking out or maybe he goes to Oregon and gets assisted suicide.
*  And so many people go down that path.
*  Yeah.
*  But you're right. They're whacking people left and right up in Canada.
*  Yeah.
*  You're depressed. You're not feeling good. Come on in.
*  Sign up.
*  Fucking sign up for the program. We'll get rid of you.
*  Where else is that?
*  They'll just kill you.
*  In Europe, in the Netherlands, don't they do that? Somewhere else.
*  I don't know. I'm sure. I'm sure it's other countries.
*  But it's a recent thing in Canada where they're just whacking people.
*  I didn't know they were doing that.
*  Yeah. Google it. Google it.
*  Because this is something you'll actually find on Google.
*  It's like assisted suicide in Canada.
*  The other delusion that I because I just watched the Scott Peterson.
*  Is that the Lacey Peterson?
*  So is that one is the new one where people are saying maybe he didn't kill her?
*  No, it's essentially it's fantastic.
*  It's on Netflix. I think it's a three part docu-series.
*  And it begins with you know, it's like this reminder.
*  It was 20 years ago.
*  Right.
*  You know, time just you're like, oh shit.
*  What was that story? How did that one?
*  So that one.
*  Canada's controversial medically assisted death program is fastest growing in the world.
*  Since suicide became legal in Canada, the number of deaths have grown each year.
*  So this is August. So this is just last month.
*  So what is it saying in terms of the numbers?
*  They've most recent data shows 13,241 people in 2022.
*  Wow.
*  That's quite a jump, bro.
*  So 2022 is 13,000.
*  Who knows what 2023 and 2024 is?
*  Oh, man.
*  They're whacking people up there.
*  That's pretty wild.
*  Come on in.
*  Come in.
*  Come on.
*  We get foot hurt.
*  My leg hurts.
*  I just said get in here.
*  Fuck life.
*  Yeah.
*  Fuck life.
*  That's a great tap out fucking option.
*  It's great.
*  I mean, what is this?
*  Is this like, I mean, is it a kind of eugenics?
*  Like, what is it?
*  What is it?
*  I mean, you could say it's being compassionate.
*  And in some cases, like Michael Lehr, you know, he went to Oregon.
*  Yes.
*  But Michael Lehr was his body was failing so horribly he couldn't talk anymore.
*  That was ALS?
*  Yes.
*  It was not the same thing that was ravaged that.
*  What was the famous woman that it was a huge international case here?
*  Do you remember?
*  I'm sure.
*  Terry Shivo.
*  Terry Shivo?
*  Was it Terry Shivo?
*  I don't know if she had the same thing.
*  But she had this horrible, debilitating disease.
*  Yeah.
*  And you're still alive.
*  And at the end, he like, it kept getting worse and worse and wasn't getting better.
*  So he went to Oregon to do it.
*  He actually went to Oregon once and then changed his mind and came back.
*  And when you sign up for that in Canada, can you just go like, that's just what I want?
*  It doesn't matter?
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know what the rules are.
*  But I know that some people are very upset about it because you're taking people that
*  maybe you could talk them off the ledge.
*  Maybe they could have got better.
*  Maybe with some love and some friendship and some counseling and some therapy.
*  That they wouldn't take that option.
*  Yeah.
*  Maybe they'd be happy.
*  Yeah.
*  I've met, I've known quite a few people that have taken their own life.
*  Yeah, I know a few that have done it too.
*  And it's always super sad.
*  I mean, because I don't know anybody that's done it, with the exception of Michael.
*  I don't know anybody that's done it in the case of a...
*  Like a medically assisted?
*  No.
*  No, Michael's the only one that I know about that.
*  But there's Brody.
*  Brody was a hard one.
*  There's my friend Tony, who's a pool player up in San Francisco.
*  He jumped off the bridge.
*  Which is crazy that there's a spot where everybody goes.
*  Yeah, one of my college, when I had jobs, I worked, when I was in college I worked the
*  whole time.
*  I had part-time jobs.
*  And then one of my coworkers did.
*  It was fucking terrible, man.
*  And like our boss went to his apartment and found him there.
*  It was terrible.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, for some people, they don't think it's ever going to get better.
*  I know.
*  And, you know, and if you don't have support around you, you don't have someone that can
*  pick you up.
*  And it's crazy how someone can pick you up.
*  It's crazy how you could be just feeling like total complete shit.
*  And someone who cares about you can come over to your house, take you out, have some
*  laughs.
*  Yeah.
*  And you're like, I think I feel better.
*  Yeah.
*  We feel better around people.
*  Some people are super isolated, too.
*  That's the dangerous one.
*  And I think one of the things I realized as I got older is you don't realize how many
*  people are lonely in this world.
*  Right.
*  Like you get older, I'm saying, because you encounter more people.
*  And you talk to people who, like you realize you have this like full life that you can
*  take for granted.
*  Like you have a family, you have friends, you have all these things going on.
*  And then you meet people who they don't have any of that.
*  And they're alone.
*  There's a lot of those out there right now.
*  And that's a lot of people that are very lonely.
*  Well, there's also this internet culture, too, right?
*  So there's people that don't have actual physical contact with anyone.
*  So all their interaction is with people online.
*  That's a dark place, too.
*  They're streaming all day and chatting all day on Instagram and jerking off.
*  And it's madness.
*  Mm hmm.
*  Yeah, that's not that's not a path to fulfillment is isolated online.
*  No.
*  And also you don't sometimes I don't have it to that degree, but you're you're online
*  for a while on something.
*  And then you go into the real world and you're like, oh, yeah, I'm like, I was just living
*  in this make believe place.
*  Right.
*  I didn't realize it's not real.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  You live in this make believe place and you're not having any of the normal human contact
*  that we thrive on.
*  Right.
*  All your contact is like this weird, like displaced, not connected.
*  It's all weird.
*  Mm hmm.
*  Which is like if you go to someone's Twitter profile and you see that they're online 12
*  hours a day just fucking barking at people like a dog.
*  It's giving them some charge.
*  Yeah.
*  Annoying dog next door.
*  Just baiting people all day.

*  Let me tell you, before I say anything, I just want to say, whoever's helping her, whoever's
*  coaching her, whoever's the puppet master running the strings, you get a free free free
*  Yeah, you get a fucking amazing job.
*  She's a great job.
*  They did an amazing job from the moment Biden drops out, forcing Biden to drop out, right?
*  Whatever they're doing, whoever's writing those speeches, getting her to deliver them,
*  coaching her.
*  She's nailing it.
*  She nailed that one speech.
*  She's like, say it to my face.
*  She nailed it, dude.
*  And then last night, to me, when I was like, oh my God, this is Jiu Jitsu, where she was
*  like, if you go to his rallies, his crowds are boring.
*  They're tired.
*  They all leave early.
*  My crowds are the best crowds.
*  I have the number one crowd.
*  He couldn't help himself.
*  And she got him.
*  She baited him on that.
*  She walked him right into it.
*  100%.
*  100%.
*  So the difference in that debate was not a difference in like, who's going to have better
*  policies, who's going to be better for the country.
*  The difference in the debate, in my opinion, was who was better prepared.
*  She was way better prepared.
*  And even when it came to answering tough questions, instead of answering, she would just say things
*  that she believes.
*  Yes, sure.
*  And they sounded real good.
*  And that's the sound bite.
*  That's called being a savvy politician.
*  It's also called being someone who's working with a team versus someone who's like, they
*  said Trump, that deal was the best deal.
*  They've never seen a deal like this before.
*  They said, how did you put that deal together?
*  People thought that was just brilliant.
*  Yeah, I know.
*  He's not working with a team that's like, I mean, I know he's doing mock debates.
*  I know he did one with Tulsi Gabbard.
*  But someone needs to tell him, you've got these tiny little windows, and you should
*  have all the words ready for those windows.
*  There should be no repeating things.
*  Yeah, he started out strong.
*  Because out of the gate, everybody can't help but get in their own way who they are, right?
*  And for him, it's like, OK, don't get fucking crazy.
*  Like, I'm sure, you know, like, wild shit.
*  They'll say people are eating cats and dogs.
*  And, you know, they're fucking coming in here eating all our pets.
*  And, you know, you just watch them.
*  You're like, you're watching this thing.
*  You're like, what?
*  It's just fucking insane.
*  And then for her, they're just basically like, don't laugh like a stripper.
*  Like how you every time you come to a podium, you're like, yeah.
*  Well, that's a panic.
*  Fucking calm down.
*  It's a it's a move that, like, comics will do with their material is not that good.
*  They laugh at it.
*  They laugh through it.
*  Exactly.
*  But then you remember, you know, this is somebody like take away your politics or whatever you
*  believe.
*  This is a former prosecutor.
*  It is a it's a trainable person.
*  Yes.
*  Right.
*  If you're a prosecutor, you can you can get the information and regurgitate it.
*  She's not dumb.
*  By any stretch.
*  See, people want to say she's dumb because she's not good off the cuff when pressures
*  on her.
*  But you don't understand what that kind of pressures like, like the kind of pressure
*  that that lady has been under for the last.
*  Let's think about the pressure she's been under for the last four years being vice president.
*  Everybody hates her.
*  Yeah.
*  She a lot of gaffes, a lot of dumb things.
*  So every time she's saying something in the back of her head, she's like, don't fuck this
*  up.
*  Yeah.
*  They're going to come for you.
*  They're going to use this against you.
*  Don't say, did you just fall out of a coconut tree?
*  Don't say that one again.
*  Yeah.
*  You know what I mean?
*  It's like, so there's that kind of pressure.
*  So a lot of pressure.
*  Very hard off the cuff.
*  But when you give her time and prepare her like last night, it's a good showing for her,
*  for sure.
*  Very, very good showing.
*  And unfortunately for him, like the thing that he does that it's just like he can do
*  it better than anybody alive is just riff.
*  He can go out there and have a crowd of people and just and he's funny, man.
*  He does things about like he did an Elon impression the other day.
*  It was hilarious.
*  He's very funny.
*  He's killing people.
*  He kills like a comedian.
*  Who don't like the guy still will have to acknowledge that he's funny.
*  He's funny.
*  He's funny like a comic.
*  You know, it's just like we don't necessarily want that as the guy with his finger on the
*  button.
*  That's all it is.
*  Sure.
*  That's the thing that freaks people out.
*  But the policies that he had when he was the thing is everyone's saying he's going to be
*  a dictator.
*  Well, he wasn't a dictator.
*  He was the president.
*  He actually was the president for four years and the economy really did well.
*  And he really did try to cut some of the bullshit down that's going on in this country.
*  And who knows what would have happened if he had four more years.
*  Maybe we would have been economically better off even if you don't like that one person
*  to be like the figurehead of the country that you identify with because you live here.
*  You don't want to identify with this guy that you think is blustery and you know.
*  Well, the thing is he's going to you know, we have like 55 days or something.
*  And the thing that's really going to happen now is you I think he realizes when she first
*  was announced, I'm sure most people, myself included, were like this is he's just going
*  to destroy her.
*  Right.
*  I think she was even going to have a chance.
*  But now you realize this is going to be, I believe, a much closer race.
*  It's close as fuck.
*  It's probably she's probably ahead now.
*  What is the latest?
*  I saw the Fox News poll.
*  It's hilarious.
*  90 percent Trump won.
*  They're eating cats.
*  I saw.
*  I saw on Facebook.
*  Killing newborn babies.
*  By the way, I think they are eating cats.
*  Yeah.
*  I think you get a bunch of poor people that are from an island where they occasionally
*  eat cats.
*  Yeah.
*  And you throw them in a city where there's 50,000 people, you throw 20,000 people in
*  there and there's ducks at the pond.
*  I'm going to go get a duck if I'm hungry.
*  My fucking son took one out of there.
*  So I grabbed it by the neck.
*  So yeah, I would not not believe a dude.
*  If I was starving, if I just came from another country and there's ducks laying around, I
*  grab a duck.
*  Sure.
*  That's not their fault.
*  Like how the fuck did they get here?
*  How did you get 20,000 shipped to one town?
*  Like what is that?
*  What's the real story behind that?
*  Is that organized?
*  The immigration issue is a legit real issue in this country.
*  It's in our state predominantly too.
*  It's a lot of it here.
*  Yeah.
*  So I mean a lot of it in California, a lot of it in Arizona, but it's a real issue.
*  And look, you and I are both the products of immigration.
*  Immigration is fucking awesome.
*  But hey, maybe when they do stuff that's bad, you should put them in jail.
*  Maybe.
*  Hey, maybe you should use the same laws on them.
*  Hey, maybe we should check to see if they're murderers before they come across the board.
*  Yeah.
*  Hey, maybe.
*  I know.
*  Hey, maybe.
*  They just turned.
*  I mean, this current administration just was like, oh yeah, we should just recently.
*  Do you think that recently I think it's they're also flying people in, which is crazy.
*  But recently, I think it's because they want people that are on the fence.
*  You know, the people that are on the fence, because this is not all that plays to all
*  that matters.
*  But once they're in again, if they're in again, they'll probably do the same thing.
*  Because what you're doing is you're essentially changing states that are swing states into
*  blue.
*  Because if you're going to give these people money, debit cards and food stamps and and
*  let them come in and even they're even talking about gender reassignment surgeries.
*  Yeah, I heard this.
*  Yeah, I don't know if that's true.
*  I don't know if that's true.
*  Because that that's part of the problem with this whole people are eating cats.
*  It's like you don't fucking know what's true anymore.
*  That's amazing.
*  Maybe you just read things on the Internet or you hear things on the radio.
*  Who fucking knows what's true?
*  Which is why like because a lot of people were also talking about the moderators interjecting
*  a bunch.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  But like part of that, I mean, feels like you kind of need some of that interjecting
*  because otherwise things are just said and you have zero idea.
*  100 percent.
*  A big one to me of like you.
*  This is why you need to have somebody interject at times is when he said to her like you went
*  negotiated with Zelensky and Putin.
*  And then and then just moves on.
*  Well, if you're a regular person at home, you know, you work and you take care of your
*  family.
*  You don't know the ins and outs of diplomacy and what's happening internationally.
*  You hear that you just go, oh, I didn't know that.
*  So you kind of have to have somebody go, wait a minute, you didn't negotiate with Putin.
*  You never met him.
*  Right.
*  And then Harris told ACLU in 2019 she supports cuts of two I.C.
*  I.C.E. funding and providing gender transition surgery to detain migrants.
*  That is crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  And also that is that's just September 9th.
*  She's going to do what politicians do, which she's in the midst of this right now, which
*  is just going, yeah, I've changed on that.
*  She did it like five times last night alone.
*  Like didn't you say that?
*  She's like, yeah, I changed.
*  I'm now in this.
*  Like, well, that's a good thing.
*  People can change this idea of flip flopping when you learn more information.
*  No, stick to your guns.
*  No, no.
*  Stupid shit you first believe in.
*  You can evolve and stay that forever.
*  Yeah.
*  That's dumb.
*  Yeah.
*  You definitely could evolve and you could be wrong.
*  And that's part of being a good leader is recognizing you're wrong and correcting your
*  course.
*  That's all good.
*  What is going on with the earrings?
*  The earrings?
*  Do you know about this?
*  The earring controversy?
*  No.
*  No.
*  OK.
*  I can't believe that what she was wearing last night was the type of earring that they
*  use for it's like an it's an earpiece.
*  Like you can talk through it.
*  No.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  So someone can talk to her.
*  Someone can coach her.
*  They have better ear pieces.
*  Well, no, Jamie, they want one that looks like a fucking earring so you can just wear
*  it.
*  Duh.
*  Like if you have one that looks like an earpiece, like, oh, like if Trump had one right through
*  the bullet hole, this this is definitely going to take off if they're already saying this.
*  Yeah.
*  This is going on Twitter.
*  Oh, but here's the thing.
*  It does look exactly like the ones that they use for what they're called Nova earphones.
*  OK.
*  So there's a video.
*  I'll send you the video, Jamie.
*  But there's a video of this thing in action.
*  It's pretty fucking interesting because in the video they're just they're showing that
*  little earphones like it's a commercial and it's pretty cool.
*  Hmm.
*  Yeah.
*  So is the actual ear?
*  If you have the real thing, do you wear it as an earring?
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, wow.
*  Yeah, you wear it as an earring.
*  God damn it.
*  Did I save it?
*  I might have saved it on Twitter, not Instagram.
*  But it's do you find it?
*  There's a video.
*  It's kind of cool.
*  It's cool because I like all that spy espionage type shit.
*  Yeah, sure.
*  Interesting.
*  But if she really did do that, first of all, she didn't do that.
*  Bring those earrings.
*  Allow them to be investigated, please.
*  Sure.
*  Just the ones that you wore.
*  Just we'll trust you.
*  Take those like because you can't really get a pair made that aren't those.
*  Right.
*  If you have those like so this is what it looks like.
*  So there's a there's a different commercial that I saw.
*  It's pretty cool.
*  So like these are earrings, but they're actually earphones.
*  So like you listen to music, all kinds of shit.
*  Or you can have people give you instructions and say, hey, make fun of the crowds.
*  Now's the time.
*  Right.
*  Make fun of smile.
*  Smile.
*  He's talking about eating cats.
*  Don't get mad.
*  Put your hand on your chin.
*  Don't gaggle.
*  So these are actual earphones.
*  No, those are really cool.
*  Crazy.
*  Yeah, I did not realize that.
*  And so that's exactly what the ones look like that she was wearing.
*  Well, that'll be a new thing to run with.
*  Yeah.
*  Fun times.
*  These next 55 days are going to be.
*  Yeah, they're going to be bonkers, man.
*  I forgot.
*  I forgot how crazy it gets.
*  Just the energy and chaos.
*  Oh, my God.
*  Every time I go on Twitter, I get fucking anxiety.
*  I just send it to you, Jamie.
*  You can see the comparison side by side of the two of them.
*  Yeah, it's going to be it's going to be nutty, dude.
*  And then we get into November.
*  It's got oh, my fucking God.
*  Terrifying.
*  I'm just scared that someone's going to do something really stupid.
*  Yeah.
*  Some extremists on either side that really do believe you're going to take away the trans
*  kids or really do believe you're going to destroy the country from the inside.
*  So that's what it looks like.
*  OK.
*  Real fucking similar.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Real fucking similar.
*  I don't know.
*  You know, I don't know if that's what she's wearing.
*  She might have just been wearing earrings.
*  If they have the kind of technology like that for regular people and you could do that
*  and most people aren't aware of it, you can get it off because the ABC people aren't aware
*  of it.
*  Sure.
*  Snig it in, baby.
*  Yeah.
*  That'd be rad.
*  It's fun.
*  I'd respect it so much.
*  I'd be like, whatever you wherever you stand, politically left or right, you got to respect
*  what she did last night.
*  She got a great showing.
*  She did.
*  She did a great job.
*  But it just whoever's pulling the strings.
*  What a masterful job of propaganda they've done taking someone that they all agreed was
*  not a good vice president, was the least popular vice president.
*  Nobody even fucking knew anything about her.
*  Nothing.
*  Bro, everybody made fun of her.
*  Even like Joe Scarborough was talking about how she's like a problem for the ticket.
*  Sure.
*  And now you look and she's like neck and neck with him.
*  Is she ahead of him today?
*  The whole thing's so nuts, man.
*  But Taylor Swift's on her side.
*  Taylor Swift's on her side.
*  It's going to come down in these key states to just county by county.
*  It's going to be like, you know, where you're going to hour to hour, you're going to see
*  this county turn in and it's red and it goes up.
*  And then the blue county, it's really going to be in PA, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina,
*  Nevada, Arizona.
*  And then you got the mammalian balance.
*  Oh, yeah, yeah.
*  It's going to be crazy.
*  I still think it's so crazy that, you know, a lot of the developed world has Saturday
*  elections, you know?
*  Yeah.
*  It's where people are.
*  Yeah, you don't work.
*  Yeah, it's just fucking crazy.
*  It's ridiculous.
*  Most people have to work and also vote in person with a fucking ID.
*  We just got through three fucking years of you have to have a vaccine passport in order
*  to get food.
*  Right.
*  And you don't have to show your ID.
*  You have to be able to show an ID and show that you're vaccinated to get on an airplane.
*  We just got through that.
*  Yeah.
*  And now all of a sudden it's racist to say that you want voter ID.
*  No, I think it's insane that there's only one reason to do it that way.
*  There's two things that are going on simultaneously.
*  You're letting in literally millions of people, millions of people, and you're giving them
*  all these services for sure.
*  OK, whatever, however much there's all these talk, there's all this talk about they gave
*  the money and there was, you know, all these stories about people getting debit cards and
*  food stamps and all this money.
*  And then they're putting up in hotels in New York City and they're giving them free food.
*  And then there's people that are poor that live in America.
*  They're like, hey, why am I not getting that?
*  What's going on here?
*  And then you're not even allowed to have your vote.
*  They've already tricked you into voting specifically for this one party.
*  So now if you bring in millions and millions of people and then the same people that want
*  to bring these people in or that are allowing their policies, that are allowing these people
*  to come in are the same people that think voter ID is racist.
*  Like, you're racist saying voter ID is racist, by the way, because you're saying that these
*  people are too stupid to get a fucking driver's license.
*  Everybody has a goddamn driver's license.
*  Like, what are you saying?
*  I know.
*  What are you saying?
*  Like, voter ID is racist?
*  Yeah, our system is really fucked.
*  Crazy!
*  And so are like the county drawings that they do for districts, you know, the gerrymandering.
*  They're like, oh, and you look at the graph and it's just to engulf a part of a district
*  that doesn't make sense to include it in.
*  All this is manipulation.
*  Well, there's also how many seats is dependent upon how many people are in your county.
*  The more people you import into your county, the more you can change the demographics.
*  But these county lines make no sense half the time when you look at them, when you study
*  up the way that they're attributed.
*  You've got to fucking give the Democrats credit for the manipulation.
*  I mean, they did everything a lot.
*  Every time they've had a hurdle, like they moved Bernie off the fucking primaries, they
*  fucked him, you know, then it comes to the whole thing with RFK.
*  They fucked him.
*  Fuck you.
*  Fuck Tulsi.
*  Fuck you.
*  And what they've done, I mean, and right in front of everybody's face.
*  And yet all these people like, yay, save democracy.
*  Like, are you not seeing what's going on?
*  Are you not seeing like if the same people with the same ideas played fair, if the same
*  people with the same ideas played fair, we have a different thing.
*  We have a different thing.
*  We have a different thing.
*  And then we can get back to people disagreeing about policy, disagreeing about plans.
*  You seem like we're far from that, though.
*  We're so far from that.
*  We're so far from that that people don't even give a fuck about what the policy is.
*  They're just committed to their side and anything their side does that's kind of fucked up or
*  twisted or they'll gaslight you on it.
*  Then they'll say it's not that big of a deal.
*  And then they'll tell you it's good that that's happening.
*  Yeah, of course.
*  You fully justify it.
*  Somebody had a great tweet about the eating pets thing.
*  Here, let me read it.
*  It's one of those things where I just I read it and I'm just I'm so happy that we live
*  in a time of the Internet because the Internet is so fun because there's so many regular
*  people out there in the world that are so fun.
*  Yeah, they are.
*  So this dude's name is Nick Freitas and Green Beret combat veteran.
*  But look at his look at the sweet that I sent you, Jamie.
*  I can't believe this is a topic.
*  The left.
*  No one is eating people's pets, which means we're one week away from why do you care that
*  people are eating pets three weeks from why eating pets is a good thing?
*  Four weeks from refusing to eat pets is white supremacy.
*  No, he's got it.
*  He fucking nailed it.
*  He nailed it.
*  It's just like we live in such a mad, mad world.
*  Yeah.
*  And if you it's like this is entertaining to read this.
*  But also if you lose yourself in these like back and forth online, you lose your fucking
*  mind.
*  Oh, you lose your fucking mind.
*  And there's a lot of people who lose their mind.
*  It's just I don't engage in it.
*  I know you don't either.
*  It's a bad way to communicate with people.
*  It's a bad way.
*  It's bad for your health.
*  I really believe that.
*  I think it's bad for your mental health.
*  I 100% agree.
*  Yeah, I remember.
*  I don't know if he still does this.
*  And I've heard other people do this.
*  But I remember when DeStefano told me that he was like, like a year or so ago.
*  He's like, it's fucking with my happiness.
*  Yeah.
*  And then he gave somebody his log in stuff.
*  He's like, I don't want it.
*  I'll just send you things to post.
*  But I'm never going to I don't even have my own log in.
*  Ari did that for a while too.
*  Right before the Kobe thing.
*  He got back online and immediately went bad.
*  But it's not good for anybody.
*  And that's why I am absolutely addicted to looking at things on my phone.
*  I'm addicted to watching YouTube.
*  I'm addicted to stories, just looking at stories on Google and a lot of his nonsense, but a
*  super interesting science stuff.
*  There's a lot.
*  I get a lot of super interesting science stuff all day and people send me super interesting
*  stuff.
*  Productive stuff.
*  I try to not you and me.
*  I well you and me have a bad thing.
*  We have a bad thing.
*  You and me are text, which is what I was going to get to our text message chain is the fucking
*  worst thing on the Internet.
*  It's so dark.
*  People go, hey, because they hear about it and they go, include me and I go, we don't
*  ruin your fucking life.
*  You want your whole algorithm to be just the darkest.
*  Yeah, this is my Tommy's thing.
*  The darkest, the darkest things we find.
*  My algorithm is a confusing.
*  Oh yeah, it's a mess.
*  It's confusing.
*  It's dark, semi erotic and it's just the most peculiar.
*  There's also, I just can't help with all the censorship that has become, you know, it's
*  so prevalent.
*  It's one of the big topics of the last five years.
*  I still don't understand why I get to watch murders.
*  All day long.
*  I mean.
*  All day long.
*  I get to see on my Instagram executions, a lot of Russian car accidents and manufacturing
*  mishaps, like people getting electrocuted, hit by trains and then and straight up just
*  gun to the head.
*  Just like hit men.
*  I've seen on on closed circuit TV where you're like, this is cool.
*  But like, I don't know.
*  A girl's tit isn't.
*  And somebody, somebody leaving a comment that is like a misgendered.
*  So yeah, like the language is that person's account gets fucking banned.
*  But I can see this guy get his head fucking blown off.
*  Why?
*  It doesn't add up at all.
*  Well, that was why the old Twitter was weird because they had hardcore porn.
*  There was always hardcore pornography.
*  But if you misgendered someone, you'd be banned for life.
*  Yeah, that's so that doesn't add up at all.
*  It's always been this to this thing in America, like one of the big European versus American
*  differences is that, you know, we always had this this holier than thou reaction to the
*  naked body and just sex in general.
*  Right.
*  Like there's a topless person or a lovemaking scene and people are like, you know, either
*  this is NC 17 or, you know, right.
*  But we can have someone like a grenade in a guy's mouth and then fucking buy and they're
*  like, yeah, well, that's that's on fucking TNT today.
*  Well, how is how is it getting through Instagram filters?
*  I don't.
*  I asked you this like a couple of months ago because I'm not on TikTok.
*  I'm like, do you see that when you sent me something particularly disturbing, I was like,
*  OK, is this on TikTok, too?
*  I've seen crazy shit there as well.
*  I do know that the the the go around in on Instagram seems to be just in your caption.
*  So if you notice, if you look at the caption, a lot of time it's like 20, 24.
*  Mercedes Benz and that's an amazing off road vehicle because they figured out that the
*  whatever the sensors and the algorithm doesn't watch the video.
*  It's like your cat.
*  If you if you were to write, here is a guy getting hit by a truck.
*  Fucking head comes off your caption.
*  That thing would get taken down.
*  But if you're like, check out the new fucking 20, 24 MDX or whatever it's called.
*  Here's the question.
*  Where is the money?
*  How are they making money?
*  That's good. That's I don't know, because whoever is putting videos up, money.
*  Yeah, these are accounts from bots.
*  So if you look at the accounts, there's no real comments and real things that anybody's
*  saying with that account.
*  And then this account might have thousands of these videos.
*  Yeah. And and the war footage, the drone footage.
*  Oh, just like I saw one yesterday where this drone, a kamikaze drone, was coming after
*  these guys and they were shooting at it with AKs and they couldn't take it down.
*  The thing was evading the bullets.
*  And then finally it moved into the guy through his AK at it and it blew up.
*  It saved his life.
*  Really? He threw his fucking rifle at the drone as it was coming to because they they
*  dive on you and blow up.
*  I I think being able to see those, I will say this gives you like a very sobering perspective
*  on modern day war.
*  Because that's obviously, you know, that wasn't a thing in Vietnam or World War two.
*  You see it. But like the fact that you see these guys out in a field, you know, whatever
*  side they're on. I'm just talking about the reality of these human beings.
*  And then this fucking drone with a camera is chasing them down.
*  Yeah. And it can it can just blow it just.
*  Well, this is the first time that's ever happened.
*  And it's fucking the first time we've ever had drones that chase people.
*  Yeah, I'd never I mean, I'd seen obviously heard of and knew about drones that are like
*  basically satellites, you know, that like that fly.
*  I know they're like planes and they lock in on a on a location and fire a missile.
*  Right. But these little tiny ones that just, yeah, chase people and blow up.
*  I mean, they're suicide bombers.
*  Yeah. Yeah, it's really it's super disturbed.
*  Guys are going into the trenches with GoPros on.
*  Like I watched this one where this Russian guy killed these Ukrainian guys that were
*  in like they were in a trench and he's like got a GoPro on.
*  Crazy. And he guns these guys down when they're in the trench.
*  And one guy is like struggling for the rifle and then he fucking gets the barrel back
*  and blows his head off. And you're like, yo, yeah.
*  And it's all like five feet away, three feet away.
*  Like, fuck. And you see that.
*  And then they're like, do you want to make a prosciutto mozzarella sandwich next?
*  Like, that's my feet. And you're like, yeah, I think so.
*  Yeah. If you saw my feed, if I was like being arrested for being a serial killer
*  and they had a look at his social media, like, look at his algorithm.
*  Oh, yeah. Look at his algorithm.
*  Oh, I mean, Christina just all day.
*  She's just like, you're such a sick person.
*  She's like, look what you want. Look what you fill your head with.
*  I don't show my wife. I also go to.
*  Well, I go to bed and I always put on biographies like it's a war,
*  a serial killer, or it's a scripted show about a murder.
*  It's the only thing that like I like it engages.
*  I find enticing and exciting to watch are like either real stories
*  about horrible things or I like suspense.
*  You know, I like that genre.
*  So I just I'm always watching it.
*  Well, it's always interesting just psychologically to see like, what the fuck
*  were the you know, like you're watching something on Richard Ramirez
*  or something like that. Like, what was this guy like? Oh, yeah.
*  I just cannot watch those things at night.
*  If I watch them in the day, I can tolerate them.
*  But at night before I go to bed, it just gives me too much room for crazy thoughts.
*  Well, that's a apparently that's a healthier reaction than mine
*  because I watch it and I'm like night night and I just fucking go to bed.
*  I don't I can't watch things about war at night.
*  Yeah, war freaks me out the most because I'm always like, OK, before Pearl Harbor
*  or before 9 11, like no one knew that was going to happen.
*  Like, how do we not know?
*  How do we know that we're not in a situation right now
*  where we're just before something really fucked up happens?
*  And that gets me at night.
*  Yeah, I understand that.
*  I mean, and also the way that now because I've watched docs on those very things.
*  Recently, like the the latest one,
*  the latest Nazi one, because at some point I'm also like,
*  are they ever just going to be like, I think we've covered it with Hitler.
*  And never and never.
*  And then I watched the latest one that there was a Netflix release, and it was
*  absolutely phenomenal, like the best docu series I've ever seen done on the Nazis.
*  Yeah, it's it's like a six or eight part series.
*  I don't remember what it's called.
*  It came out a couple of months ago.
*  It's so fucking good.
*  You don't realize that they could go deeper
*  and really highlight things that you didn't know about.
*  It's just so educational. But.
*  Hitler and the Nazis, evil on trial is fucking so goddamn good.
*  I cannot tell you how good this is.
*  So is this colorized footage?
*  There's color footage.
*  There's they go between, you know, the like real footage,
*  like real historical footage, narration.
*  And it's just do they have dramatization as well?
*  Yes. And it's so high level.
*  It's so well done.
*  It just paints a picture in a way that that I don't think has really been done before.
*  It's it's it's just incredibly fascinating.
*  But yeah, I mean, I get that at night, too, because you kind of go like especially,
*  you know, I mean, it was highlighted, I think, even in the debate.
*  And so it is a very valid point.
*  Which is that you just don't know what's going to happen in any war.
*  But, you know, when you have Russia involved in this war,
*  you do have a country with thousands of nukes.
*  Yeah. Like, you just don't know.
*  Well, how he is deciding to play this, you don't know.
*  And he's a KGB guy who's a dictator.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Like the whole thing is mad.
*  It's crazy. And you just can do, you know,
*  you know, one little thing that for him, that's the line.
*  Yeah. You just don't know what that is.
*  Yeah. You don't know what that is.
*  And you don't know why why it's happening.
*  You know, you hear about NATO moving their arms closer to Russia.
*  And you and you know that there was a coup that was probably
*  facilitated by the United States in 2014.
*  And it's like, fuck, man, like all this monkeying with shit overseas
*  scares the fuck out of me.
*  Of course. Yeah.
*  Every day, there could be some new thing popping off somewhere in the world.
*  And you're like, that's another one that the the turning point, doc,
*  about the history of the Cold War.
*  And when you when you realize how the nuke programs evolved
*  and what was really going and like how in the 60s,
*  when we were, you know, Bay of Pigs and all that was happening,
*  we thought because they postured like we can fucking take you guys down, too.
*  And they we ended up discovering later that they had like seven bombs
*  and we had like 10,000 at the time. Oh, God.
*  But then seven's enough, though.
*  It's enough. But it's also like, you know,
*  you could also target these areas.
*  It's a it's a more you can deal with it.
*  But of course, they never showed that hand.
*  But then you see how in the into the 80s,
*  how their program just far exceeded.
*  All right. At one point, they had like triple what we had.
*  And also, these are an amount of bombs that doesn't even really matter.
*  If you have thirty three thousand nukes, it's like, you know,
*  what the fuck are you going to do? The world's over.
*  Yeah, it's over anyway.
*  But how we both operated on a sense that like, oh, yeah.
*  If either one of us crosses the line, it's just over for both of us.
*  Yeah. Mutually assured self-destruction. Yes.
*  And then the other thing was that during the Reagan administration,
*  they kind of like forced the Russians into trying to keep up with us
*  militarily, which kind of bankrupt the Soviet Union. Sure.
*  Because if you have a communist country, it's it's way harder to get money.
*  Yeah. Fucking you're not making anything.
*  You're not selling anything.
*  You're not ever. And so a lot of capital.
*  Things got really bad there economically, like massive
*  poverty and starvation. Yeah.
*  And while you're having massive military spending,
*  it's kind of unsustainable.
*  But then they've since recovered. Yeah.
*  And then them like China, like what's interesting, what China has done is
*  China has developed this sort of they have capitalism and communism,
*  which is the way to do it.
*  Like you get people motivated to make a lot of money, get industries, get huge.
*  But everything is completely tied into the government, which is like, oh, we nailed it.
*  Yeah. This is it. It's a good program.
*  It's a good program. Yeah. It's not good for the people.
*  Yeah. It's not good for us. It's good for running the show.
*  It's great for running the show. Yeah.
*  And that's, you know, that's this is what's scary about what's going on in this country.
*  Is there some people that have the notion that in order for us to compete
*  with these other countries, we have to govern people in a more similar way than they do.
*  They have to have more control over information, more control
*  over what people say and do more control over money.
*  You know, China now has centralized digital currency in some places, which is
*  that's very scary. Yeah.
*  Once once the government has complete access to your money
*  and be able to shut your money off or to like you saw what happened in Canada
*  with the truckers. Yeah.
*  So these people just donated money to this trucker protest.
*  That's all they did. Donate money.
*  And Canada shut their bank accounts down, which is that scary stuff.
*  It's very scary. That's banana republic shit.
*  And that's you could walk to Canada.
*  It's not that far to the you know, when the when we had the
*  what was it called? What's the company that they had the malfunction
*  and the airlines just stopped for a fucking day? Yeah.
*  My friends was bringing up how, you know, all these car manufacturers
*  have are starting are pledging, you know, will be fully electric by 20, 35,
*  or whatever. And I'm like, man, for me, I've just always been like,
*  you know, that that would suck just because I like cars.
*  Yeah. That are gas powered.
*  And, you know, I guess I'm a dinosaur in that way.
*  But no, they're cool. They're cool.
*  But what my friend was like, he was like, you know, he brought up that that
*  that malfunction.
*  He's like, you know, I just keep thinking about that if we were all electric,
*  that the government could also just go like, doop, like, oh, yeah.
*  Cars don't work.
*  Well, there's cars today that have on star on them
*  that the police can shut your car off. Yeah.
*  So if you're running a high speed chase with the cops
*  and you have some vehicle that has on star on it, they just hit a button.
*  Is that true? Make sure that's true.
*  That might be theoretical.
*  I think it's true, though. I think they could just shut your car off.
*  That's pretty scary.
*  So like if somebody and but they market to you like,
*  look, if someone steals your Corvette, Tom, you just call up
*  and they will have that car shut off. Sure.
*  And that person on the highway and it just pulls over for them. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Scary. Yeah.
*  Well, you know the story about Michael Hastings, right?
*  Michael Hastings was the reporter for Rolling Stone.
*  This is what they look for.
*  OK. So one vehicle can please use on start disabled car.
*  If the vehicle's parked and turned off, the on star advisor can use
*  remote ignition block to prevent the engine from being restarted.
*  Allowing the police to recover the vehicle so they can only do it once it's off.
*  What that says.
*  Um, can they OK, can please use on start to disable a car?
*  Click that search for below below that.
*  That part, click that, see if that gives you a different answer.
*  The vehicles parked and turned off. Same thing.
*  So can it shut off your car while you're driving?
*  Hold on to go back.
*  This is exactly what you're asking.
*  Disable engine and end high speed chases so it can.
*  Satellite technology that could disable an engine with a simple push of a button
*  helped end the high speed chase of a stolen sports utility vehicle
*  in the port, resulting in the arrest of Misha Wackaman.
*  And look at it says there.
*  Yeah, it was reaching 80 miles an hour before the on star technology slowed it to 20.
*  So it's just basically shut down.
*  So on star control this guy's car.
*  And they're looking at it like it's a good thing because it is a good thing,
*  because this guy is a crazy person, reckless driving, other counts,
*  resisting law enforcement, running from the cops.
*  But it's kind of crazy that they they could just press a button.
*  So maybe it's something that you didn't really do.
*  Maybe you're a whistleblower for some chemical company
*  that's done something that's illegal.
*  And then people don't want you to you're going to crash the stock market.
*  And, you know, you're on the run and they know he's on.
*  He's got the papers on him.
*  Find that fuck.
*  And they just, yeah, slow your Cadillac down.
*  Yeah. Spooky.
*  That's kind of spooky, man.
*  It's spooky because we know that people abuse power.
*  It's not spooky.
*  Look, if we had the our elected officials were all super enlightened beings
*  that were different than human beings and that only did things
*  according to ethics and rules and morals and and knew what was right and what was wrong.
*  Yeah. Yeah. OK.
*  Maybe then you can make a justification.
*  Yeah, but that's not our case.
*  That's not humans. That's not humans.
*  That all that stuff's crazy.
*  It's just you're giving too much power to people.
*  And then you could figure out a way to justify it.
*  So, yeah, what about those people that are running from the cops?
*  You're right. You're right. You're right.
*  But what about someone who's corrupt,
*  who's got a hold of that technology and they're tracking their ex-wife
*  because she's going to testify against them and they have her whacked?
*  Yeah, that shit happens, too.
*  For sure. It does. Or fucking sure.
*  And then if there's no record of it, if you just got some sort of computer
*  and you can just fucking slow down someone's car and then the hit man catches up to him,
*  guns are down or whatever.
*  Yeah, it's a it's a I mean, all technology can be abused.
*  100 percent. Yeah.
*  Well, we're seeing that with our with Google searches.
*  Nobody ever thought that you could just manipulate Google searches.
*  Yeah, but you 100 percent can.
*  I had Robert Epstein on the other day and he was explaining how it's done
*  and what they do and they're capturing all these ephemeral.
*  So like every time Google shows you stories or every time you Google something,
*  they record what Google shows.
*  And every time you Google something about Trump, it's going to show you all the negative.
*  You Google about Kamala Harris can show you all the positive.
*  And just by doing that for the casual voter, they can change the vote.
*  Yeah. By a significant percentage.
*  It's really it's insane.
*  And also the the listening thing, you know, not it's like
*  when I ran into a meta engineer when I was on the road at a hotel,
*  he was like, oh, I'm a fan.
*  And we just started talking.
*  And I was like, hey, because we had just talked with with the I was with my tour
*  crew about this is so fucking, you know, just the thing you keep going.
*  It's just so weird that we were having this conversation.
*  And yeah, it's right here.
*  Like it's a it's in my algorithm now.
*  And then also I'm getting emails about this.
*  Very strange, so strange.
*  And then we did like an experiment.
*  I was like, all right, let's just keep talking about Lamborghini's.
*  Like I like, just keep talking about them.
*  And we just kept talking about them in this conversation with our phones out.
*  And then, I don't know, two hours later, we were all sharing like,
*  look at my thing. It's just like my algorithm now has at Lamborghini's.
*  And I got an email about a Lamborghini.
*  I guess it's so and he goes, he goes, well, you know, we listen right.
*  And I go, well, yeah, I mean, I figure like I know that we've all kind of talk
*  about it, but like it's weird to have you confirm it.
*  Do you say they listen when the app is open?
*  He didn't we didn't it didn't go that far.
*  He was just like, well, you know, we listen to you.
*  Have you ever done an experiment where all your all your apps are closed
*  and you just start talking about something and see if Google picks that up?
*  Because that would be interesting.
*  We should do that right now. OK.
*  OK, what should we talk about?
*  Will be a good thing. Let's see.
*  Let me make sure that everything all my shit is closed.
*  I'm going to close everything.
*  Close.
*  What would be a good thing to talk about that would find out?
*  Let's go something that we don't ever look up.
*  Yeah, something that is not on our radar.
*  High school baseball.
*  High school baseball is definitely not something I'm interested in. Right.
*  And so you don't talk about high school baseball.
*  I never talk about high school.
*  High school baseball is so important because high school
*  baseball teaches you teamwork. It does.
*  And it teaches you how to perform together with friends.
*  You develop camaraderie. You learn how to compete.
*  And high school baseball really is that is the minor leagues of the minor leagues,
*  because if you thrive in high school baseball
*  and you're legit a good high school baseball player.
*  Yeah. Then you go to college.
*  You go to college and you can go in the minors and you could even next thing
*  you know, you're in the fucking Dodgers.
*  It's pretty crazy. And you're ballin and you're driving a Lamborghini
*  and you're driving a yellow Lamborghini.
*  OK, now let's see how much time you think it takes before.
*  I think it takes a little more. High school baseball.
*  I think I think you should.
*  I just want to bring up high school high school baseball, high school baseball.
*  I think high school baseball results.
*  And also, it's like when you think about high school baseball,
*  you realize that, you know, pitching at that level, you're not.
*  You're a real outlier if you get above 90 miles an hour,
*  because there's some high school kids that can pitch like 80, 85.
*  When you start getting high school kids pitching above 90,
*  you're talking about an elite level, a kid with a big old fella.
*  Long ass arms. Got that torque.
*  Yeah. Meet down that whip.
*  Those dudes can whip that ball.
*  So what is the fastest anyone's ever thrown a fastball?
*  That's a great question. I mean, it's let's guess.
*  Definitely. Oh, OK. That's a good guess.
*  And I definitely don't know.
*  I know the real baseball fans are going to be a fucking idiot.
*  But I'm going to guess.
*  One. 12. Is that crazy?
*  I was going to say 118. OK.
*  That's just a wild guess, though.
*  Is this going to be the what do you think it is, Jamie?
*  Do you know what it is?
*  Is this going to be the highest in a game or just the highest?
*  Highest ever. Like the fastest.
*  There must be like who's the fastest.
*  Because I bet the guy who's the best ever or fastest ever isn't the best.
*  Yeah, right. You know, not the most accurate.
*  Like it's just like in tennis.
*  Yeah. The craziest speed ever on a serve is not from right.
*  Federer. Right, right, right, right.
*  Like a guy with the hardest punch is not necessarily the best fighter.
*  Exactly. So what is let's take guess.
*  I mean, you got a good point.
*  So I was trying to really erase like in major league baseball from the search.
*  If I could, what's the fastest pitch ever thrown?
*  Fastest in major league baseball, it's 105.8.
*  What about in like the world record for the fastest ball ever thrown?
*  There's got to be competitions, right?
*  Like they have those golf competitions where dudes just drive that thousand percent.
*  Yeah. You could throw a fastball.
*  You would just be in the major leagues.
*  That's true. That's true.
*  You just figure out a way to get you over the plate.
*  You only have to do it like 10 times and you can make a lot of money.
*  So 105.5.
*  Yeah, there's a bunch of one guy has done it a bunch of times at 105
*  and a few people have joined him in the 105, but no one's cracked 106.
*  That must be so fast coming at you.
*  Terrifying. You ever look at the like from a umpire's perspective?
*  No, but I'm saying, I mean, that's it's.
*  But if you look at tennis, the high level serve speeds, what are their speeds?
*  We're talking like into the 130s.
*  Really? Yeah.
*  Like there's probably a guy who's probably done 140.
*  All right. I'm opening up Google to see if we get any high school baseball.
*  Come on, Google. Don't disappoint me.
*  163 for fastest.
*  What? What? Christ.
*  Fastest serve 163 block.
*  And John Eisner. Yeah, Eisner 610.
*  57. That's bananas.
*  610. So far, it's just wolves in MMA.
*  So I think you've got to give that about 30, 30 minutes to an hour.
*  And OK, what do I have?
*  I got chiropractors, Italian women's feet.
*  I got the debate.
*  I got upcoming fights.
*  I got some Canelo Alvarez, Connor,
*  sugar, Sean O'Malley and Marab, Duwabish Willie watches, watches.
*  Cybertruck. Baseball.
*  But you know, it'd be interesting, though.
*  Is you check back in an hour. Right.
*  Yeah, that's what I'm going to do.
*  I'm going to keep checking back for high school baseball.
*  And if high school baseball one house, I'm cheating because I got Google open.
*  I'm going to show that now. We'll see.
*  See if they get me. OK.
*  I should have been.
*  I should have come up with a product instead of high school baseball.
*  Prox, good idea. Like Lamborghini is a product.
*  They're going to try to sell you the product.
*  That would be a better move. There you go.
*  I should have had a product.
*  What would be the product?
*  But it has to. I want it to be a product that I wouldn't ordinarily search.
*  That's why I said high school baseball. Right.
*  Like, what's a product that I wouldn't search?
*  And you search humidor's?
*  No humidor's. That's a good one.
*  Cigar humidor. Cigar humidor. Yeah.
*  Cigar humidor's. What are the best ones?
*  Yeah. Cigar humidor's.
*  What's the difference? So many sizes.
*  Are there some that are too crazy and it's overkill and there's some.
*  What's the best wood for a cigar humidor?
*  One of my neighbors built a room.
*  He's not trying to get away from his wife.
*  He built like a store in his house. He's trying to hide.
*  He's trying to hide from his wife. It's awesome.
*  He's hiding. I love it.
*  It's fucking awesome. I don't want to do this anymore.
*  I mean, they just it's women repellent.
*  Yeah. It's so funny.
*  Yeah. No woman's ever like, hmm.
*  Yeah, they hate it. They think it stinks.
*  So funny. They hate it when it's outside.
*  Like, oh, that guy across the street's got a cigar.
*  So nice to start. You know what I did yesterday?
*  Oh, yeah. Sure.
*  I had a gummy, a mushroom gummy.
*  It was so good. Just a light one. Yeah.
*  Yeah. It was nice.
*  Shouldn't that be legal, Tommy Buns? Is it not?
*  I mean, it kind of is. Depends on the mushroom.
*  I take a lot of functional mushrooms over the last six months or something.
*  So I've been taking reiki and cordyceps and I got to get you one of these,
*  though, that I really good smooth. Very nice.
*  I'm also like
*  a bit naive as I haven't partaken that much before.
*  So I did mine like before bed.
*  Oh, no. And then I put like an eye mask on and I was like, ha, just looking.
*  Oh, yeah. I've seen all kinds of shit.
*  And then it's two thirty in the morning and I'm like, I got to take something else
*  so I can go to bed. Well, when I get riled up late at night,
*  I always feel like an idiot because I was like, I've just ruined my sleep.
*  Yeah, that's why I didn't late at night.
*  And I've got too many crazy ideas and start freaking me out.
*  It just ruins your sleep.
*  And the next thing you know, it's four o'clock in the morning.
*  You're on bed. It's fucked. It fucked me up.
*  I know it was just my own ignorance.
*  And then if you have a podcast the next day, you got baggy eyes.
*  You look like shit.
*  And your brain is not working so great.
*  Oh, by the way, one of the best supplements for performance,
*  mental performance when you are missing sleep is creatine.
*  Really? Like the workouts?
*  Yeah. Creatine, the workout supplement, it's really good for workouts,
*  but it's also really good for cognitive function.
*  Didn't know that. Yeah.
*  Well, if you think about it, what creatine does like Google,
*  what exactly creatine does, so I don't fuck this up.
*  But what I think it does essentially is it allows your body to hold on to more water.
*  Yeah. There's more water in the muscles.
*  So it increases muscle volume and it helps.
*  OK, here was creatine compound body naturally makes.
*  Get it from protein rich foods.
*  It supplies energy to your muscles and may also promote brain health.
*  Many people take creatine supplements to increase strength,
*  improve performance and help. What happened?
*  We'll just do. Yeah, we changed it. I was reading it.
*  OK, increase strength, improve performance.
*  And help keep their minds sharp. I've never heard this.
*  But the study, the recent study was the positive effects of creatine
*  on people that are sleep deprived.
*  It says an increased energy supply to neurons in the brain,
*  which may help with mood and thinking.
*  So it does something with water.
*  That makes you gain a little weight from it that I think you're storing more water.
*  So you have a bad night of sleep.
*  The next day. Yeah, but I take it every day anyway.
*  I've been taking it every day anyway for like the past six months.
*  Yeah, it makes a difference. It really does.
*  It makes a difference in your workouts.
*  But what I think I try to take as many things as possible
*  that are good for cognitive performance, you know, obviously, like doing a podcast.
*  You need that increased water. Here it is.
*  Creatine is an osmonically active substance.
*  Thus, any increase in the body's CR content, creating content,
*  should result in increased water retention and consequent gains in body mass.
*  Well, I knew about the water retention and that it was a verify to have like
*  it's one of the supplements that you can count on for gains.
*  Yes, it's I'd never heard about the brain.
*  Yeah, ever. Yeah, that's more recent.
*  They've been talking about that.
*  You know, it's been used as a muscle supplement since like the 90s
*  or been popular since the 90s.
*  Jamie, what does it say about because there was some sort of a study
*  about creatine supplementation
*  to enhance performance with sleep deprivation?
*  Because there was this study that was showing that, you know,
*  your cognitive performance when you just have like four or five hours sleep
*  drops off a cliff.
*  You know, I notice it in a thousand big way.
*  I'm just like it's 70 percent of like my normal.
*  A single high dose of creatine can temporarily improve
*  cognitive performance during sleep deprivation.
*  This is due to creatine's ability to prevent a drop in pH level,
*  improve processing speed, increase intercellular energy consumption
*  and increase high extracellular creatine availability.
*  Not awesome. That is so fucking cool.
*  Yeah, I really had no clue about this.
*  Yeah, I had a really poor night's sleep
*  like a month or so ago.
*  And I was going into my writer's room on my show.
*  And that's the like to me, like when you go, what's the worst things
*  about it when you have no when you have bad sleep or a physically
*  like your workouts suck like it's it's really rough.
*  Yeah, poor sleep.
*  But mentally to, you know, I hate doing a show.
*  Oh, yeah. Poor sleep.
*  And to go into a writer's room where you're supposed to be, you know,
*  fast creative. Yeah.
*  And yeah, we're talking about all the stories and
*  and I took a stimulant.
*  Dun dun dun. Holy shit.
*  It was like I slept fucking 12 hours.
*  I couldn't believe it. Which one did you take?
*  Vyvanse. Yeah.
*  Oh, nice. You like it?
*  Oh, my God. I was like, can I get some more?
*  The person was like, I'm not supposed to give you this.
*  This is amazing.
*  I think you have ADD or ADHD, whatever the fuck it is.
*  Confirmed. I think so.
*  But I couldn't.
*  I think we both have it.
*  We both need Vyvanse, whatever it is.
*  It's fucking awesome.
*  Isn't that the guy who's the vice president under Trump?
*  No, JD Vance.
*  Yeah. JD Vance, the creator of Vyvanse.
*  I couldn't believe, though, how.
*  The I mean, I was really dragging.
*  I was like on one of those.
*  I slept three to half, four hours.
*  Bam. I mean, firing on all cylinders.
*  Like it was like I had a great night's sleep.
*  Really? I could not.
*  What's the come down like?
*  Not that bad. Real?
*  No, it was.
*  Apparently that's one of the.
*  Don't tell me on this.
*  Don't do it.
*  The big differences between is that the crash from Adderall.
*  I never did Adderall. I never had it.
*  Like people talk about the post Adderall crash.
*  But the Vyvanse, I was like, yeah, I feel they got it.
*  Nailed. Yeah.
*  These motherfuckers.
*  They fucking nailed it. These motherfuckers.
*  And yeah.
*  You know, there's a lot of people out there
*  just turning and grinding all day.
*  You're on amphetamines.
*  That's what it is. Yeah.
*  Yeah, it's pretty incredible.
*  I can't believe I'm bringing it up again.
*  But that book over there, Blitzed, is a Norman Oehler book about the Nazis
*  during the Blitzkrieg campaign. They were all on meth.
*  All of them. Yeah.
*  And then, you know, a lot of people don't.
*  I talk about it on stage, but the people don't know that
*  Hitler was on a lot of cocaine, too.
*  Oh, Hitler was on a lot of oxycodone, too.
*  Yeah. But the coke part was always like, to me, the the thing that I was like,
*  wait, what? And it was his doctor that was getting it to him.
*  That's what that book's all about.
*  It's really fascinating how that whole the whole army was all methed out.
*  Oh, yeah. And they would give more meth to the people that were on the front lines.
*  Like the tank guys, they got the most meth.
*  Yeah. Just fucking meth them up.
*  Well, there's that makes sense.
*  People on meth. What is it?
*  People on.
*  People on meth love confrontation, you know, like they they are aggressive.
*  Yeah, they seek out confrontation.
*  So I remember I talked to Dr.
*  Drew one time, he goes, people on cocaine run from the cops
*  and people on meth run towards the cops. Really?
*  Yeah. So you get people like a really like serious coke problem.
*  They see a uniform and they bolt. Whoa.
*  And then people on meth, like when they're like,
*  when dealing with like real meth people, they see cops and they're like,
*  what's up, bitch?
*  Like they want confrontation with uniforms.
*  Like they just seek it out.
*  That's fucking what they do.
*  You see that football player get pulled over?
*  Yeah, man. That was fucking wild.
*  Yeah. Tyreek Hill. Yeah.
*  Yeah. On the way to the Dolphins game is interesting.
*  He just didn't want to roll his window down.
*  I know. And I understand like there's like a lot of people
*  weighing in on, you know, the nuances of this whole thing, because it's layered.
*  It's not. But it's like.
*  I mean, look, I'll never have Tyreek Hill's experience,
*  you know, like being a black guy in America and in a McLaren and
*  and I don't know what it's like to get pulled over by cops.
*  My whole thing with cops, if I get pulled over, I always try to be like
*  Yes, sir. Ten and two. Yes, sir.
*  Now, he like people are right.
*  It's not against the law to be to not be like that.
*  We're allowed to fucking to be like, whatever.
*  Hurry up and fucking figure this out. You can do that.
*  But I just feel like it's it's not deescalating things.
*  Right. But then those cops were fucking hot with like, you could tell.
*  The one in particular felt like to me watching it, that he was
*  he had felt maybe humiliated by also either somebody he recognized
*  or just somebody with wealth who is feeling entitled
*  that he wanted to show the other cops.
*  Yeah. That like, I don't take any shit, which I feel like it's a human emotion.
*  But then. Right. But you can't have that human emotion as a cop.
*  You can't. You can't act on it for sure.
*  You can't just fucking throw somebody.
*  Yeah. To the ground and cuff them as if they're a dangerous criminal.
*  I like it. He's like he was a violent offender.
*  It was really fucking nuts.
*  It is nuts. The whole thing's nuts.
*  It's not it's nuts. But it's also it's like it's nuts both ways.
*  Right. It's like roll the window down.
*  Just roll the window down is.
*  Say yes, sir. I don't know what.
*  Give your driver's license, your speeding.
*  You're going 103 miles an hour. What are they're alleging?
*  I don't know what what his issue was.
*  He just didn't feel like it. Fun car.
*  That's a fucking fun. That's a fun car.
*  Is that a 765? I don't know what it is.
*  I don't know anything about McLaren's, but it's fucking dope.
*  I know. I remember when you were racing in the car.
*  I know. I remember when you were reviewing one,
*  when you had that car thing you were doing for a while.
*  They were giving me I've driven a lot of the lineup.
*  I've driven the 600 LT.
*  How come you ever got one? I don't know.
*  I should get one.
*  I just drove the new 750 S.
*  It's fucking phenomenal.
*  But they're making cars that just a rich knucklehead can buy
*  that has the most insane speed and power.
*  I remember when they sent I specifically I've driven, like I said,
*  a lot of the lineup when I drove the 765 LT,
*  I remember talking to at the time he was with McLaren and F1, Daniel Ricardo.
*  And I was like, dude, I just drove this fucking thing.
*  And I've never I've I've been driven a lot of cars.
*  I've never been more scared of what could happen in a car.
*  You know, I was just I was driving down the 110.
*  And we were doing like 70.
*  And it was just open road.
*  And I had somebody in the passenger seat and he was like, punch it.
*  And I mean, in the blink of an eye, we're just we're going 130.
*  And it's just like it's so fast and so responsive, you know, the slightest input.
*  And I was like, this is this is a it was a it was a scary feeling where I go.
*  I want to hand this in like I want to turn this in right now.
*  And I also want to order one, you know, like the both things really.
*  I know this is bad for me. Yeah.
*  But can I get some more violence?
*  Because it's fucking pretty cool.
*  That's what it felt like it was.
*  It was terrifying and seductive.
*  But the conversation that I had with him, I was like, it's crazy
*  that you can just buy this. Yeah.
*  And have that there's no skill requirement associated.
*  And he and other automotive journalists were like, oh, yeah, you should definitely
*  have to prove something. Yeah.
*  To drive something like this.
*  Look at that thing. Yeah.
*  Or like think about the Corvette ZR1.
*  So that has an even lower bar to entry.
*  Right. That's like 200 grand. Right.
*  What's a ZR1? The new one?
*  I don't know. I don't know the price on that.
*  But that thing's insanity.
*  That's like 1100 horsepower. Right. Really crazy. Yeah.
*  Insane. Rear wheel drive car.
*  And all the manufacturers keep getting crazier and crazier and crazier.
*  And then you get to the electric stuff.
*  Yeah. It's also like it's a missile.
*  You know, 1064.
*  So it's almost 1100 horsepower.
*  Fucking bananas.
*  That's so much power for a car.
*  It used to be a car at 400 horsepower.
*  Like, I remember I got a Porsche turbo in like 2003
*  and it was 420 horsepower.
*  Like, this is crazy.
*  That's a bonkers number. It was crazy back then.
*  What does this go for?
*  Yeah. Just Google MSRP for ZR1.
*  You really can't get one.
*  You have to have an allocation, right?
*  There's probably.
*  Is that one? One for sale?
*  That's the three. 129.
*  Oh, it's no six.
*  Oh, that's a ZO6.
*  Yeah, ZO6 is pretty fucking incredible, too.
*  So that's 129. So there you go.
*  The ZR1. You're right. Yeah.
*  200 grand. $200,000 Corvette.
*  Well, others believe that it will start for much less than that.
*  Oh, so they haven't really got the price out there yet.
*  Wow. Yeah, that 765 is like 400.
*  It's expected to start.
*  400 grand. So crazy.
*  Well, then you got that Hennessy, that Venom thing.
*  That's three million bucks. Yeah.
*  So you get like conus eggs, Pagani.
*  Yeah. Have you seen that Bugatti that has all of its instrumentation
*  is all mechanical, like a beautiful watch.
*  And the steering wheel turns around the gauge cluster.
*  So the gauge cluster maintains in the center of the wheel.
*  And your steering wheel turns around it and it never moves.
*  No, it's fucking magnificent.
*  What is this in a Bugatti? Oh, wow.
*  I'm not even a Bugatti guy.
*  Bugatti to me is like, look at my dick.
*  That's Bugatti, you know.
*  But look at that fucking thing.
*  Yeah, no, they're sexy.
*  See if you can find the the gauge cluster,
*  because the gauge cluster is just complete insanity.
*  Scroll up towards the interior.
*  I know they have to show. There it is.
*  They're going to show it. So that's the gauge cluster.
*  So the steering wheel spins around that stuff.
*  So all that stuff sits behind the wheel and it's all mechanical clocks.
*  Like, look at it.
*  It's digital and mechanical at the same time.
*  Going over it here. Yeah.
*  I mean, it is just a piece of art.
*  And this is definitely like three and a half million dollars.
*  Oh, crazy money. If you could get one. Right.
*  It's probably five million, but you probably can't even get three point
*  eight million pounds or is that is that pounds or euros?
*  What is that little thing squiggly thing? That's pounds pounds.
*  So what is three three point eight million pounds?
*  I mean, it's over four dollars.
*  It's an incredible car.
*  But I mean, you're you basically have a house.
*  You're driving around a fucking house. Too crazy.
*  Look at that little touch screen pops up.
*  Look at that screen. We.
*  I got spins around says Bugatti.
*  Yeah, baby. Why are you laughing?
*  Why does it spin around?
*  Why didn't just come out the way? Because it's like, look at my.
*  Yeah, it's a total look at my dick.
*  It's a big old Italian that, hey, Joey, look at my dick.
*  It's incredible. That's incredible.
*  Yeah. Yeah. The technology is just I mean, it always it's like, what's going to
*  what will be around in 20 years?
*  Because I got to say, when Bugatti, Pagani and Kona
*  said when they do these things, I know I always say think like this is outrageous.
*  Yeah. But I'm also like, it's so cool that you have a spaceship like you.
*  That's basically getting into the ground ship.
*  Yeah. Do you know Sam Altman?
*  He's always the head of OpenAI.
*  Yes. He's always kind of said, I'm not doing this for money.
*  I don't make any money.
*  And they just busted him in a four million dollar Kona seg.
*  They did. Yes. Oh, that's awesome.
*  See if you can find that car.
*  The video of him in that car.
*  I don't need money with me. Money.
*  I'm not even interested in money.
*  He's driving around a four billion dollar Kona seg.
*  Look at it. Oh, go back to the beginning.
*  So you see him get in it.
*  Does it show him get in it?
*  No, that's him.
*  It's fucking. Yeah.
*  Elon was mocking him.
*  Look at that. Got a four million dollar car.
*  There he is. Hi, busted, bro.
*  Hey, bro. I think you like money.
*  Look, you don't buy one of those unless you really want to get rich.
*  Yeah. And you also want everyone to know how fucking rich you want.
*  Everyone to know how rich and you're rich right now.
*  Enough. I don't have a four million dollar car.
*  I wouldn't drive that.
*  I'd be freaked out.
*  I can't drive. I can't park it anywhere.
*  What am I going to do?
*  That's crazy. It's insane.
*  So that means he's got way more money than me.
*  So I go, well, I'm not.
*  How much money make it? What are you doing?
*  Yeah. What are you doing?
*  You're driving a four million dollar car.
*  That's so and you're telling everybody you're not trying to make money.
*  If you're not interested in money, you get a Mercedes.
*  You get a nice class. People get mad at you.
*  You really want people to not get mad at you.
*  Get a Lexus, get an LS 500 cruiser on in style.
*  No one's going to get mad at you.
*  People. Yeah, they're fine with that.
*  You have a four million dollar car, hyper car, and you you're involved
*  in artificial intelligence and it's supposed to be open AI.
*  And then also became private company.
*  There's like a lot of weirdness with like what happened with the money.
*  Do you know? Yeah, the amount.
*  Oh, he's got an Altman car collection.
*  He's got a McLaren F1, two McLarens.
*  He's got the F1. He's got some chatter.
*  Well, he probably already had a bunch of money already. Right.
*  Like, so how did he come into open AI?
*  He says he's worth over two billion dollars.
*  Well, there you go. So he's got a four million dollar car.
*  He's got he's got two billion dollars.
*  Yeah. Him and his husband. Yeah.
*  His partner. Just am.
*  Yeah, that that checks out.
*  Cheddar and also disposable income because I ain't making no kids.
*  Yeah. Let's go.
*  Let's go. Let's go. Four million dollar car.
*  I don't want money. This money's not important to me.
*  Yeah, I don't like it.
*  Well, what did Elon say about it?
*  Because it was something about Elon mocking him.
*  It's like because, you know,
*  Elon was a part of open AI in the beginning.
*  Then he was like, hey, this isn't so open. Right.
*  What's going on here?
*  He brought up the threat that this is.
*  Elon mocks open.
*  What is he saying? How is he mocking him?
*  Oh, what does it say?
*  Open AI drive one of those expensive cars.
*  How did open AI become a for profit business when it was a nonprofit?
*  Elon says great question.
*  But also, if this guy was already a billionaire,
*  so was he a billionaire before open?
*  And this was probably separate from him.
*  When that happened on Twitter, I don't think someone's
*  adding that in with this video of him in the car.
*  Oh, are they? Yeah.
*  Oh, those dirty bitches.
*  What's the point?
*  You sure that wasn't quoting the actual video?
*  It could have been, but it might be.
*  It might be. What's the what's the origin of his money?
*  That's a good question.
*  What's the origin of Sam Altman's wealth?
*  Where do you make all the. Cheddar.
*  He's got a four million dollar car.
*  Billions. Four million dollar car is also like, look at my day.
*  It's just like the Bugatti.
*  It's a huge flex at my day.
*  Yeah. According just to quick search,
*  there's various investments through his venture capital firm, including.
*  So he's balling. Airbnb Stripe.
*  Oh, Airbnb was a big one.
*  So he's balling. He's already balling.
*  So don't be hating kids.
*  Why? The guy's making it.
*  It's out there rocking in the free world.
*  Fucking rad. Yeah.
*  The thing about those cars, those cars are really fun.
*  But you know what my most fun car to drive is actually the most engaging car
*  is my little air cooled 964, that Porsche RX America.
*  RS America is not the fastest.
*  Yeah, not the fastest, but any stretch of the imagination.
*  It's slow. My favorite is my slowest to GT4.
*  Yeah. Has that demand upgrade.
*  Yeah, but that car is way faster than my car.
*  But it's that car is pretty fucking fast.
*  It's pretty fast, but it's not like I think everything else I have is almost faster than it.
*  So it's just engaging. Yes.
*  Yeah. And it's a and it puts the biggest smile on my face. Right.
*  It's very fun. Yeah. That's like my my white car, the G3 RS, the Shark Works car.
*  Same kind of thing. It's just real raw.
*  But they're not as raw as that little red car.
*  That little red car is like you're on an awesome ride at Disneyland.
*  Yeah. Where you're in control.
*  This you feel everything. No power steering.
*  The you know, there's like power assisted brakes.
*  There's no air conditioning, no heat, no nothing.
*  Light as fuck. 300 horsepower.
*  And it's just a thrill.
*  And you just it just makes your whole body tingle.
*  Yeah. It's like exciting.
*  That is to me the most fun thing.
*  Doesn't it? You don't have to be going fast.
*  No, it's crazy.
*  Merging on the highway, getting to 65 miles an hour is a fucking thrill.
*  Yeah. Whereas like in the Tesla, it's like, yeah.
*  It's just no sound.
*  All of a sudden you go in 70. You don't even notice it.
*  That car is like my problem with some of these like faster cars
*  that I have and that exist is that a lot of times when you take them out,
*  you're like, yeah, I'm not really getting to drive this thing. Right.
*  You know, because you're if you're going 75. Right.
*  And you have to go to a track. You have to.
*  Yeah. You have to enjoy it. Yeah. Yeah.
*  And how often you do that?
*  That's the fucking thing is that like you tell yourself
*  that, you know, we've been together. Yeah.
*  And you're like, I want to do this all the time.
*  Let's do it next month. It's hard to do.
*  Let's definitely do well next month.
*  We probably can't because next month is F1.
*  But after F1, after F1. Yeah. After F1, we'll do another day.
*  The ultimate baller move, the ultimate.
*  Like all these guys, they want to get fucking shot toes in France and poll.
*  This is the ultimate baller move.
*  You get a giant piece of land that's flat.
*  And you put yourself a fucking racetrack on it and let's go.
*  Somebody did this in Austin.
*  It's for sale, I think. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Somebody in the greater Austin area.
*  Don't tell me. Yeah, I swear to God. Don't tell me this.
*  Don't do this. And then a guy, a billionaire in Japan just built one
*  that you talk. Yeah.
*  He built a track that you can you can get a membership at.
*  Oh, and at his track. Oh, that's pretty dope.
*  That's pretty fucking cool. That's a good move.
*  So if you know some cool car people, you can hang out together. Yeah.
*  They have that alone on your track.
*  Nobody saw my laptop.
*  Callie has that out in like Indigo.
*  Oh, yeah. That area.
*  It's a private,
*  like a really nice track that has like a country club.
*  It has a restaurant and you can house your cars there.
*  That'd be so addictive. I know. So addictive. I know.
*  Even in a miyada, just going around and something fun.
*  Miyadas are amazing track. Yeah. Right.
*  It's like that's what I'm saying.
*  It's like it's not about how fast you go.
*  It's about how much fun it is to go fast.
*  Like there's cars that go wait like my Tesla.
*  It's the best example.
*  Goes way faster than anything else I own, but it's not as fun.
*  No, there's a different there's a fun factor to the roar of the engine.
*  The feeling of the tires is shifting the gears yourself.
*  All of it. The fun part.
*  The fun is just it's I mean, that's the joy of it.
*  That's why you keep getting them.
*  And everybody today is chasing numbers.
*  They're all chasing Nürburgring times and zero to 60s and quarter miles.
*  Yeah. And it makes you lose sight of like the real thrill of driving.
*  It's also dangerous for everybody on the street.
*  You got these vans up kids out there with a fucking zero.
*  There's a replica of the Istanbul
*  F1 track in Texas, and it's for sale.
*  Holy shit.
*  Isn't that crazy?
*  Guys got an F1 track in his fucking yard.
*  Isn't that nuts? That's nuts.
*  And I feel like it's very Texas.
*  Where is that? This is like the state that looks like it's down by the ocean.
*  It's an Amarillo.
*  Scroll scroll up a little so I can see that image better.
*  Yeah. Is that the ocean in the back?
*  What's that blue shit?
*  I think that's just the field.
*  If it says it's Amarillo, it's all the way up in Oklahoma.
*  Oh, is that where Amarillo is?
*  Oh, I don't know where Amarillo is.
*  Like the top tip top 50 acre complex for sale.
*  Click on it. How much?
*  For a reasonable price, it says.
*  Let's go.
*  Two million bucks. Hang on.
*  For real. Hang on.
*  Hang on. This thing just got juicy.
*  How far is that drive?
*  Find out how far that drive hours.
*  Hmm. How far is that flight?
*  20 minutes. There you go. Pretty quick.
*  Let's go.
*  Ship cars there once.
*  Don't make me do this.
*  Come on, dude.
*  Well, I want to get a ranch.
*  I've been talking about getting a ranch.
*  There's one for sale right there.
*  But I want a different kind of ranch.
*  No, you don't. You want survival ranch.
*  It's right there.
*  Survival right on the outside.
*  Not survival. It is.
*  That's it's acres and acres, man.
*  This is a small portion.
*  I had Chris Harris on the other day.
*  Yeah, I'd love that, dude.
*  Yeah, that dude can drive.
*  If we had a track,
*  there was an airport right next to it.
*  God damn it.
*  If we had a track like real close
*  and we could take Chris Harris out,
*  how much fun would that be?
*  Awesome. That dude's so fucking great.
*  I love watching him drive, too.
*  He's he's fucking fantastic.
*  He loves cars.
*  And when you're around, like someone who really loves cars,
*  he loves all kinds of cars, too.
*  You know, he knows his shit.
*  I like I like watching his videos.
*  Great. Yeah. Fun dude.
*  He got fucked over on that whole Top Gear deal.
*  He did? Yeah.
*  I don't know about the cop top gear story.
*  How it ended is horrible.
*  And did due to an accident.
*  And he was and he apparently had gone to the producer saying,
*  we have to stop pushing this.
*  We're going to someone's going to get her killed.
*  And then someone got hurt real bad.
*  But it's a real big guy, though.
*  And, you know, he got fucked up from this flipped over a three wheeler
*  and got really fucked up, but survived.
*  And then they killed the show.
*  Really? Yeah. Yeah.
*  It was crazy.
*  After he had kind of worn.
*  He also experienced a shit ton of online hate
*  because he was replacing Jeremy Clarkson.
*  So everybody fucking hated him.
*  But meanwhile, he's like the best auto journalist there is.
*  He's so funny. Such a good guy.
*  And people are mad that he's not Jeremy Clarkson.
*  Like, hey, Jeremy Clarkson is still on the air.
*  You fucking idiots. Yeah.
*  Go over to the Amazon.
*  Get the Jeremy Clarkson. It's great.
*  Go watch that, too. Yeah.
*  Fucking morons. No, that's that's too bad.
*  I think Chris does great work.
*  I love watching him review stuff.
*  And you can tell, like, not only is he skilled when he's on track,
*  but that he's genuinely having a good time.
*  You can tell he loves it. Oh, he's smiling and laughing.
*  He's going to do more of his own stuff.
*  And good. Him and I were. Yeah, we were talking about that.
*  I was encouraging that.
*  I was like, you really need to be doing your own thing.
*  Like, you're you're so good at automotive journalists.
*  You're so fun. People love watching you.
*  You should be doing your own show online.
*  You shouldn't be dealing with other people.
*  Yeah, there's no need for that.
*  And also like the Top Gear Top Gear is great show and everything like that.
*  But they all want to do like crazy stunts.
*  Like they threw a car off the side of a bridge with a bungee cord attached.
*  You're like, why? Why? Why?
*  Yeah, they why they get to a point on all these shows.
*  Yeah, it's just a producer segment.
*  And what we were saying was for television, that's what people like.
*  But for the Internet, like for YouTube, completely different audience.
*  Then you get enthusiasts.
*  So like if you get the newest GT3 RS and Chris Harris is reviewing it,
*  it'll have millions of views because you want to see a guy
*  can really fucking drive, really loves cars and understands them.
*  Review the car.
*  I'm like, that's where you're at your best, man.
*  A thousand percent for the enthusiasts, not for the casual dorks
*  who wants to see a car go off a dam on a bungee cord.
*  Yeah, I mean, also on those on those Internet videos, too, is that
*  the great thing is you get there.
*  Somebody like him gives you an authentic reaction.
*  Yes. And they give you authentic critiques.
*  Yeah. They're like, you know what?
*  They they change the seats on this.
*  Yeah. And it's not as good.
*  Or they'll talk about the suspense and they'll give you like the insight
*  that if you're really thinking about getting that car, you go like,
*  oh, maybe I want the previous generation.
*  Like they give you real insight.
*  Yeah. Yeah, exactly.
*  Yeah. He gives a lot of good criticism to vehicle.
*  Matt Farah does a great job with that.
*  Matt does awesome. That's awesome.
*  There's a couple of the guys that do that stuff.
*  Straight pipes.
*  Chris works with Singer and, you know, Singer is doing a turbo now.
*  Yeah, they are. Oh, my God.
*  There's a green one.
*  He went to the go to the factory and they're showing it.
*  The attention to detail is so fucking incredible.
*  Singer number one. The very first one is here in Austin.
*  Really? I saw it in person.
*  Was it like a person? Pretty cool.
*  They're fucking. It's cool.
*  It's a guy who has a few.
*  And I'm sure he's like, here's number one.
*  That's probably worth a lot of money.
*  So you can find the Singer turbo video with Chris Harris, because it's
*  I just want to see the green one.
*  And it's like it looks kind of like an old 911 turbo.
*  Is it that? Yeah, that's it.
*  That's it. Yeah, that's it.
*  But it's it looks kind of like an old 911 turbo.
*  But then when you see the details of it, you're like, oh, they do an awesome job.
*  This is way better than a regular gorgeous, way better than a regular.
*  See if you can find the video.
*  Because the video is incredible, dude.
*  Now, that's the video of his original car.
*  This is how I push click that real quick, because that was before Singer.
*  He had this car made and this is oh, no, this is Singer.
*  Oh, OK. This is the this is a different one.
*  This is just how many years ago was this?
*  Twenty two. OK.
*  This is the dynamics and lightweight study one.
*  This is the crazy three million dollars.
*  Singer. Oh, my God. This one's different.
*  This one's not a turbo.
*  This is their super lightweight, incredible car.
*  This car's incredible.
*  Yeah. Oh, yeah.
*  Fucking nails it.
*  But this car is crazy, crazy expensive.
*  Yeah, three million.
*  Yeah, but it's immaculate, immaculate.
*  Sing Singer turbos put in turbo singer turbo green.
*  Go to videos.
*  Click on videos and go to recent.
*  OK, right there where it says more than 10 years.
*  Click that. There you go.
*  Bam. OK, this is it.
*  So look at that fucking thing.
*  So this is this is the turbo.
*  So it looks kind of like a 911 turbo from like whatever year
*  that would be like 1980 or whatever the fuck it was.
*  But it's way more smooth and polished and refined.
*  And it's just when you see it parked and still, it's just amazing.
*  Like there are attention to details just off the fucking charts, man.
*  Yeah.
*  Like this, go back so you could see.
*  So that was that's the car.
*  So they're just going over all the things that they massaged
*  and changed on the car and all the details where you get a scent.
*  There is you get a sense of what it looks like.
*  Look at that thing.
*  That is fucking rad.
*  Cars don't get prettier.
*  They just get different.
*  They don't get prettier than that.
*  They just get different.
*  And then that dark, cool, metallic green.
*  Like, look at that thing.
*  I would get talked into this in this moment if they were like,
*  and then you want it.
*  Yeah.
*  How much do you think that fucker cost?
*  That's not as much as the DLR.
*  No, it's not.
*  I think I don't know.
*  You're probably DLS.
*  You get so much customization involved in it, right?
*  Probably a million bucks.
*  That or just under, you know, around there.
*  I think they can make these from what I remember for a little bit less
*  than what they were making.
*  Because they were just doing nine six fours before, I think, right?
*  That they can make these.
*  That's not a nine six four chassis.
*  They don't start with a nine six four on the turbo.
*  I don't know.
*  I'm saying on the pre like, you know, singers were all just one model before.
*  Right. Those were more expensive for them to just even produce.
*  Singer DLS turbo.
*  Oh, boy. So starts as a nine six four.
*  But this is a DLS turbo.
*  That's a different one.
*  Look how sick that thing looks.
*  That's the that is another level.
*  That's the dynamic lightweight study.
*  Yeah, Porsche turbo, which is bananas.
*  That thing looks that doesn't look anything like anything that's ever existed before.
*  No, and that's the difference.
*  Definitely more expensive.
*  Oh, yeah. That's the one we were just looking at.
*  I think you could produce those.
*  Look at that thing. That's insane.
*  Look at. Oh, my God.
*  That thing's insane. Looking.
*  Are you going to make a phone call? No, no.
*  Get away from me.
*  There's like a line where I won't cross.
*  Really? Yeah.
*  What's the line? Oh, really?
*  Yeah. That looks fucking amazing.
*  Insane. You start getting into million dollar cars like, what are we doing?
*  That's OK. What the fuck are we doing here?
*  Fine. Yeah. It's just no.
*  That's true. It's not a Bugatti.
*  It's also a different kind of thing than a look at my dick.
*  You know, it's more of like, oh, you know, car, you're passionate.
*  Yeah. You know what the fuck gets the wheel spinning.
*  That's yeah. That's that's.
*  I just love that there's people like they're like, you know, the Gunther
*  works guy, these people that they're making those things.
*  So fucking cool.
*  I just love that someone who just goes so hard.
*  A roof. Yeah. I want to.
*  They're not even really Porsches, right?
*  I don't know. I mean, they can't even really call them a Porsche.
*  It's like all roofs. Yeah.
*  But it looks exactly like a Porsche.
*  Like, what is this?
*  I definitely want to see what it's like.
*  Like go to a roof's website.
*  Are you F the when you see like the new one that they have the crazy?
*  It's water cooled. Right.
*  But it looks like an air cooled car. Right.
*  Yeah. I've never been in one.
*  I've just seen photos and videos and stuff.
*  And it makes you go like, what's this like?
*  I mean, I must be insane. Yeah.
*  And there's these cars like that that are just like completely look at that.
*  Whoa. That's a nine nine three turbo base.
*  And so that's their turbo are that they make.
*  Look at that fucking thing.
*  So this is the one.
*  These are the ones that are weird, the ones that aren't like scroll up.
*  Scroll back up.
*  Rough car. So that one.
*  So CTR anniversary.
*  So that one, I don't think.
*  Is a Porsche. Really?
*  I don't think it starts off as a Porsche.
*  I think it's all their shit.
*  And it just makes it look like it looks exactly like a Porsche.
*  But I don't believe it has.
*  I think it's a new car.
*  But yes, the Monaco completely developed by rough.
*  Roof rather, it's a type of aviation.
*  CTR reminiscent of the legendary yellowbird.
*  So the yellowbird was a Porsche.
*  There was a roof yellowbird from like what was like the 80s.
*  Remember that one, that Porsche one that was crazy.
*  But this is not really a Porsche.
*  This is a roof car that they make that just looks basically ripping off Porsche.
*  Really? Yeah.
*  I mean, what about the other ones are modified?
*  Exactly. The other one that one was a nine nine three.
*  That was like they take the base nine nine three and they juice it up.
*  But this one, I think, is entirely developed by them.
*  Wow. Yeah.
*  It's supposed to be madness.
*  Supposed to be total madness.
*  Roof holler at me, man.
*  Completely redesigned.
*  Yeah.
*  Scroll up so I can see the image of the front.
*  Look at that fucking thing.
*  Whoa. Fucking cool.
*  And look how fat the tires are.
*  That thing has had some group.
*  Yeah. You get it to why you encounter these people with just like nothing but Porsches.
*  Yeah. It's just so.
*  There's something about them.
*  Yeah. I want to.
*  What about the other one that you guys?
*  Yeah. Like you just kind of want to keep going.
*  Yeah. There's a there's also something about the size of them.
*  Right. They're so small and compact that when you're in them, you feel like
*  you're you're like you feel like you're in a race car.
*  Yeah. Hunker in there.
*  There's something weird about even though these get obviously very expensive,
*  that I've always felt like it's a more accessible to the world car
*  than other supercars.
*  You know, like you for sure.
*  You can see a Porsche parked in a grocery store parking lot.
*  Right. Like you're just like, oh, it's fucking rad.
*  But you see a Lambo and you're like, what the fuck is this person doing?
*  Right. Like this is out of his mind.
*  Yeah. It just doesn't feel like a pit Lambo with the H.E.B.
*  parking lot. It's crazy.
*  Get out of here, bro. Crazy. Yeah.
*  Yeah. Coming out with giant sunglasses on looking for attention to wrap around.
*  It's just trying to get punched.
*  Sam and his fucking conus egg.
*  Yeah. That is that that's ridiculous.
*  There's so many people that see people like that, too, and they really want to smack them.
*  Yeah. They see you with that thing like, I just want to smack that guy.
*  And it's fucking stupid.
*  Yeah. Nobody has any like sympathy for you on the road if you're in something like that.
*  And you crash. Ha ha ha ha.
*  Or like try to murder people.
*  Yeah. Fuck you.
*  Fuck you. You can't get in front of me, douchebag.
*  Yeah. That was percent.
*  You got to go somewhere. No, no.
*  I was just looking at where it was. Sorry.
*  Sorry. Addictive, man.
*  I know. They're addictive.
*  You ever thought I like going to a flip phone?
*  Oh, Ari style. Yeah.
*  Wasn't that Dana, too?
*  Dana had it in the beginning.
*  He had a flip phone early on.
*  But then it got to the point where, you know, he has to manage the social media of the UFC.
*  So he has to be able to look at things online.
*  And, you know, he's saying your praises.
*  We were with him in Vegas.
*  Talking about you. Fucking guy loves you, man.
*  I love him, too. Yeah.
*  He's great. If it wasn't for him, that sport would not be what it is.
*  We told us the story about you, about him clearing out the New York offices.
*  Oh, yeah. And he put it in the Viet.
*  He's checking tapes. Yeah.
*  And he sees you on Keenan, Ivory Waynes.
*  Yeah, yeah. That's what it was.
*  He was like, I need this fucking guy.
*  Yeah. Yeah. It was crazy because in the beginning, I didn't want to do it
*  when he was trying to get him because I had already worked for the UFC in the past.
*  From 97 to 98, I did post fight interviews.
*  I was like, I'm out.
*  And then they bought it in 2001.
*  And he was trying to talk me into working for them.
*  I liked I don't want to work. Really?
*  Yeah. I was like, I don't want to do this.
*  But I would ask him, you know, hey, have you ever watched K1?
*  Do you guys watch Pride?
*  Do you know about this guy?
*  You ever see Funaki fight?
*  Have you seen Hicks and Gracie?
*  He's even better than Hoyst.
*  Like we started having these conversations and he was like,
*  how much of this shit you watch?
*  I was like, it's the only sport I know.
*  I don't even know the rules to basketball.
*  And they blow that whistle. I don't know what the fuck is going on.
*  That's hilarious.
*  I told him the story about how when I would go with you on these weekends
*  and I'm like, you know, just like as a fan of sports and broadcasting,
*  I was like, so where's like your prep book?
*  You know, like and you're like, it's all up here.
*  And I'm like, what are you talking about?
*  You're about to call seven hours and you and you said you go,
*  there's nothing else up here cluttering my mind with other sports.
*  I only know one sport. Yeah. Yeah. But that's true.
*  I mean, I do watch fights, but when I watch fights, I don't have to like say,
*  oh, this guy's got a great question mark. I already have. I know.
*  I know what he does. I know what that guy does.
*  Yeah, that's impressive. I've seen him fight a hundred.
*  But it's but it really is true that I don't have any clutter in there.
*  Yeah, I believe it. I don't have any football in there.
*  I don't know what's going on with football.
*  What's the offside? Yeah. Why is he at a flag? What's a down?
*  Why is it? Why is it first down now? What is happening?
*  Oh, that guy got hurt. That's all I know. Yeah. Oh, that was a bad.
*  Well, he ran with the ball pretty far.
*  I don't know what's going on. And I don't want to know. I don't care.
*  I can still enjoy it. Sure.
*  I have room for a couple of things in my head, you know, like combat sports
*  things and just smash them all together.
*  If you had to put something that interests you even somewhat
*  outside of combat sports, MMA and all that, what what sport would be like second?
*  I mean, it's a distant second.
*  But what would be the one where you're like, oh, I enjoy that.
*  Where a sport that I don't participate that I can watch. Yeah.
*  And like that you would sit down and outside of combat sports.
*  Yeah. If somebody had it on, you'd be like, all right, I'll watch some of this with you.
*  I maybe would look what's going on with cricket.
*  What are you guys doing? Cricket.
*  Yeah. I mean, what is that?
*  The hell's happening? Really?
*  Why you got that paddle?
*  You'd be I'll tell you what I really liked watching is soccer.
*  We went to the Austin professional soccer game. Yeah.
*  Soccer's legit.
*  Here's one of the reasons why soccer is legit and why it's not going to become
*  successful in America is because they don't take breaks.
*  So there's no fucking commercial time.
*  There's no time to shove Taco Bell down your face.
*  They don't like any. No breaks. Really?
*  Nope. Nope. It goes for a certain amount of time.
*  I forget how long a soccer match has increased in its popularity.
*  Yeah. Tenfold here in the last decade.
*  I'm telling you, if you go to see it live, it's fun.
*  I've been to multiple games. Incredible, right?
*  Yeah, it's unbelievable.
*  And the arena that they have here in Austin is amazing.
*  It's great. You don't realize that it's, you know,
*  compared to what we're used to for like American football stadiums.
*  Right. It's small.
*  It doesn't feel small because every seat in that house is fantastic.
*  Yep. And it's yeah, it's great competition.
*  We keep getting better players here.
*  I mean, I was somebody who, you know, I grew up not into soccer at all.
*  And half my family was like, what's wrong with you?
*  Because they're all South American. Right.
*  And they're in Argentina. It's fucking huge.
*  Argentina, it's the fucking bigger than any bigger than religion.
*  It's just it is religion.
*  And I mean, my Peruvian cousins were all like,
*  how do you not like soccer?
*  The whole world loves it.
*  The whole world loves it.
*  But I do think it's cool that in the last for me, like in the last decade plus,
*  first of all, we lived in a time with like some generational talent,
*  you know, with like Ronaldo and Messi and these guys.
*  And it's like shifting now to Mbappe and these just incredible, incredible talents.
*  So I think high level anything becomes interesting.
*  When I would watch the El Clásico, the Madrid Barcelona game
*  at the height of these of these guys, club powers in the like 10 years ago,
*  you're watching such a high stakes, high level game.
*  You can have zero interest.
*  And you're like, holy shit. Yeah, this is so incredible.
*  And I think that and and Premier League stuff kind of, you know,
*  it's just it there.
*  It kind of drifted over to the point where we're like, hey, you know,
*  soccer's been played here forever.
*  Just didn't have that same popularity.
*  But this MLS stuff has continued to grow and grow.
*  And people, you know, I remember Saturday mornings during our football season.
*  A lot of times you're putting it on now and you'll see
*  soccer games like from the Premier League was on NBC for a while.
*  I don't know if they still have that contract.
*  But here you go.
*  But like it just has and they keep getting, you know, better talent
*  on the state side that I think will will continue to see it
*  become more popular.
*  If you go see it live, you'll get hooked.
*  Also, I'll tell you that. Yeah, the MLS games are like that, too.
*  Oh, my God. I got to see I was on tour in Australia last year
*  and I got to see the Australian Open Men's Finals with Djokovic. Yeah.
*  Seeing that in person, there's also like not a bad seat
*  in that place. It's it's a whole other thing.
*  It made me go, OK, I want to go to all like the the big real Wimbledon.
*  I want to go. Really?
*  He he was just incredible to see in person again, just somebody so
*  so talented at their sport that watching it live
*  change. You know, I played tennis growing up and like
*  I've watched tennis tournaments, but live is everything.
*  I mean, I've told people that about UFC, too.
*  It's like, yeah, it's cool to watch on TV, but it's so different in person.
*  It's yeah. Especially with no commentary.
*  You're just watching the actual violence like, oh, my God.
*  It's so real. Yeah.
*  And then you have a moment of like
*  the sound of the crowd dies and you hear a yeah.
*  You're like, oh, that's that guy's face.
*  Oh, yeah. It's like, holy shit.
*  The my favorite place to see fights is in the Apex Center
*  because the UFC Apex Center has no audience.
*  Yeah. So small. It's incredible.
*  And during Covid, that was the best thing about Covid for me.
*  How about the sphere thing? It's going to be nuts.
*  That's this weekend. I know. I know.
*  Yeah, I'm pretty pumped. I don't know what they're going to do.
*  I know they have.
*  I don't know if they're going to show the fights on the ceiling.
*  So, you know how they have video monitors in the studio where you always see
*  with the video monitors or showing you the fights of the people that he told us
*  what they're doing. Can you say it?
*  I mean, I don't know.
*  We were on a podcast.
*  I don't think it's been released.
*  But you didn't tell me, dude, he's like, it's a fucking it's a movie
*  that's going to play about the history of Mexican combat sports.
*  I know about that. There's six of them.
*  There's six different small films.
*  Yeah. OK. That's that's what he was telling us.
*  Yeah. And he was just like, it's all everything is authenticated.
*  And like, you know, like and the crew that made it is Mexican.
*  It's just like this. Yeah.
*  Mexican plight story.
*  And I mean, I don't know if the broadcast goes up on the wall.
*  That's what I'm thinking.
*  I'm wondering if you can see the fights take place on the ceiling.
*  Jesus. Which should be an advantage.
*  You see a show there in certain positions.
*  No, I have not. Have you?
*  No, I heard it's just I've heard it's insane.
*  But what did Burt go to see the dead?
*  He's seen a few there. He saw the course. Yes. He's.
*  He saw the dead and he saw
*  he went to the U2 show when they were there, too.
*  Oh, wow. He said, yeah, he cried so much.
*  You know, of course. Yeah. Yeah. Emotional. Yeah.
*  I cried the whole time. You live as family.
*  My daughters are making fun of me.
*  I'm like, yeah, they should. Yeah.
*  They should mock you.
*  He doesn't just cry.
*  He likes to take photos of him crying and then post it on Instagram.
*  I'm so sad.
*  My daughter went to college. Look, is this one good?
*  How many did he take before he picked that one?
*  Oh, he's a fucking mess when I saw him.
*  Of course. Yeah.
*  The college drop off has got to be heavy.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  He was he's a character. He's on one.
*  He was in a fucking vendor. How's he doing these days?
*  He's he benders. He goes off. He goes on.
*  Yeah, he's he's cleaned up for a little while and he went right back in.
*  He's on a bird. He's in a bird cycle. Yeah.
*  Yeah. He was real clean.
*  And then he was my favorite.
*  He was like, we were somewhere in Vegas and somebody was like,
*  you know, do you want this?
*  He's like, can't hardcore keto.
*  And I was like, OK.
*  And then we go to this.
*  I'm like, OK, this is like we twist your head.
*  That's such a bird or a croaker or croaker.
*  And then we go to this bar and we're pouring drinks, porous, those drinks,
*  you know, we're like our brand.
*  And it's like tons of people.
*  And it's a very fun thing.
*  Everyone's out and getting bottles and drinks and we're signing things.
*  And then and of course, like, you know, he's throwing them back.
*  He's throwing back. And at one point, he's standing there shirtless.
*  And he goes, I'm fucking I'm absolutely fucking shit face.
*  I go, yeah, I can tell.
*  And so I go, hey, you know, some time passes.
*  I go, you want to get out of here?
*  He's like, yeah, I go, OK, we're going to go this way out of this place.
*  And here's the exit. He's like, OK.
*  So I turn this way, say something, then I get ready.
*  He goes, I'm going to fucking stay.
*  And I go, OK, I'll see you later, man.
*  So I leave. I get the fuck out of there.
*  And then I run into him later.
*  I'm like, how was that? He was like, oh, he's like, dude, I was so hammered.
*  I go, yeah, I know.
*  He goes, yeah, I got back and I ate a dozen donuts.
*  I go, what happened to hardcore keto?
*  He goes, I just ate the tops.
*  And I go, that's not how keto works.
*  Yeah, that's where the frosting is.
*  Yeah. What are you talking about?
*  He's a lunatic. Oh, my God.
*  He's still alive. Mm hmm.
*  I wonder how long you do that for.
*  I mean, how long can you do that for?
*  Yeah, he goes, he does it.
*  And then, you know, what will happen is like, so he's like, whatever, real crazy right now.
*  And we'll see him in like a month and he'll be like, oh, yeah, my other favorite phrase,
*  he's like, I quit, quit drinking.
*  I go, when? He goes, Wednesday.
*  And I'm like, it's fucking Friday.
*  He's like, I know, but it's like 48 hours.
*  Nothing like that's not that's a normal person.
*  How that term works.
*  And he's like, he's like, but so he'll get he'll get to one
*  certain point here where he'll be like, I got to clean it up.
*  And he'll just like really clean it up, you know, like won't drink for a while.
*  Clean up the diet.
*  You'll see him just like thin out.
*  He takes a picture on Instagram.
*  He takes a good picture. Sucks his gut in.
*  Sexy picture. This is me now.
*  And then you'll be like, oh, you're good. Three weeks later.
*  Huge. Yeah, it was just it's a cycle.
*  Three weeks later, I see him waddle through the fucking green room at the mothership.
*  I'm like, what the fuck, dude?
*  The fuck are you doing?
*  He goes hard. He goes hard, dude.
*  He goes hard. I've been going hard with
*  eating just super clean, man.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. How long?
*  A couple of months in. Yeah.
*  Yeah. It's funny thing is like by just being so committed to it,
*  anything outside of it now, you feel it.
*  Yes. So I really didn't have a reference for that before.
*  Yeah. You know, because I'm like, I'm eating a lot of, you know,
*  pretty much the same wheelhouse of shit every day.
*  Like I have four eggs, blueberries.
*  A little while later,
*  protein shake, lunch.
*  I had lunch today, 10 ounces of chicken greens.
*  And I have like little things like peanut butter jelly pack.
*  Like a bridge. Clean.
*  Yep. And then dinner, I'll have 16 to 20 ounces of lean protein like sea bass.
*  Salmon. Sometimes I'll have leaner red meats, greens, fruit.
*  You got someone organizing this for you or you're just doing it yourself?
*  Yeah, I saw it. It was fine.
*  I did it because I'm shooting my show next month.
*  And I was like three months out and I was like, fuck, if I don't like dial it in right now,
*  I'm going to show up. Yeah. And I'm going to show up.
*  And I'm going to be like, I wish I just don't want to have regret.
*  Like I didn't try. Right. Right. Right.
*  And I was like, I know I'm not going to look like a Marvel guy in three months,
*  but I know I can clean it up in three months. Yeah. And like, I mean,
*  you just don't want to look at yourself on TV and go, fuck.
*  Yeah. You fucking lose a piece of shit.
*  Yeah. That's the worst.
*  So I've gone down, you know, I'm down to like 204 body fats down.
*  And I have about another month. So I just sticking to it.
*  But the funny thing is like any like the other night I got home and the boys were
*  like, they got what's it called?
*  Like the shaved ice machine and they've been making those,
*  you know, during the day and they're kids.
*  And like, you got to have one. You got to, I got, you know, I go, OK, I'll try it.
*  I'll try it. So they shave the ice in the machine and they pour flavors into it.
*  And I take, you know, a few spoons full. It's very sweet. Right.
*  Dude, within an hour, I'm like, like doubled over running to the toilet.
*  Yep. And I'm like, oh yeah, because I can isolate it now.
*  Before when I was eating like a trash can, like I would just go like,
*  oh, I don't know what it was. Right.
*  It was fucking maybe it was the bread.
*  Also, you get used to feeling like shit. Yeah, you do.
*  That's what Duncan's you know, Duncan had diabetes. Yeah.
*  He got type two diabetes from I think it's from vaping.
*  Sugar for sure, but also vaping.
*  And the reason why I say this is one of the things he found out,
*  he was getting his blood sugar checked and it was spiking.
*  And he's like, I don't even understand. I'm not drinking any soda,
*  not eating any sugar.
*  And then he realized that it spikes after he vapes. Wow.
*  And so because he was, you know, monitoring it.
*  And then he realized, oh my God, there's a reason why this stuff is sweet.
*  There's fucking sugar in the vapes. That makes sense.
*  I've tried them and you're like, yeah, it's really sweet.
*  It's watermelon. How else can you get a watermelon flavor?
*  How else are you going to get a peach flavored vape unless you have some sugar
*  in there? Yeah. How are you getting the fucking apple flavored vapes?
*  Yeah, of course. There's sugar in there. There's sugar.
*  And so the sugar was spiking his blood pressure, his blood sugar.
*  Did he get himself out of it? Yeah. Yeah. He got off of it and got on his end.
*  And, you know, it's just you don't realize that you're poisoning yourself
*  until you stop poisoning yourself. Yeah. And you eat really healthy.
*  And he was like, dude, I don't need naps anymore. I have energy all day.
*  This thing has helped me so much, dude. Like this eating plan.
*  I got it from a nutritionist in L.A., Dr. Guglia.
*  And like I told him
*  a couple of weeks into it, I was like, if I don't lose a pound,
*  I'm already going to thank you for my digestion changing.
*  Like I used to, you know, fucking I got so used to just explosive shits
*  all the time.
*  Like, you know, like Christina was like, are you going to ever see a doctor?
*  I hear this violence coming out of the bathroom.
*  And I'm like, yeah, I got to go check it out.
*  And then I had a colonoscopy a couple of years ago and they were like,
*  you're good. And I'm like, yeah, but I mean, I have diarrhea 14 times a week.
*  Is that normal? And I don't know, man.
*  So this switching to like the way I just described my eating now,
*  I have totally normal gut health. Yeah. That's how it's supposed to be.
*  Yeah. It took me 45 years to figure it out.
*  Well, that's one of the things that's very interesting about Robert F.
*  Kennedy Jr. being connected to Trump in this election.
*  Yeah. Because if Trump winds up winning, they're going to expose our food systems.
*  Robert Kennedy, one of the things that he really wants to do is he wants to
*  expose a bunch of problems we have in our food system. One is glyphosate,
*  glyphosate, which is used. It's a, an herbicide.
*  It's used all over the fucking place. It's in a lot of food.
*  Most people they test or some incredibly high number of people test positive for
*  glyphosate.
*  Really? Yeah. Because you're getting it from organic vegetables even like some
*  vegetables. I shouldn't say organic, but you're getting it from like,
*  there's some stuff that they just spray it on no matter,
*  like I think the most glyphosate, I think it might be corn.
*  So what things contain the most glyphosate? Let's, let's Google that.
*  I think it's corn, rice and different, you know,
*  different vegetables and fruits.
*  If you go to Western Europe, you realize that they don't use any glyphosate,
*  but like our food would be like illegal, illegal grocery stores.
*  Our fruit loops are illegal in Canada. Are they really? Yeah.
*  Cause we use dye. There's all these red dyes and shit in our fruit loops.
*  They have the same fruit loops and can't, they're like, no, no, no,
*  you can't put that stuff in there.
*  So we they have to sell different fruit loops to Canada than they do to America.
*  Some of the most common foods with glyphosate,
*  non-organic cereals and grains harvested with glyphosate.
*  These include wheat, barley, buckwheat, millet, rice, oats, wild rice,
*  popcorn and sorghum, wild rice. So you think wild rice, oh,
*  I'm getting wild rice. It must be healthy. Or popcorn.
*  But a lot of people think that part of the thing that's going on with people,
*  they say they're glucose or gluten intolerant. That what's actually,
*  it's not gluten that's fucking with them. It's glyphosate. Really? Yeah.
*  And we, this is just one of those like, one of those American things,
*  like huge conglomerates that's spraying it down. Yep. Yep. Yep. Monsanto. Yeah.
*  So that's Roundup. And so there's that.
*  And then there's seed oils fucking terrible for you.
*  And they're in everything and they're in everything because they're cheap.
*  And it used to be industrial lubricant and they figured out a way to make it
*  somehow or another turn into food.
*  It's so fucking sad that we have like,
*  I also that most people, myself included,
*  and I'm not even talking about other, like,
*  you just don't have the knowledge of the, like you'd have to,
*  you have to inquire and really be curious about this.
*  And you got to dig for a long time. And if you talk to your doctors,
*  a lot of time doctors don't know jack shit.
*  Most doctors spend a shockingly small amount of time in medical schools studying
*  nutrition. Yeah. Most doctors, they'll tell you,
*  just need a healthy diet. I'm like, look at you, doc. Look at you, doc.
*  You know, I had a fucking neighbor that was a 260 pound cardiologist.
*  Isn't that crazy? Like I'm not exactly seven feet tall. He wasn't.
*  He's shorter than me. And I was like, that's so big. You tell people like,
*  Hey man, your heart's, that's so crazy. It's so crazy. He was wildly overweight.
*  Some people just can't control themselves. They just don't,
*  they don't have a history of control themselves. And so they just don't,
*  they just eat. I mean, bro, I remember Ralphie May. We, uh,
*  one time we, uh,
*  we all left the comedy store and we went to a bar with Stan Hope, me,
*  and a couple other comics and Ralphie, it was Joey and Ralphie was going to meet
*  us there. There was this bar that Stan Hope used to like in Hollywood.
*  We used to go back in the day before Hollywood was a zombie movie. And so, uh,
*  Ralphie doesn't show up. We're waiting for him. Like where the fuck is Ralphie?
*  We were waiting for everybody outside.
*  We were going to all go in together and get a table.
*  And we're sitting outside and Ralph, no Ralphie for a long ass time.
*  And then all of a sudden like an hour later,
*  Ralphie shows up and Ralphie's back seat was just filled with
*  rappers. So this poor guy was so addicted that he couldn't get
*  in his car and drive from the comedy store to this bar,
*  which was like two miles away.
*  He had to stop at a Jack in the box and tear it up.
*  And this was at a time where he got his stomach stapled so he couldn't eat any
*  meat. So he wasn't eating meat.
*  So he's eating jalapeno poppers from Jack in the box, just stacks of them.
*  Yeah. He was, he was really sick. He was sick.
*  He ate through his stomach stapling twice. I got to piss real bad. Oh,
*  let's piss. Okay, let's piss. Let's pee. Let's pee together.
*  And we're back. Great pee.
*  It's just such a game changer. Yeah.
*  When you have to pee and you can't concentrate, it's so hard to talk.
*  I was just like, your eye starts to flutter. Yeah.
*  Ah, makes me think about those debates.
*  Like what if someone has to pee in the debate?
*  You got to dial your water and just write. Do you have,
*  I have a pre show pee routine. Do you? Yeah. Kind of, cause I,
*  I would say like my fixation is I kind of have to, when I get like,
*  during the day I'm drinking water and you know, a couple of coffees.
*  And it's like, if we're on the road, you know, we go work out,
*  I'm going to increase the water intake, like start drinking more. And then,
*  you know, you get ready, head over to the venue and it's like, okay,
*  I get there. The show's going to be in 45 minutes. It's like I pee,
*  but then I keep going like, oh, here's a water. I'm going to pour a diet Coke.
*  I'm going to take on stage in a cup water. And then it's like, all right,
*  start the show. I introduce, you know, opener. And then I'm like, all right,
*  I'm going to go pee and I'll be, I'll be back. And I do that. And then it's like,
*  Hey, he's got five minutes left. And I always go, do I have to pee again?
*  Like this is like a real, it's like you're going to get a,
*  go to a spa and they're like, uh, you're going to get a massage.
*  And they're like, you have to pee. And I go, do I? I think so. Yeah. I want,
*  yeah. I think there's four drops left. I'd like to get them out.
*  The worst is if you have to shit.
*  If you think you're going to go on stage for an hour and you have to take a shit
*  Oh my God. How much time does he have left? He has three minutes left.
*  I can't shit in three minutes. I know that is the,
*  but your body does this thing where it'll shut the shit thing down.
*  Unless it's like a real fucking emergency. Right. But you're right.
*  Have that on stage.
*  Have I ever had that I have to fucking I puked on the side of the stage.
*  Really? Yeah. That was, those are sick. Yeah. And that was horrible.
*  Literally in a can in the wings. Oh my God. Jesus. Like that was,
*  that was rough. Did you go back on stage? Yep. Did they know you threw up?
*  Nope. Until I told them. Wow.
*  Nope. But the pee one,
*  like I hate when you go, all right, I'm just, yeah, I'm just going to go out there.
*  What am I? A fucking toddler? Just go fucking do your shit.
*  And I'm like five minutes in, I'm like, I have to pee right now. You know,
*  you just carry that. Your body will like put it out of your mouth,
*  but there's like this discomfort you have the whole time where you're standing.
*  I'm like, I'm going to be out here for a fucking hour.
*  I did it once where I ran off stage and I, you know, the mothership,
*  the way it got to go all the way up, I had to go all the way the fuck upstairs
*  and just piss so hard. And then went back. Yeah. No, no, no, I didn't.
*  It was like, I finished my set. Oh, when you finished. Yeah.
*  But like halfway through my set, I was like, God damn it. I had to pee. Yeah.
*  But someone was in the bathroom like right before I went and I was like, fuck.
*  No, it's, I mean, I, I mean, yeah, I've also,
*  I've peed on the side of the stage before, like in a panic. Yeah. Jesus.
*  I know. On the ground? No, like in a trash can.
*  And in a cup. I've done that too. Yeah. How many times has Ari peed right there?
*  He pisses in fucking kombucha bottles. God. Everything. No.
*  Fucking disgusting. He's gross. He wants you to know he's peeing in the room. Yeah.
*  To show you his nuts.
*  I'm surprised I haven't seen him come. I've seen him pee so many times.
*  We're getting close to October. We're going to do something this year.
*  Dude, I'm shooting the whole month here, but I'll be here. Yeah. Okay. I'll be here.
*  You going to go sober? Yeah, sure. I mean, I'm going to be like
*  shooting five days a week. I'm sure I,
*  Do you think we can get Bart to go sober for a month again?
*  Cause last year he was excited to not do it.
*  I don't think, I don't want to speak for him, but no.
*  Maybe he could use it though. Right? Uh, I don't know.
*  Wouldn't be the worst thing in the world for him.
*  No, it's never the worst thing for, for any of us to take a month off. Sure. Good.
*  I mean, yeah, I always feel like, um,
*  I mean it's, it's what kind of challenges it for the each person,
*  you know? Well, it's easy for me.
*  I haven't had a drink in since I had a couple of glasses.
*  I had a margarita and like a mule
*  Saturday night. So that was it. That was the last time I had a drink.
*  Yeah. I had a few drinks Saturday night in Vegas. Yeah. Yeah. We were doing,
*  I was at dinner with the Mrs.
*  But I haven't had anything to drink since then, which is normal.
*  I can go a week, two weeks. Like it's not, you know, it's not that big a deal.
*  That's what I'm saying. So like, but for Bert, it's a big ass deal. Yeah.
*  It's a test. His, um, will, will for sure. And, and, um,
*  cleans them up. I think, I think he, um,
*  I think he also kind of gets off on the challenge of it because so many people
*  are like, you're going to struggle this, you know, online. And I think that, uh,
*  well, Bert's another one that has that delusional, I can't lose. He is like,
*  he is, I remember, what was the one that I was like, what are you doing?
*  When he was like, I could do the splits. I think I can.
*  I was like, you're going to fucking tear your hamstrings.
*  When he told me he could, I really believed for a second he could.
*  I was like, really? Wow. Yeah.
*  I know because it also is one of those things that Bert could seek, like,
*  you know what I mean? It wouldn't be out of the realm of possibilities. Right.
*  Oh, you have the secret skill. You can also do this. Right.
*  Like when you played tennis and you thought he could serve like a fucking pro.
*  Jesus. I know he has all these like weird,
*  like hidden skills. Yeah. Yeah.
*  I really believe that he could do the splits. Yeah.
*  But he couldn't even come close.
*  It wasn't even in the neighborhood where you did a split once in your life and
*  you got to get it back. You know, like maybe,
*  maybe did it when you were in high school and you can kind of get back there.
*  Yeah. But you can, do you still do them all the time? All the time. Okay.
*  I stretch out constantly. Okay. Especially lately.
*  Cause I've been dealing with like some real stiff back problems.
*  Cause when I shoot a lot of archery,
*  I get real stiff in my right side of my lower back and my neck.
*  Cause I, my bow is 80 pounds to pull back.
*  So I'm pulling back 80 pounds like 150 times a day. Yeah.
*  So then tightens up. Everything's tight. So it really helps the stretching.
*  Massage helps a lot, but man stretching. So I started stretching. I have like,
*  it's not that unusual. It kind of chronically tight hamstrings, you know,
*  that I'm like, fuck. And the, I, the massage definitely helps,
*  but spending a little time every day working on hamstring stretches definitely
*  helped me. It's fucking gigantic.
*  Everyone should stretch and especially for anyone that has like stiffness in
*  their lower back. And a lot of that stuff,
*  like you'd be amazed at how stretching your hamstrings alleviates a lot of
*  stress on your lower back. Yeah. It's all tied there. Most like if,
*  a lot of times that lower back tightness, it's just,
*  you just follow the line.
*  It's like your glutes into your hamstrings and your hamstrings are super tight.
*  They're pulling down and it'll relieve your, your lower back pains. Yeah.
*  Yeah. I do a lot of hamstring exercises too though.
*  I do a lot of Nordic curls. I do those. Those are the shit, man.
*  Once I started getting into those, you know, the neotoes guy stuff,
*  Like Nordic, is that like laying flat? Yeah.
*  You lay flat and you pull yourself up with your hamstrings. It's fucking hard.
*  Really? Yeah. It's hard. Yeah.
*  I do that for sets of six, like six reps, pulling yourself up.
*  And the first time I did it, I couldn't do one. I was like, this is crazy. Really?
*  Yeah. Cause I have strong fucking legs. Like how can I not do this? This is nuts.
*  I couldn't believe I couldn't do it. I was shocked.
*  So I really started concentrating on it. Now I do sets of six,
*  but I think I could probably do nine. If I guessed.
*  I think I could do nine. It's that challenging though. It's fucking hard, dude.
*  It's fucking hard. I don't think I've ever tried it. She's tried. Okay.
*  We'll do it out here. I have one right out in the middle of the lobby. Really?
*  Yeah. I have one in the, I have an extra one if you need one. Oh, okay. Cool.
*  Thanks man. Yeah. I have a bunch of them. I've gotten,
*  there's a, the Tib Bar guy made me a cool one and there's a few other ones.
*  What's his other guy? Mr. Infinity. He made one. That's really good.
*  There's a lot of ones that are adjustable.
*  They do a bunch of different things as well as just,
*  just, just do the Nordic curls. Like some of them,
*  you could do reverse hypers on and a bunch of other lower back exercises,
*  but it's a great one for stabilizing your knee.
*  Really good exercise for cause there's nothing else like it.
*  That's like you're pulling your whole like that's, that's it right there.
*  That's what it looks like when you're doing it. Yeah, that looks,
*  that's the Sora next one. Challenging. It's fucking hard, man. Yeah,
*  it looks like, but the one that's really,
*  the reason why I really like the Tib Bar guy one and the Mr. Infinity one is
*  that you can change the angle of it. So instead of starting flat,
*  like the rogue one that we have outside, you start completely flat.
*  And in the beginning I had to help myself. I had to like,
*  what I would do is I put two fingers down and give myself a little push with
*  the fingers and then complete the reps of my hamstring and then try to lower
*  myself as much as I could and then catch it.
*  But now I've got to the point where I just go all the way down slow and all the
*  way up. No problem. And I could do it,
*  but it took a while to build it up and I was kind of surprised because I thought
*  it was going to be like one of those things like a pistol squat.
*  Like it looks hard, but I have strong legs. I can do that. But I was like,
*  this is fucking impossible. Wow. But it,
*  but you think about that kind of a pull. That's it right there. Who was this one?
*  Tib Bar guys. This one's a really good one, man.
*  So you could use it to do back extensions. You could use it to do reverse hypers,
*  really top-notch stuff.
*  And the angle change is huge because you started off,
*  give yourself a little bit of an angle.
*  So you're already like halfway through the rep and it's much easier and then
*  lower it a little bit. And then, and then eventually you get to flat.
*  I'd like to try it. It's especially for rehabbing that bad knee,
*  the injured knee. It's really good. Anything.
*  I do leg curls too with those, you ever use those
*  monkey feet things? Yeah. That thing's fucking great.
*  And then they have a new one, the monkey feet pro,
*  but they have the plates already built into it. And so you can slide a pin out,
*  you know, like those, uh, like dumbbells that do that. Yeah, sure. Yeah.
*  So it's built in and it's flat at the bottom instead of like having a dumbbell
*  that you have to attach to it. That sounds cool. Yeah, that's the new one.
*  The monkey V pro that's fucking huge,
*  but all those different things to stabilize all those muscles and to do knee
*  raises and fucking phenomenal stuff, man. Yeah, that seems awesome.
*  So if we do sober October,
*  do you think we should have some sort of a challenge this year or should we?
*  I can't, I just won't have any time. Right. I just will be too, way too busy.
*  Are you going to work out at all? Yeah. So I already talked to like my, I go,
*  look, I mean, I've been, I've been preparing, uh,
*  for this thing by training six days a week and,
*  and alternating like I had today was a steady state cardio day.
*  So I did an endurance ride for 60 minutes of bike ride. Um,
*  and then tomorrow morning I'll get up and lift and then, you know, so I, I,
*  so you were organized. I'm organized. I like structure. So, so I'll,
*  I'll follow the, my plan, but I'm able to do right now, our sessions,
*  our lifting, our cardio sessions. Sometimes I can do two a days,
*  like if the schedule allows do two in a day. But I was like, look,
*  I know when we're in production, one other time, no. So I'm just,
*  we're my trainer and I have been figuring out like, all right,
*  what about like, cause I, I've had days where I go, I don't have an hour, right?
*  But you can still like get something good going in 30 minutes. Sure. And I'm like,
*  look, all I gotta do,
*  I just don't want to get into working on production and just go into zero.
*  Cause I'll feel like shit too. So figuring out like, okay,
*  I think it has to be AM for me that this whole idea that I'm going to shoot all
*  day. And then at the end of the day, you're prepping for the next day.
*  And I'm going to go work out now at like nine 30, it's just not going to happen.
*  So we're going to try to organize workouts that are more condensed that I'll
*  keep be able to keep doing through, through production. This six weeks,
*  six, seven weeks of production.
*  And what is the show?
*  So this is the show that I don't think I've ever shown you,
*  but like two years ago I had a break on my tour and I had this kind of distorted
*  sense of income cause you're on tour, you know, and you're like, I want,
*  I love features, but trying to pull a feature together is a huge undertaking.
*  But if you want to shoot like a short film, it's a lot easier to manage.
*  So I go, you know, I had all these things that I've written, you know,
*  five to 10 page short stories and I hit up my friend Rami and I was like,
*  Hey, we'd work together. And so he's the one that directed my, um,
*  my music video.
*  Steven Seagal. So I go, you know, I got a break on tour.
*  I'm willing to write a check to like, to make a short film.
*  I stopped you right there.
*  Did Burt ever have a real hard problem with you stabbing him to death?
*  He's like, I don't know. That's just your humor. He's like, he's like, I,
*  he was like, people asked me and he, and he said, I just told them that's Tom's
*  humor. I guess that's what he finds funny.
*  Cause I was like, if my friend did a video where he stabbed me to death,
*  I might be like, how does he really feel about me?
*  Like what the fuck is going on? He just stabbed me to death on a video.
*  But he is right in that I, I do. I mean, if you see the series,
*  you'll see that like, Oh, this is a warm feeling to you. Like I just,
*  you know, I did. Yeah, I, yeah, it is.
*  This is so ridiculous.
*  And he's so big in that video with the face swap.
*  Yeah, it was great. Deep fake for at that time too.
*  It's gotten so much better now. But anyway, I tell my friend, I go,
*  I want to shoot a short film, you know, like during this break and like,
*  I'll pay for it. And I just want to shoot and put it out kind of like the music
*  video. And he was like looking at, I was sending him scripts and he's like,
*  I think we could actually,
*  if you can take this like 11 days,
*  I think we could shoot three. I'm like, really?
*  Like that's going to be fucking crazy to shoot 11 days in a row on break.
*  And when I should be like taking time down, but I go, okay,
*  so we, we signed up to shoot three. And again, the whole thing is like,
*  we'll just make these because I enjoy making them. You know what I mean?
*  Right. So we shoot them and then we shoot them.
*  We shoot them. And then when we have them, we're like, well,
*  this kind of looks, this kind of is like a show now it's like, like a old,
*  a Twilight zone where it's just like, here's a, you know, here's a short story.
*  So then we went back to a white site,
*  like a sound stage and I shot an introduction to like,
*  I'm the host of a show. And then the idea was,
*  you remember I built like during the pandemic,
*  this pay-per-view kind of website, you know,
*  where people could buy tickets to like live podcasts. I was like, oh,
*  I know what I'll do. I'll cut, we'll cut this together.
*  And then this will be the first like ticketed like pay-per-view event that is
*  a scripted written show as opposed to like a live podcast,
*  which I was really excited by. I was like, look, I don't even care.
*  I don't need to make money.
*  Even if this like helps me recoup a portion of what I spent to
*  make this, I feel like that would be a win.
*  It's just exciting to try something new like that.
*  So it's all cut together, you know, it's super high production quality.
*  And I show it to like agents and they were like,
*  you gotta show this to some of the streamers, you know?
*  I told them my plan. I was like, yeah, my plan was just to do this.
*  And they go, I think we can get you, you can get a series out of this.
*  And we showed it to Netflix and they were like, yeah, we'll do a series.
*  You can do six of these. So now we spent time,
*  we spent time obviously in the writers room writing six episodes worth of these.
*  And each one, each episode will have like a theme and then
*  short stories that are dark, like twisted fucked up stories.
*  They're with a comedic twist to it, right?
*  Like things that are comedic in nature, I would say, but, but dark.
*  So I think it's like a, I like,
*  I say like the best way to describe it is it's kind of a comedic black mirror,
*  short stories that are twisted that have a comedic tone.
*  So do you have the whole app? First of all, you really like to be busy.
*  I mean, I more than anybody I know, I do feel,
*  I think better having a lot going on. Yeah.
*  But you mean you like to be overwhelmed?
*  I don't think, I think there's a line I like,
*  I've discovered in my life that there's a line and that I can,
*  and you have, you figure out the line by living. Well, that you,
*  that you get to it. I'm coming everywhere was the line. That was too much. Right.
*  That because that was, that was your tour. That was the last tour.
*  And that was, we leave Monday and we do shows Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,
*  Friday, Saturday, you know, like that, that, and that was week after week.
*  And that, that was a lot. That was too much.
*  This tour that I've been on this year is like this weekend,
*  I'm in Eugene, Vancouver and Denver. That's it. Thursday, Friday, Saturday.
*  I'm home. I'm home that night. Right. The next week, Cleveland, Buffalo, Toronto.
*  It's like three, three shows, three nights. Right.
*  That's a much more manageable way to live. Yeah. But I had to figure it out.
*  Production too. Production.
*  There's no way to deal to work in production where I'm writing, producing,
*  I'm directing some of them. There's no way to do that without being busy,
*  but it's also a condensed amount of time.
*  That's what I like about productions is that you, you only have a few weeks.
*  You see your end date. We're done here. So we just have to make it happen.
*  So I mean, it'll be a very busy six weeks for me, but it also will be over.
*  And when you plan and when is that going to get out on Netflix?
*  My thought is that it would probably be in the spring. I think, I think.
*  So I'm not sure that conversation will continue, but I'm so fucking stoked for it,
*  dude. Like it, it, we got a great group together to write it.
*  I love that. I get to work with Rami.
*  I'm working with Jeremy Connor and, and just a great crew.
*  And like we're casting here in the next couple of weeks. We're the thing that,
*  one of the things I'm honestly super proud of is that I got them to let me do
*  the show in Austin. And we're going to have Austin production, Austin crew.
*  We're casting Austin actors. So it's like a real Austin production.
*  So that to me was like very fun. I was like,
*  I don't want to go move to Atlanta to do this. I want to do it home.
*  There's gotta be plenty of actors here.
*  Oh, for sure. There's actors here. And also that,
*  and we are doing Austin locations, like we're shooting all over the city,
*  but I think that's fucking cool. That's pretty dope, dude. That's exciting.
*  It's a wild show. When you see this stuff, you're going to be like,
*  you're fucked up, man. I can't wait. I'm excited. Yeah. I'm excited.
*  So when do you start?
*  Our first shoot day is October 7, I think.
*  Wow. That's not long from now. Six weeks of chaos.
*  Six weeks of chaos. And then.
*  There's something about having a goal to like a thing that you're working towards.
*  It just changes your mindset.
*  I think this has helped with like, even like I was telling the focus of like
*  nutrition and health and like, you know,
*  the discipline of that bleeds into the discipline of the writing and like getting
*  these meetings done. And like, yeah, it all comes together.
*  When I was getting ready to do my live special,
*  knowing that there was a date that this had to be done and then it was only on
*  one night.
*  So it was like this like super hyper focus of getting ready for something done.
*  And when I did it, I was like, after it was over, I was like,
*  I want to do that again. Yeah. Yeah. I was at first, I was like,
*  I'm going to do this one time and I'm never going to fucking do this again,
*  because this is a ridiculous idea to be able to do something live to millions of
*  people on Netflix.
*  Well you enjoyed the experience. I liked it.
*  But you liked the heightened pressure.
*  I like it. Yeah. Yeah. I like it. I like it a lot. Yeah. I like it too much.
*  Well that's kind of how I am about being.
*  Have you ever thought about doing a live special? Never. Never thought about it.
*  You should do it. You think so? Yep. I think everybody should do it. Yeah.
*  Everybody's good. You get it. You do good shows. You do great sets for,
*  you know, headlining sets, just get it dialed in to where you know,
*  how that moves and let's fucking go and just bust that motherfucker out for the
*  whole world. And you don't have to do editing. That I'll tell you,
*  I fucking hate. It's the worst. You know,
*  the last one they called me and they go,
*  so we're going to have to change your release date because you won't watch this.
*  Yeah. I always have that problem. I don't want to watch me. I know either.
*  I don't want to. I fucking hated it. Yeah. And then I,
*  then I told them I wanted the show that they were like, no, not that. I go, yeah,
*  no, I want this show. And they were like, what about the other show?
*  I don't want that show. And then everyone was like,
*  I go you asked me to fucking watch it. I watched. Well, that's gotta be,
*  you can't have anybody giving you advice. I don't, I don't agree.
*  I think if a comic is going to put out a special,
*  it should be that comic special and whether that comic thing should be on that
*  special. And that's it. I don't want no,
*  I remember Robbie and Bill Burr were arguing in the parking lot of the comic
*  store and Robbie was drunk and Bill Burr was like, Hey,
*  I'm not going to fucking argue with you about what my fucking act is.
*  Why you're drunk at the comedy store. It was this like incredible moment.
*  I'm like, yeah, that's how it's supposed to be.
*  You're not supposed to have someone tell you what the fuck you're going to put
*  in your act. Like, do you know how to do comedy? No, you don't do comedy, right?
*  Shut the fuck up. You shut the fuck up. This is crazy.
*  This is a crazy conversation. Yeah, it's, I mean,
*  but everybody wants to get in there. That's the problem with,
*  like if you were doing your show, that's a problem with doing anything.
*  Like imagine if you did your mom's house and you had a bunch of people you were
*  working for. It's a great analogy. I mean, yes.
*  Especially your mom's house live. Oh my God. No, well, yeah, that wouldn't work.
*  Which I was at fear factor for six years and I fucking gagged so hard watching
*  that show. I had to turn away three or four times.
*  I tried. I heaved a lot doing that. It's so gross. I know you're right.
*  I mean, no one would let you do it, but yet it's hugely successful.
*  It's totally true. I mean, notes wise, I'll say this, like, you know,
*  cause I experienced this with the, with the book. I wrote a book, you know,
*  a year ago or whatever is like the first time you get notes on anything,
*  a script or anything, you're like, what the fuck is this? Right.
*  And then when you do encounter notes of value,
*  cause there are notes that are sure that you go like, that was a good,
*  that was a good note. You have to be able to balance cause what ends up happening,
*  the way that really I think handle it is you, you listen to all of them,
*  but you also have to be able to go, I, I hear what you're saying on this.
*  And I totally disagree. You can't wait. It's hard to do when you're like,
*  starting out, right? It's impossible. You just can't,
*  but once you kind of know yourself and what you're trying to do,
*  you get to go like, Oh yeah, that's a good, I know what you're going for there.
*  I don't want to do that. Right. And so I'm not. Yeah.
*  But your other note was great.
*  And I could you imagine if like you decided that like doing your mom's house was
*  too difficult. So you're going to bring in some Hollywood executives to help you,
*  some actual Hollywood producers that do like keeping up with the Kardashians or
*  something. And they're going to,
*  they're going to help you produce your mom's house.
*  I mean, I had the fucking that's so far fetched that like, you know,
*  it's like, it would be such a fucking shit show. It would be terrible.
*  It would be terrible. But isn't it interesting that it's so popular? Yeah.
*  That like, but people once it becomes popular,
*  then they would want to get in on it. And here's how we can make it better.
*  Yeah. Tighten it up. Yeah. Figure out a way to make it.
*  Imagine somebody telling you how to run this thing. It'd be impossible.
*  I can't even take, I don't even,
*  when someone asks me to put someone on,
*  even if I would want to put that person on now, I don't want to put them on.
*  Just because they asked you. Yeah. I don't, I don't want it.
*  I don't want to get into that.
*  I only want to have people on the show that I want to have on the show.
*  And that's it. That's the only way I've ever done it.
*  It's the only way I want to do it.
*  Somebody asked me just like a week ago, a guy stopped me and he was like,
*  I have a question about podcasting. I go, what? He goes, how do you,
*  what's the like criteria for asking someone to be a guest?
*  And I go, what do you mean? He goes like, what, like, what do you check off?
*  And I go, somebody I want to talk to. Yeah. Like that's the, he goes,
*  that's it. I go, that's it. That's it. That's what I want to do.
*  That's the beautiful thing about what we're doing.
*  The beautiful thing about today,
*  there's never been a time like that where something can reach fucking millions
*  and millions of people. And it's just, I want to talk to that guy. Yeah.
*  Like this guy doesn't think the moon landing is real. Come on in,
*  come in here. That fucking hummus cannon guy on
*  nutty dude.
*  And the funny thing is we were exchanging videos of him before. Like,
*  remember we were like, look at this guy. Is that guy for real?
*  Like what do you think is going on? So that's really who he is. That's who he is.
*  You sure there's not like a little bit of, he understands.
*  He gets Will Blunderfeld. He gets that there's
*  an angle with, with, with which people are seeing this through.
*  And he understands the humor in it,
*  but it's based in for him an authentic point of view for sure.
*  So he's trying to get straight guys to do gay stuff.
*  He would say that's fucking gay or to not do that stuff.
*  This is spartan mentality.
*  The straightest thing you can do is fill another guy up with cum.
*  Yeah.
*  What's funny about that is that that used to be how warriors live.
*  That's what he talks about all the time.
*  And he's pretty well versed in like spartan history, samurai,
*  and he'll know these like, he's like, here's, here's the literature. He'll,
*  he'll show you. Like, I think, look, the, the real,
*  if you want to like break down what he's doing,
*  I think a big part of what he's doing is trying to trick guys into fucking them.
*  That's one big one of them. The other one is, you know,
*  shedding this masculinity is only this. Like that's like the origin of it,
*  right? That like, that, you know,
*  you don't have to be this way in order to be Matt or like guys are whatever.
*  So many guys are super homophobic is like the,
*  that's like the footsteps of all this starting. And then I think, you know,
*  I think he's very aware of humor and he has to be, he totally calls his dick a
*  hummus cannon. It's great. I mean, yeah. And yeah, your wonderful starfish,
*  receptacle or something. Yeah. Whatever he says. Yeah. Um,
*  your dirt hole. Yeah. Yeah.
*  I saw all types of where you got to lick each other's nipples.
*  If you're a real man. Yeah. But yeah, he, he knows what he's doing.
*  I think he knows what he's doing.
*  How many guys are sucking his dick because of those videos?
*  A couple that have probably been like, am I straight now? I just,
*  I didn't, you said, um, I don't know, man.
*  That's the thing. Like if someone gets enough followers, there's going to be,
*  you know, out of every 1000 people,
*  there's a guy that you can talk into a being in a cult.
*  My favorite is this guy right now, a fancy chef, uh, where he's like,
*  he's, he's just post. I haven't sent you fancy chef videos.
*  He's just like in his kitchen and he's in a chef's outfit with the hat.
*  And then he's just, he's, he'll, he'll put like strawberries in a glass.
*  He's like, beautiful and nice. Look at this. Look at the shit I just made.
*  You just put strawberries in a glass, but he keeps, he's like, book me,
*  call me right now. Millionaires and billionaires only.
*  And he does this whole pitch about how he's like a world-class chef.
*  And you just keep watching. You're like, am I getting trolled or is this,
*  what's going on? Is this a delusional person or is this a subtle troll?
*  That's exactly what you do. And then the more you watch, you're like, oh no,
*  he's delusional for sure. But meanwhile,
*  being delusional can get you pretty fucking far. It can, it can. And like,
*  so he's cooking food. What's the food on the left? A left right there.
*  What is that? What does he got going on there? I can't hear it.
*  Looks like chicken.
*  That's beautiful. Beautiful and nice.
*  That's going to give you the flavor. Love. That's beautiful.
*  Well, he just laid fucking time on top of it.
*  I don't know that that's going to do anything.
*  And he goes between this. There's a lot of wine glasses.
*  Like he's always putting something in a glass and then
*  look at the top comment day two 38 of not knowing whether this channel is satire.
*  Like it's like,
*  Jamie, I'm going to send you a guy that I'm addicted to.
*  I'm addicted to this dude. It's a BS dining experience.
*  And all this dude does is deep fry food. That's it.
*  But it just does it with enthusiasm outdoors. Give me some volume.
*  Go down and get the chicken, not the snake. The snake's disgusting.
*  Go down and get some of that chicken. Listen to this.
*  Yes. You know,
*  yeah. He baptizes it in the grease. Everything's gets.
*  That's a lot of chicken. Oh yeah. He's cooking for like parties. Watch this.
*  Watch this. Watch this. Watch this.
*  You mentioned how good that is, dude. Oh my God. I get so hungry.
*  And watch when he puts it out,
*  watch. He pulls it out. Oh my God.
*  Seven minutes. We're going to drop the next batch.
*  And they come on. Come on. Look at that. Look at that.
*  I'll see y'all in batch number two.
*  And he does this with everything. He does it with fish. Like go to,
*  go back to his page, to his actual page so you could see all the different.
*  Yeah. So he's got all kinds of shit. Like look, he's doing crabs and fish.
*  Look at this. It's all deep fried. Terrible for you.
*  It looks amazing. He's got waffles and everything.
*  If you were like, what's, what's the decadent thing you kind of want to indulge
*  in where I'm like, when it's done well,
*  I don't know that anything is makes me happier. Fried chicken,
*  fried chicken at Roscoe's with waffles, with butter and syrup.
*  And you get a little piece of the chicken, a little piece of the waffle.
*  Sensational.
*  Fried chicken where the crisp is done perfectly and the chicken isn't dry.
*  Like it's still moist.
*  That's why that guy's stuff looks so good. Oh my God. Like a juicy fried chicken.
*  Oh yeah. I don't know. There's anything more satisfying.
*  I got Colonel Sanders the other day. Yeah. Not the other day,
*  about seven months ago I was just driving and I was hungry.
*  Like chicken's probably pretty safe. Let me pull in, get some fried chicken.
*  It just tasted like poison. Yeah. Yeah. I was like, what's in this?
*  What kind of oil are you guys using? When was the last time you cleaned the oil?
*  At KFC. A random KFC in the middle of nowhere.
*  So I've had some KFC that's really good. Like there used to be a KFC in Woodland
*  Hills. I used to get every now and then I wanted to cheat.
*  I go in there and get some fucking bucket of chicken. Let's go. It's so good.
*  Yeah. So good with hot sauce on it. Oh baby. But this one was terrible.
*  Do you have an unnatural tolerance for hot sauce? Don't you? Yes.
*  Is this genetic? I think it is. Cause my daughter has it.
*  I have one daughter that you haven't like trained up to it or you have kind of.
*  I think I've trained up to it too. Yeah. But one daughter is like,
*  one daughter just can take anything. She's fine. Yeah. She loves it.
*  She's like really hot stuff. Like I brought her some of that senior Lechuga.
*  I have a partnership with senior Lechuga.
*  We make some crazy hot sauce with like Reapers in it and it's potent.
*  She's just no problem. So that is kind of, that's it. It has to be genetic.
*  Cause I've been with you and I've been like, what are you talking about?
*  And you're like, that's fine. I'm like, that's not fine. No one else is fine.
*  Yeah. I'd fuck up that hot wing show. I can, I can get down.
*  I think you would. I can get down. Yeah. He's the best. I love Sean Evans.
*  He's great. I just don't want to answer questions while I'm eating hot sauce.
*  Yeah. Well that doesn't make any sense, but I can get down with some ferocious shit.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I've seen it. I'm like, this can't just be like natural.
*  No, no. Like it's natural, but I'm saying that's not everybody. No,
*  I think there's some genetic and then there's some buildup to it, but I like it.
*  I like, I like, I like a, I like a, I like kick, but I don't like that.
*  I like really, I like, and you don't feel like it.
*  I start sweating. My daughter makes fun of me cause I literally pouring down my
*  face. She's like, what the fuck is wrong with you? Like your head.
*  I start sweating, but I start sweating way lower. My clothes are wet. Like
*  everything. I love it on eggs. Oh yeah. Yeah.
*  I put senior lechuga on my eggs this morning. I had eggs with a elk sausage for
*  breakfast. Ooh, baby. You want some milk sausage? I got some. Yes. Ooh,
*  I hook you up. Really? Yeah. Yeah. I'm gonna leave here. I'll give you a bunch.
*  Okay. I got a commercial freezer back there. Okay.
*  Oh, elk sausage is so good. And it's just like ready to frozen. Is it? Yep.
*  Frozen. And I got this jalapeno cheddar.
*  What's the best way to prepare that elk sausage? I like it on a skillet. Okay.
*  I like it. I do it on a Traeger too. I do it on the pellet grill.
*  That's good too. You get it to a certain temperature. I like that too.
*  I do it real slow.
*  I do it like 225 degrees and get it up to like 134 internal and then pull it.
*  But it's as long as you don't overcook it because they do add like a little bit
*  of pork fat when they make it for me.
*  Cause I get it prepared at like a butcher shop,
*  but you do you're dealing with a much leaner meat. It's, you know,
*  you can dry it out. Yeah. You can dry it out. You know,
*  there's like a fine line you want it like right where medium rare.
*  I love using my, my pellet grill. Oh, pellet grills are great. That's great.
*  Yeah. And they're so easy. I got the newest Traeger. I had the old one,
*  but the newest one is so much better. It's incredible. Really? Yeah.
*  It's just, it makes everything smokier. The effect is better.
*  The flavor is better. It's easier to use.
*  It's got two different probes for temperature.
*  It's just like it alerts you on your app.
*  You can lower and raise the temperature on the app.
*  I know I went out. Yeah. I mean, like I left the house with the boys. Just check.
*  Yeah. You see the temperature of the food.
*  You can see the temperature of the grill and you can say, you know,
*  is it getting a little close? Let me drop that bitch down to 180. Yeah.
*  And bang. It's incredible. Yeah. Well, it's just so easy to use.
*  I still like an offset smoker too, though. I got,
*  I have a real offset smoker that I got. That is better.
*  The thing about the real offset smoker, it's much more of a pain in the ass,
*  but there's certain sugars that you get from the wood,
*  the wood itself, like a real piece of mesquite,
*  a real piece of post oak and you set a little fire underneath there with little
*  sticks and you get it built up and then you dial it in with the dampers.
*  It's like a thing. It's like a lot of work. Yeah.
*  But the flavor is even more intense.
*  I know I get so seduced by these videos of people doing things and I found this,
*  I forget what company it is makes this like Argentine. I got one of those too.
*  Grill works. The wheel it over the fire and I like, I want one of those.
*  Grill works. Yeah. Go to grill works. I want one of those dude. Grill works. Ben,
*  he, he hooked me up and I, I had one installed at my house,
*  but it's the same thing cranking up. That is great. Just stakes. Yeah.
*  Just like watching that video. Oh yeah. Cause it's the same thing.
*  You're just using hardwoods. You just got hardwood cooking.
*  You get those flames rising up. Look at that. Look at that. There's a place.
*  Oh, this is, this is the thing that I'm looking up. Yeah, exactly. Well,
*  that's our place. The place in Vegas. This is our meats. Jose Andres's place.
*  That's what they use. I want one of these that I'll get you. I'll hook you up.
*  Really? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'll have that guy make you one. Fuck. Yes.
*  You'll love it. They're the shit. They're the shit. Oh yeah. It's incredible.
*  And they have a bunch of different ones.
*  They can either do a custom build or they can just have one like that.
*  It's already made. They rolled into your backyard. Yeah. Fucking incredible.
*  That's so cool. And if you dial it in, right.
*  If you use meat probes and you slowly cook it and then sear it at the end,
*  nothing better. It has that flavor. Like that place, bizarre meats in Vegas.
*  Shout out to Jose. Shout out to Jose. Andres is the shit.
*  Bro. How crazy was what happened to him in Israel?
*  With, uh, with his world central kitchen. Yeah. Yeah.
*  It looks like they targeted them. It's horrible, man.
*  Didn't they kill like six people? A bunch of people died. Yeah.
*  Who are just trying to feed refugees. It fucking sucks. How crazy is that?
*  It sucks. And those guys are just, they go, people don't know.
*  World central kitchen just goes anywhere. There's a disaster. Yeah. Hurricane,
*  tornadoes, you know, earthquakes, war zones, invasion of Ukraine.
*  They were setting up outside. They're just like people need to eat.
*  There's not, they're not like politically siding with anyone.
*  They're just feeding people. They're not even publicizing it.
*  He's just doing it and then people write stories about the fact that he's doing
*  it. It's incredible. He's genuine. He's like, there's,
*  there's genuine people that are really filled with like real philanthropy,
*  like really want to help people. And that's that guy. And his food is insane.
*  That bizarre meats in Vegas is like so underrated.
*  And he has a one in DC starts with a J I forget. It's so fucking good.
*  All Spanish. Like always like his food.
*  I think he's got one in Chicago too. Yeah. He's got a bunch, but they're, yeah,
*  he, he doesn't miss that dude's food is amazing. He's the best. Tommy Buns.
*  You're the fucking man. Thanks for doing this brother. Yeah, of course.
*  So when your show comes out, come back and do it again. I would love to.
*  Thank you so much. My pleasure. All right. All right. Bye everybody.

*  boxers, Michael Jordan. Nope. Not yet.
