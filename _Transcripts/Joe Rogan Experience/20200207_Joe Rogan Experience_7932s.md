# Joe Rogan Experience #1425 - Garrett Reisman
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [February 07, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RG5pXTpLBI)
*  3, 2, 1, welcome! Thanks for doing this man, I really appreciate it.
*  Thanks for inviting me, this is awesome. I've seen a bunch of videos online of you
*  talking about space and your dream of being an astronaut as a young man and
*  what is it like just to see the earth from above and to be... you lived up there
*  for like what, 95 days? 95 days, which actually is kind of a bummer to be
*  honest with you because you know this if you saw that video maybe, but the
*  thing is if you stay for a hundred days they give you a patch, right? And I'm at
*  day 95 and the space shuttle Discovery shows up to bring me home and Mark Kelly
*  was a commander, he goes Garrett it's time to hop in and come home and I'm like
*  man I just need five more days. To get that patch. Can't we just like go around a few more
*  times or something? Yeah, it seems like 95 days should be enough man, give the
*  man a patch. Right, right, how much does a patch cost? What's the longest anybody
*  stayed up there? The longest for an American was Scott Kelly's nearly a year
*  in space, his longest in a row basically, but it was a Russian that stayed up
*  there for longer than a year and he has the all-time record. How, and they, when
*  they come back, like what is 90 days like coming back? Because I've talked to
*  people who've gone there when they come back their balance is all off, the
*  equilibrium is all screwy. Yeah, you're kind of, it's, you're kind of messed up and in your
*  vestibular system is what's affected the most, at least that's what's most
*  noticeable when you first get back. Actually the first thing I noticed, let
*  me back up, is how heavy things were again, you know? So like I took off my
*  helmet and I was holding it in my hand and it felt like I was holding the anchor
*  to the USS Nimitz, you know? It's like, I'm like how am I ever gonna brush my teeth
*  it'd be like too arduous, you know? Does your body severely weaken in 95 days?
*  Well back in the day, back when I was going there, so that mission, my long term
*  mission was back in 2008 and back then we were still losing bone density and
*  muscle mass as we're going up there. About, you lost about 1% of bone every
*  month, so I was about 3% low. They don't anymore? They don't anymore because we
*  found out, we came up with better countermeasures to prevent that. What are
*  the countermeasures? It's basically working out and it's resistive exercise
*  that does it for you, which we knew back when I was going, but the problem was we
*  had this machine that was kind of a first generation of the
*  workout machine and it could do large reps but low load, so you're doing like a
*  lot of reps at low weight and that helped, but what helps, it turns out
*  we found this out kind of by happenstance, but it turns out that high
*  load, low reps works much better. So we got this new machine that you could
*  really crank it up to 11 and the guys now that are working out on that
*  thing are coming home with no muscle or bone loss at all. Wow, that's
*  what's the Canadian gentleman that we had on? Yes, Chris Hatfield.
*  When Commander Hatfield came back, I believe he said it took him a whole
*  year to recover. Yeah, I mean that was still like in the early, still kind of
*  in the early days, so I don't know which machine he used. He probably did use a
*  new one, but overall it does take to get everything back, to get your full
*  vestibular system back, your sense of balance, to get your all your bone, all
*  your muscle back to baseline. It took me a year to get all that back too. Wow. It's
*  kind of like rehabbing from a major sports injury. That's gotta be so
*  strange. Your body just wants to shrivel up when you're up there because there's
*  no gravity. Yeah, it's really interesting because it's an adaptation and
*  the body is incredible. So what it's doing is it's realizing, hey, you know, I
*  don't have to carry my own weight anymore, so why do I need this big bulky
*  skeleton? Wow. It's like you're becoming kind of like a fish where you're
*  shedding all the bone density because you don't have to, your body
*  realizes I don't need it. It's like a fish in water, you know, they have fish
*  have very slender bones. That's an interesting way to look at it, like a
*  fish. Yeah. Wow. And we fight it by working out. And how often do you have to work
*  out? Every day? Every day. How often? Like how much time? They schedule
*  two hours. Now you're not on the machine for two hours, so that's also prepping,
*  you know, getting changed and you know cleaning up afterwards, but so you're
*  working out a good hour every day. What is it like to sweat in space? It's weird
*  because what happens is if you don't notice, like in the beginning you don't
*  even realize it, but it's all building up and even without like if you have no
*  hair to soak it up, it just builds up like this thin film of water on your
*  head, like a coating of water, and you don't even notice it because it doesn't
*  run down. And then somebody calls your name and you're like yeah and then
*  Pshhh. Oh that's crazy, I never even thought of that. So it just kind of
*  floats off your body. Yeah it's like a dog shaking itself, you know, and it just
*  goes everywhere. So if you have it on your arm you can kind of just go pshhh and
*  the sweat will go flying. You know your crewmates won't be too happy with you
*  if you do this a lot, but yeah. Wow. Oh that's it. Is there video of people doing
*  that in space? There's gotta be. There should be. We've shot so much video somebody's
*  gotta have done that, but. So are you basically doing like compound movements
*  like deadlifts and squats and things along those lines? Yeah, functional
*  fitness kind of stuff where, but and you're focusing on certain areas, so the
*  bone loss comes mostly from your legs because you're not loading. So basically
*  our bones need a stimulus to regenerate and it happens to us every day. So as you
*  walk, as you go upstairs, that load that the bones feel, the compressive load is
*  telling the bone hey make some more. Now you take that away and the bone stops
*  making more and that's the problem. People say like can't you just take like
*  calcium pills but it's not a mineral deficiency. It's just there's no load.
*  That's interesting the the body adapts so quickly. Yeah. That 90 days it has such
*  and if you didn't do anything for 90 days at all you'd be in real trouble
*  right? Yeah that's what's really kind of freaky is they thinking about like well
*  what if we don't fight this? Because all these adaptations you go through are not
*  a problem when you're in space. It's only a problem if you want to come home. Right.
*  Right. Losing that bone even like not using your vestibular organs anymore,
*  your semicircular canals, your otolith organs. You're not making use of those
*  for your balance. You're just going purely on the visual. What that does
*  initially is it make you kind of sick. You get kind of it's like being air sick
*  or seasick but once your body adapts you're fine. So the question is like what
*  would we become if we didn't fight it? What if we just went with it and stayed
*  up there? Be like a water balloon. What would you become? Right. You'd become
*  actually the place I think in science fiction that gets it the most correct is
*  if you watch The Expanse. You ever watch that show? No I heard it's a really good
*  show. I never got into it though. It's good and they get it right because they
*  show people like these belters that live in partial gravity like their whole
*  lives and they have much more slender bones and like they catch this like
*  terrorist guy and they want to torture him and all they do is they make him
*  stand up in gravity and on earth and it's incredibly painful for him. Oh wow.
*  Yeah that would probably be what would happen. And it must take a long ass time
*  to get everything back. If you went from earth's gravity to the space station and
*  you lived up there for a year and didn't do anything about it and then came back
*  to earth you'd basically be like it would be hard to crawl right? Yeah you
*  would you're all your if you don't try to fight it you the vestibular stuff
*  would come back probably about the same rate but you would be really hurting
*  with your muscle atrophy and your bone so you would you would lose a lot of your
*  skeleton if you're up there for a year and did nothing and you would also your
*  all your muscles that you don't use like in your legs and your postural muscles
*  so in your lower back you're not using those anymore so they would just like
*  waste away to nothing. You'd be okay in your arms because you're doing everything
*  you're everything you do is with your arms that's how you move that's how you
*  get around is by pulling and pushing but you don't you know there's no walking
*  there's no stairs there's nothing. Does it affect the way you think at all?
*  You know some people describe a kind of an issue with short-term memory they
*  call it like space brain. Boy is that a small group of people that would understand
*  what you're talking about there. I got space brain bro I got that too.
*  So it's something that I never really noticed it but I don't know how much of
*  that is real and how much is like like you're freaking out because you're in
*  space right so it's distracting and maybe you forget like what that number
*  was you're supposed to remember but you know like if you're really in the middle
*  of something and you're all excited and or and and and you kind of can't
*  remember somebody's phone number it's kind of like kind of like that.
*  Okay so it's just well I would imagine that just being up there breathing that
*  recirculated air it's got to be odd right? Yeah and it might stink but I don't
*  know because the other thing that happens is you have this big fluid shift
*  so right now we have a lot of blood pooling up in our legs and our our heart
*  its most important job of course is to feed the brain oxygenated blood and then
*  when you take the gravity vector out of the picture the heart sends too much up
*  to the brain and the stuff doesn't collect in our legs anymore and it all
*  shoots up here and you get the shift of all that blood volume to your upper body
*  and your head gets all puffed up. Whoa. Yeah like so my first night in space I
*  went to sleep which is kind of hard to do because you're in space you don't
*  want to go to sleep right? Yeah. And on that first night I woke up in the middle
*  of the night and I could have sworn I was standing on my head doing a head
*  stand or a handstand I'm like why am I standing on my head in my sleep this is
*  strange right? And then I looked at the window I saw the earth I'm like oh that's
*  right I'm in space. So all the blood was just kind of pooling in your head. Yeah.
*  As if you're like hanging by gravity boots or something. It feels exactly like
*  that. Wow. And then after a day or two you get used to it and it doesn't bother
*  you anymore but you feel congested because you still have all this volume
*  up here. So your sense of smell and your sense of taste are all deadened. Wow.
*  It's kind of like yeah so it's kind of like when you have a cold and your
*  sense of smell and your sense of taste are like not as strong. So it's like that
*  all the time that's why we take we cover we have every hot sauce known to humankind
*  up on the space station. Oh really? We got Sriracha, we got you know Louisiana Cajun fire sauce and
*  whatever. We got like a whole stockpile of it because you pour that on everything so you can get some taste.
*  Because otherwise everything tastes really bland. Oh wow. Now what are you eating up there? Oh it's terrible.
*  Is it freeze-dried foods mostly? Yeah you don't go for the food all right? This is not like a foodie holiday.
*  So you got basically two choices. You have the American food which is essentially MREs like
*  military freeze-dried irradiated you know infinite shelf life kind of stuff. And then the Russian food
*  is also based on their military rations but from submarines. And the Russian food actually tastes
*  better but the problem is one of presentation because it comes in cans. So you get these cans
*  and even though it tastes good you open that can up and you look at it and it's like God looks like dog food.
*  There's like congealed and yeah but it tastes better. It tastes better but it's just like so
*  unappetizing when you open that can up and you know it's just not. What would happen if you
*  brought fresh things up there? Would they rot at the same rate that they would rot in America?
*  Oh yeah the thing is we have no refrigeration. We didn't when I was there. They actually have a small
*  refrigerator now. So you can't have anything that needs to be refrigerated. But you would usually
*  like for the first couple days we take a bag of fresh food and we took like sandwiches and fruits
*  and vegetables and stuff. And then because that's the last time you're gonna have it. After that it's
*  all gonna be just the stuff in the packets that you had water to. Now the first day you actually
*  got up there was that the first time you had ever been in space? On my first mission yeah the first
*  time in space. So your first view of the earth from above? Yeah was that right there? What is
*  that like? Wow well I didn't see it right away because I was in the mid-deck the downstairs of
*  the shuttle and there's only one window down there and it's in the corner okay so it's in the hatch
*  and it's like the size of a dinner plate. And I was up there you got a lot of work to do when you
*  as soon as you get up there. So I'm working like crazy and after about 30 minutes I see this pale
*  blue glow coming from that window and I'm like that's the earth you know I should have a look
*  at that and I was super excited for this you know. So I wanted to be ready so I paused I closed my
*  eyes I've meditated you know call it whatever you want I just got ready and when I felt like
*  I was ready I floated up to that window and I opened up my eyes and I gazed out for the very
*  first time at the earth from space and what that felt like is really really hard to describe in
*  words but if I had to pick one word to describe what I was feeling at that moment it would be meh.
*  Really? Yeah man. Just meh. Just meh I mean it was alright it was pretty it had a lot like those
*  earth colors like blues and greens. Right. But man we've all seen pictures of the earth from
*  space okay I mean we got like HD video coming down from space now where it's just spectacular
*  you can see stuff in that video that you can't even see with your own eyes like the aurora and
*  all that. And I'm sure like John Glenn and like Yuri Gagarin had no idea what to expect and so
*  when they looked out and they saw the earth they freaked out you know and it was amazing and it was
*  beautiful but it was it was underwhelming I guess my expectations were so high. Like I felt like
*  there should be like some heavenly choir and then we should all hold hands and sing kumba. Yeah.
*  Most people that have done it they talk about this realization that you like this inescapable
*  realization that we're all on this thing together and that all these boundaries of civilizations and
*  cultures and countries and continents are all nonsense we're really just all in this one thing
*  together. Yeah they call that the overview effect and a lot of guys come back and talk about that
*  and they really feel it and they talk about a world without borders and you know and it's a
*  beautiful sentiment and I don't I don't want to knock that in any way but yeah like really a world
*  without borders what'd you expect to see you expect to look down and see like dotted lines between all
*  the countries you know really. You know I guess you do it's inescapable when you look down and
*  you see the planet and you realize that we're all in the same boat you know but that didn't strike
*  me as a sudden realization because I think it's because I knew that before I went you shouldn't
*  have to go and strap into a rocket and blast off and look at the earth and know that basically we're
*  all human beings I think I mean I think the things that unite us are so much stronger and
*  more important than the crazy little things that divide us like race or sex or nationality or
*  politics or whatever and at the end of the day we have this one home and and we're all stuck here
*  in it together so I had that strong knowledge before I went and maybe that's why when I look
*  down I'm like yeah there it is okay I get it hmm but it wasn't like all of a sudden like the
*  the the shade was pulled back and there is like suddenly a new realization about life. Is there
*  one place that's the spot on the space station to get the view where you really got a big window?
*  There's this huge window called the cupola that wasn't there in my first mission but it was there
*  in my second mission so I got to see it the second time. They added a window? Yeah. How do you add a
*  window to the space station? You just you know get the you know it's a they added a whole module
*  and the module had this cupola which is like is that it right there is that what you're looking
*  through? That's exactly it yeah. Wow. So this that's pretty tight. It's like a it's a dome and so you
*  get the full 360 view and it's spectacular. Wow. And we tell the guys that don't get to do a space
*  walk that this view is just as good as doing a space walk. But it's not. It's not. It's not. But
*  don't tell them because it makes them feel better. They're gonna listen. What is a space walk like? Oh
*  man. Well first I gotta tell you that the likelihood of me doing a space walk was like slim to none.
*  When I first got there they tell you that when you're interviewing to become an astronaut to go talk
*  to some of the other astronauts and so I went in there and we had this presentation about space
*  walking and it seemed like to be the like the ultimate experience. Just an incredible thing and
*  I wanted to do it bad. So I went I'm talking to this one astronaut who's a pretty tall guy.
*  Those of you that can't tell from the podcast I'm 5'4 okay so I'm not like not like a real towering
*  individual. A little vertically challenged I guess. And I'm talking to this real tall astronaut and I
*  said you know just heard about the space walking. Sounds awesome. I want I've been living in
*  California. I've been doing like some rock climbing, some scuba diving. Maybe that'd make me a good
*  candidate to do a space walk. And this tall astronaut looked at me like right in the eye
*  and he laughed in my face. He said what are you? Four foot what? How rude. I know. My first thought
*  was you know I thought astronauts are supposed to be polite and this guy like was not being nice
*  but he was he was actually just being brutally honest you know it's kind of tough love and he
*  was like listen the suit is one size fits all. You're going to get in that thing and it's going
*  to swallow you up and you're not going to be able to do anything. You're going to be useless.
*  So this is impossible. Forget about it. So I was kind of pissed off but but I wasn't going to let
*  this guy stop me right. So I get there. I got the job and I go down for my first training exercise
*  which was in this huge pool we got in Houston and it's like it's 100 feet wide 200 feet long
*  40 feet deep and we can fit like most of the space station in there and they get a crane that comes
*  by they put you in the suit which weighs you know something like 175 pounds and stuff with you
*  and then in addition you're in it too. It picks you up and it plop you in the water and you float
*  around and it's kind of like being up in space and that's how we train. So I get down there's
*  my very first exercise and I could tell in the first five minutes of this training exercise
*  that big tall astronaut that laughed in my face was right.
*  I was not I was failing. I was I was not doing well. I was uh I was screwing up. I was like
*  it just wasn't going well. Why do they make a one-size-fits-all suit? It seems they have
*  the ability to alter the arms and the legs a little bit and they have um it's actually three
*  different size upper torsos. There's a there's a medium a large and an extra large but that's
*  it. It's limited and because it costs a lot of money to make different sizes so there's only
*  the gloves that can tailor because that's actually the most important thing.
*  But I'm I'm getting my butt kicked you know and I and I got a needs improvement which is a NASA
*  nice way of saying you failed right but I wasn't ready to give up. I went and uh I knew I was going
*  to need help so I talked to um the people that make the suit and they did some of those things
*  so like they shorten up the arms they fix it up a little bit for me and then I talked to the
*  trainers and we said okay yeah we got to think outside the box here if we give you the standard
*  procedure you're going to be at a disadvantage but maybe we change your body positions instead
*  of going straight on to the work site maybe we come at the work site from the side so you get
*  more reached that way and we started working at it and we got better and better and the end of the
*  story is that uh I got to eventually I got the highest possible qualification to do the most
*  complicated spacewalks we do and I ended up doing three different spacewalks over the course of my
*  career and that big tall guy that laughed in my face he didn't get to do any yeah.
*  That's what you get for talking shit sir. Look at you out there. Yeah that's me. Now what is that
*  feeling like because it's got to feel insane when you're strapped to a space station that's
*  floating around and you're just hanging by a cord. Yeah well you're holding on tight
*  you do have that safety tether that you see there and uh you know they can prepare you for
*  everything except for the visual so when you like are in the pool you're staring at the pool wall
*  when you get up there and you see the whole earth below you some people go out there
*  and get like a sense of fear of falling um but of course if you let go you're not going anywhere.
*  Right. The space station is moving 17,500 miles an hour but so are you so it's kind of like doing
*  the wing wing walking on an airplane but with no air to blow you off the wing so when you look at
*  the space station it's rock solid but you look down and some people get the fear of falling and
*  and then they hold on real tight which is a terrible terrible mistake because we call it space walking
*  but you're not walking you're doing everything with your arms. So you can wear your arms out.
*  Exactly. So now if you're climbing and you get like kind of totally thrashed in your forearms and
*  now you get that claw hand and it's useless yeah you can do that and you got like seven and a half
*  hours to go and that's bad. So you're out there for seven and a half hours? Yeah. What if you have to pee?
*  Diaper. Diaper? Yeah. Poop as well? Try to avoid that. You do your best? I uh
*  as a as a scientist I had to experiment right? Of course. So during a training exercise I waited
*  to like the very end just in case you know and I let one go uh right before they pulled me out of
*  the pool one day and I resolved never ever to do that again. Is that number one or number two?
*  Oh boy. Number one is no big deal. Yeah I saved that project. I would have I could have told you
*  what was going to happen that's disgusting and you're doing it in the pool too you're not doing
*  it in actual space space. Yeah. To be one of the rare people that it's actually pooped
*  in space would be very interesting. That's it that's you know we keep all these records I don't know
*  who's got that record it's not me. Diaper. Yeah. Boy. So you just have to let it go when you're up
*  there. Yeah. So what are you doing when you're out there? So if you're doing seven and a half
*  hours worth of work? You're basically doing maintenance so it's kind of like being a mechanic
*  or a technician the way I describe it but the suit is like so hard it restricts everything you do
*  because it's blown up to about four pounds per square inch and so even just closing your fists
*  takes work because the suit's like a balloon it wants to stay like this and so just closing your
*  fingers is takes effort and over seven and a half hours that gets really fatiguing. You're moving
*  your arms everything is and the suit can only move like you can't do this right you can do this maybe
*  so your your your ability to raise up your shoulders is really limited so you're trying
*  to do all this work but you're working inside the suit and I describe it as like it's like trying
*  to change the oil in your car while wearing a medieval suit of armor. It's hard. And what
*  what kind of maintenance are you doing on the outside of the spaceship? Oh you know we're
*  cleaning the windows getting the bugs off and like no we're uh oh yeah that's another on this
*  particular spacewalk we're assembling a robot that we took up there but we did other things like we
*  put a new antenna on top of the space station we um swapped out a bunch of batteries that were
*  getting old um you know stuff like that. That's fascinating so you have to you have to have some
*  real understanding of mechanical things as well. Yeah. I mean you're putting stuff together.
*  Yeah exactly I mean you uh it really helps to have some kind of mechanical aptitude I mean a lot of
*  us like working on our cars or building things in our garage you know hobbyist kind of stuff.
*  We actually started right as I was leaving NASA which was back in 2010 we started like kind of
*  an informal program where we're we're like going over these others garages and doing car repair
*  stuff just to get more hands-on experience uh with that kind of thing. So when like say if you have
*  to do an antenna up there is that something you're trained for on earth in the pool and then you go
*  up there and do it? During the shuttle days absolutely everything we did was choreographed
*  down to like exactly where I'm going to put what handrail I'm going to put my toolbox on. I mean
*  everything is all figured out in advance but nowadays and sometimes on space station even
*  when I was there when things break you don't have the luxury of training. If we're going to do a
*  shuttle mission we're doing a really complex spacewalk we'll do everything we're going to do
*  in space at least 10 times in the pool first but these days you don't have that luxury something
*  breaks and you you brief you brief it you talk about it you you you have some power points and
*  then you're out the door and you got to go do it. So how much briefing and how many power points?
*  The training that goes on prior to one of these unscheduled EVAs is um you know typically on the
*  order of like a day's worth of activity all told. So are these power points pre-loaded onto the
*  space station and you get it or they have to beam it up to you? It depends on exactly what you're
*  what you're doing so we identify like the most likely and most serious things that could go wrong
*  and we practice those in the pool and we have all those procedures suitcase before we ever go
*  but then sometimes you get a surprise you know sometimes something breaks you weren't expecting
*  to break or breaks in a certain way or there's a complication that you weren't planning on
*  and then you got to improvise. Wow that's got to be crazy because I mean and you're probably doing
*  things that other people on the space station maybe haven't done so there's no one that can
*  tell you hey I did it's no big deal. Yeah but you know even if you're doing something that you
*  rehearsed 10 times and you think you got it all figured out you still get surprised when you
*  actually get up there. The big one that I remember is on my second spacewalk we're connecting this
*  dish antenna and it had to go on top of this big boom like a big pedestal and there was a connector
*  that had an electrical connector and we had like an hour or so to connect the thing and without
*  it connected it wasn't getting any power or data to that antenna and it could get too cold and this
*  gazillion dollar antenna could be a worthless hunk of junk if you take too long you're on the
*  clock because when it was in the shuttle it was plugged in it was getting its heaters were on
*  and now you got to plug it back in and get the heaters back on in a certain amount of time
*  and so we're like okay we plan this we train this we get up there and the connectors won't go
*  together like it doesn't fit and these two pieces of equipment sat next to each other for like a
*  year in Florida you know like a warehouse and nobody ever thought well oh maybe we should make
*  sure this thing oh no yeah and we get up there like it doesn't fit and we're like crap you know
*  what do we do so uh we're shoving and we're shoving so hard we're pushing on this thing so
*  hard that the guys inside the space station said they feel the space station shaking like that's
*  how hard we're trying and then we see little metal shavings come off and one of those they can get
*  into connectors we're like that's bad so we stopped and uh and then and then this was like kind of my
*  my big hero moment you know like in the movies they like Brad Pitt saves the solar system and
*  stuff you know this is my thing all right it's not that exciting but uh I thought I had this idea I
*  said hey um the problem we were basically having was that the female side was too small and the male
*  side was too big for it to fit together so I said to the uh one of my crewmates inside I said hey
*  how long till the sun comes up because you know it takes 90 minutes to go around the
*  earth and every 45 minutes the sun is either coming up or going down so it can't be that long
*  and he goes actually about 10 minutes because we're behind the earth and it was dark and then in
*  10 minutes the sun was going to come up I'm like perfect so I took the um the the female side um
*  I'm sorry I took the I took the male side and I held it in my glove okay and I put it behind the
*  structure wait I knew the sun was going to be coming from here so I put it in the shadow
*  and I waited for the sun to come up and it hit the female side
*  and the temperature difference if you're in the sun or in the shade is I can be up to like 600
*  degrees Fahrenheit difference so I let the sun hit it and warm it up and I took the male side
*  quickly out of my my insulated hand and away from the shadow and I slid it in and went right in
*  wow and that was it saved the day so you just deduced this just understanding how things change
*  according to temperature yeah thermal expansion wow yeah that's incredible yeah that's my thing
*  did you yell at the people who manufactured it no we were so happy we I have video of this that you
*  can and and we were going woohoo give each other high fives in the suits we were doing like
*  that was uh that was victory that's a great victory though that really is that you figured that out
*  yeah a lot of people have been stuck up there how the fuck did no one try it before they went up
*  there I don't know maybe they did and it just like maybe they weren't when it got up to space
*  and it experiences different temperatures it expanded differently I don't know for sure but
*  so I'm not pointing any fingers but it didn't work and uh but we solved it and that's that's
*  the kind of thing that you can't like until we have AI or something that can really learn
*  you can't code that so that's a real benefit that humans bring to the equation uh being able to do
*  to be able to adapt to something you didn't expect otherwise that thing would have been junk
*  yeah if a robot's doing it you're you're stuck it's going to keep pushing it's not going to
*  you know you're not going to be able to reprogram it now that feeling that you were talking about
*  of looking out the window where it was kind of meh and then the difference between that and
*  the spacewalk is that where you get this real sense of being in space above the earth the
*  spacewalk you can't yeah it's it that's breathtaking because you have this helmet that's like a giant
*  fishbowl and you know after a while you kind of forget that it's there and you're just like
*  it's like you know the old superman with christopher reeve when he's like flying around the earth and
*  he's just like in his underwear or whatever yeah it's like that because you forget like if you ever
*  have gone scuba diving and you get to the point where you just kind of forget you have the mask on
*  I've never scuba dived I've only snorkeled if you spend a lot of time down there you can get to the
*  point where you kind of like forget that you're that you're in this alien environment and it
*  becomes like you become one with it and that's a wonderful thing well you've done underwater
*  exploration as well yeah what have you done there I lived for two weeks in the bottom of the sea oh
*  jesus I get weirded out I get weirded out just talking just you saying that two weeks at the
*  bottom of the ocean yeah how deep uh it was exactly uh 20 000 millimeters under the sea
*  it was about 60 feet which works out to be about oh only 60 feet that's okay yeah that doesn't
*  freak me out too much I thought you were going to say like miles no I'd start panicking no it's
*  about 60 feet but but the cool thing was we stayed there for weeks wow now if you're normal if you're
*  normally scuba diving and you go down 60 feet you have 60 minutes and then you got to come back up
*  or you or you get too much nitrogen in your blood and you're going to get bent right so uh so we
*  but it's not a problem if you just stay the problem is then if you stay you build up all
*  that nitrogen in your blood now you can't go back up so like if you run out of air or you lose sight
*  of your body or something you can't go to the surface because within a couple hours you'll be
*  dead wow so you have to stay down there and we use cave diving techniques that we did a lot of
*  training for to be safe and we have redundant tanks redundant manifolds redundant regulators
*  and we could have valves that we can flip around so we can always make sure we can get air
*  without ever having that in an emergency ever having to come up because coming up is not an
*  option so how do you eventually get out it's a freaky thing it takes about a day and what you do
*  is you take so we're living in this habitat and it was kind of like a submarine on the bottom of
*  the ocean but it didn't have a motor so it just like stuck on the floor like a big like a big
*  cylinder and it had a hole cut in the side here and um and the only thing that was keeping the
*  ocean out was the air pressure inside whoa kind of like taking a cup and flipping it over putting
*  in the bathtub and trapping the air oh god and you just scuba dive on down and then you swim
*  into that thing and then if then once you pop up in that hole it's like you're in a swimming pool
*  inside the habitat and then you just step out into the habitat whoa is have you ever seen the movie
*  the abyss yes it's like that it's like that oh yeah how accurate is that movie i think uh what's
*  the guy what's the navy seal in there he gets like like uh it's crazy from the guys like uh what do
*  they call it the deep dementia or something is that fake yeah that's fake god damn holland wood
*  so this process of getting back to surface level how long you said it takes a day what do you have
*  to do so what you do is you close up that hole and you convert the habitat into a pressure chamber
*  and what you do is you very very slowly bring the pressure back to sea level so you decrease the
*  pressure and you slowly as if you're slowly slowly going up in the water column and then over as you
*  do it gradually the the nitrogen slowly comes out of your blood and you can feel it kind of tingles
*  oh wow over the course of a day you just lie you try to lie still in your bunk and just like read
*  a book or something in there but you feel like this tingling and then after about a day of that
*  they get you all the way back to sea level slowly so that the nitrogen what you know what it is it's
*  like if you take a can of soda and you shake it up if you open it you open the top quickly
*  but if you open the top really slowly and you let it slowly come out you don't get all the bubbles
*  right it's it's that same effect ah that's a that's a great analogy yeah oh what's freakier
*  being at the bottom of the ocean or being up in space up in space is more surreal
*  yeah because the floating the earth out the window the views are better
*  but being down there was pretty wild too i remember once we were doing this experiment where i had my
*  crewmate and i had an ultrasound and we're doing this telemedicine experiment so there are these
*  docs in houston looking at the screen but there's a delay and i'm supposed to find our kidney and
*  i'm like searching around for a kidney and then uh i look up and i look out the window and i see
*  a six-foot hammerhead shark right out the window and we have a guy in the water and i was and i
*  dropped a giant f bomb like you know and uh and all the all the all the docs in houston are freaking
*  out to thinking like in a moment they can see her liver explode on the screen or something
*  and like what's that what has a patient has a patient like patient's fine got a six-foot
*  hammerhead out the window yeah that's got to be really weird right you're you're in that thing
*  in their world for how long two weeks yeah so is that the weirdest animal that you saw is the
*  hammerhead the scariest thing i saw was one night i was taking a dump
*  this is a true story uh i the way you do this okay number one you just pee in the pool okay
*  but if you have to go number two you go into the pool because you it's going to you don't
*  want to float her in your pool right that's of course like caddyshack you don't want that right
*  so what you do is you go you don't take a tank you just take your mask and your fins
*  you go down naked you can uh we had a we had a mixed gender crew so i wore some trunks but you
*  know and then you just go down and you have to swim i don't know it's like maybe 10 15 feet it's
*  not that far and there's a what we call the gazebo which is just a little dome uh that has
*  air inside now you're out in the middle of the atlantic ocean like with no tank no and you're
*  60 feet down it's night you can't see a thing you're alone in the ocean but you can see this
*  little gazebo you swim to that you pop in and then you got air into some valves you let in some fresh
*  air and then you hold on and you just and you take off your trunks and you just let her rip
*  but the problem is the fish get accustomed to this oh jesus yeah so they go there knowing that
*  you're gonna poop as soon as you drop in the water at night it's like the dinner bell going off
*  and there's like school yeah yeah because this is feeding time whoa and so you feel them like
*  yeah pecking at the back door the worst are the angelfish because that shape they can get like
*  right up in there oh boy so you take your fin off and you're like whacking them oh jesus christ
*  so that's all bad enough but like but as you're doing that and you're in the pitch black atlantic
*  ocean 60 feet down no scuba tank at night at night with the sound of the ocean like
*  like lapping against the the dome and you're looking down and there's endless black you know
*  just a black void and you're thinking about every single scary ocean movie like jaws you know the
*  meg uh whatever the abyss all those scary movies right and you think about all this
*  things that could be down there you can't help but go through your head so it's kind of freaky
*  and then you finish and you put your mask back on and i took a big breath and i went down
*  and i opened my eyes in my in my mask in the darkness with my flashlight and i saw like right
*  in front of me this huge eyeball like about the size i don't know of like uh of a saucer
*  you know like this big staring unblinking right at me and i freaked out i just tore off for the
*  for the pool for the moon pool and the habitat i jumped in there i surfaced i'm screaming i'm
*  screaming and my crew come running thinking i like i've been bit by a shark or something
*  and i'm like giant fish and it was it was a goliath grouper oh i've seen those things
*  before they're enormous size of a cow it's like hundreds and hundreds of pounds right yeah
*  yeah oh my god yeah scared to live in hell at me yeah those things could literally eat a person
*  yeah it uh uh it was big enough that's for sure and so it was it just decided it scared the heck
*  they so where were you in the atlantic yeah how far away were you from like florida like where
*  were you at we were just off the coast of key lago okay because that's what i was saying like
*  they live down there yeah that's an enormous fish man huge i've seen videos of people catching them
*  off of boats and it seems surreal look at that yeah there you go yeah there's one it's like a giant
*  large mouth bass that's what it's like if you go bass fishing they're so similar to bass like in
*  the way they look yeah now imagine like jesus christ look at that yeah imagine like being eye
*  to eye with that thing in the middle of the dark atlantic with no scuba tank they're delicious too
*  i bet like i don't know if they taste as good as regular grouper uh i had yeah i wasn't good so you
*  get a different i wasn't gonna find out look at the mouth on that thing good lord i'll tell you
*  another quick story about down there so i went out for a night dive once and i spent the beautiful
*  thing about saturation diving like this is you can do basically infinite time bottom time you're
*  not limited to like 60 minutes you can stay out there for six hours you know whatever
*  so i was not doing this night dive and i found this beautiful shrimp and it was just
*  spectacularly gorgeous it was like translucent you could see through it you see its organs move
*  like internal organs like doing their thing and i stared at it for at least like an hour just held
*  my light on it and just sat there and stared at it and it was really beautiful and i come back
*  inside the habitat and i'm kind of hungry and the best space food we got is shrimp cocktail
*  and i pulled the thing off the shelf and i'm like oh that looks good then i'm like
*  can't do it i can't do it you felt bad because you just saw the shrimp wow i did the next day
*  the next day yeah but that for that day though you really felt bad i felt bad
*  hmm wow grouper you would have felt bad like a nice grouper sandwich it scared me so i think
*  i would have been okay with that after because it was yeah i wonder if they've ever eaten people
*  because it seems like they could i mean they swallow giant fish it seems like if you're
*  not a large person they might be able to just suck you right in there
*  you know see now if this happens to me again i'm gonna be even more freaked out i feel like i've
*  read that grouper have bitten people before yeah like probably trying them out like if they get
*  hungry oh if you're that big you probably have to eat so much yeah it's just non-stop yeah buffet
*  for those guys and yeah so when you're down there and you're doing all the swimming you're using a
*  rebreather no using tanks regular scuba tanks and what is the capacity of these tanks like how long
*  can you stay down just swimming around for we have two and and we can isolate them in case one of them
*  springs a leak but you don't have that much more time than a standard scuba tank but we have is
*  refill stations all around the floor with high pressure hoses so we have these quick disconnects
*  on our on our system that you can plug in and fill it right back up and then you're good to go for
*  you know another couple hours so when you swim to go take a poo you have to do that you have to wear
*  the tank or do you just hold your breath just hold your breath you're not going that far how far you
*  going yeah like 15 feet or so in total pitch black yeah there's a light on the gazebo but that's all
*  so you see that light out there and you know if you get to there that's where you're pulling
*  yeah good lord yeah wow that's got to be so strange yeah what's it like to get back from that i would
*  probably fulfill it it seems like it would be real similar to getting back from space yeah it is it is
*  the thing about it the way it makes it such a great training exercise psychologically is if you
*  had to get to a hospital it takes about the same time from that habitat as it would from the space
*  station in both cases it takes about a day like in the space station you got to get in the Soyuz you
*  got to put your space suit on you got to detach the Soyuz from the space station you got to separate
*  from the space station got to do a deorbit burn you got to land the helicopters got to come get
*  you by the time all that's done it's like a day and the Soyuz is a Russian craft yeah so we have
*  to use Russian crafts to get back from the space station right now we have to use Russian craft to
*  go and come back how weird is that it's not cool what happened all right so uh it's not good none
*  of us are happy about this but what happened was the shuttles uh the shuttle let me just say this
*  is a magnificent flying machine i mean it's really remarkable if you go down to like the California
*  Science Center and you look at Endeavor we designed that thing in the 70s like it doesn't even have a
*  microwave all right it's got conventional uh convection oven wow so it's like ancient technology
*  that the flight computers on that thing your your apple watch could run circles around them i mean
*  it's like nothing they're they're so primitive but uh but it did it took off like a rocket it
*  landed like an airplane you had you could carry people you carry the Hubble Space Telescope in a
*  trunk you can do a spacewalk from it has a robot arm that you see there um yeah there's Endeavor
*  so that's my flight actually that's uh STS-123 in the middle that's the robot that we put together
*  wow but um but anyway the uh it's an incredible machine and we'll never design anything like it
*  maybe ever again uh certainly not anytime soon so despite its technological uh incredibleness
*  for lack of a better word uh it had a couple key limitations one was it's not that safe you know
*  so we lost two of them Challenger and Columbia and uh we could talk about that i knew i knew the guys
*  in Columbia that was really really rough um and then the second thing was it's super expensive
*  because it took so much maintenance even though it was reusable or most of it was it took so much
*  maintenance it took a standing army to keep it running we're spending i think three or four
*  billion dollars a year on the program and and there's no way if we wanted to build something
*  that was going to be more cost effective or safer there's no way we're going to get a plus up from
*  congress with like an additional four billion dollars a year to go do that the only way really
*  to make it happen was to stop flying the shuttle so we took a very painful decision and we said
*  okay we're going to retire these things so we can make something new and we know that there's going
*  to be a gap period where we're not going to have anything and it's going to suck but the good news
*  is is the great timing about this conversation right now is that gap ends this year really yeah
*  2020 is when that painful period is put to rest and what what happens we're going to have a SpaceX
*  Dragon SpaceX Dragon yeah that's a great name yeah i love it yeah we're going to have a brand new ship
*  and not only the dragon we're going to have the Boeing Starliner and and then we have two other
*  private companies that are going to be launching people this year it's incredible these four
*  companies all trying to put humans into space with private companies yeah and the schedules
*  are just aligning so it's all looks like it all will happen in 2020 now they've done some people
*  civilian trips up into space right they have and that's all happened by paying the russians
*  that's what it is for rides yeah why is their equipment so much better it's not um the it's
*  the only game in town once we once we retired the shuttles there was nothing else available i would
*  be like hey um how well are you guys maintaining these things yeah like what are you doing like
*  tell me tell me what's your maintenance schedule it's been a little scary lately because they've
*  had some they've had some mishaps right like what uh well we had a launch ghost squirrely where the
*  rocket didn't work right and they had a they had a punch off uh nick haig was the american on that
*  unfortunately he was fine uh he was off meaning eject yeah oh fuck yeah not something you want
*  to like do for fun so during launch yeah so you're launching and they're like this is not good
*  yeah one of one of the has these side boosters uh-huh and one of them got stuck then it come
*  off right and they were starting to spin out of control and then they punched out oh my god
*  how far how far up are they when they punch up that's okay we say punch out or punch up
*  punch out uh abort you say abort uh okay but um i don't in that case i don't know the exact
*  altitude they were fairly high they were probably i think they were still in the atmosphere so i'm
*  guessing it i'm guessing something like 40 to 70 kilometers up or so and so they punch out and
*  abort and then are you in like a capsule like what are you in in a capsule and then from that point
*  on it's kind of like a normal landing if you survive the the giant uh you know yank i think
*  uh they were pulling something like five or six g's i think when they when they separate or maybe
*  even more that system when they pulled off and then um and then and then at that point you're
*  falling in the capsule and then the parachutes come out and uh and from that point on it's kind
*  of like a normal landing oh the g's got to be crazy right i've did um a flight with the blue
*  angels once oh yeah and i think we went seven and a half g's or something like that wasn't that
*  that bad but it's so weird yeah when you see the consciousness closing in like an elevator door
*  you see the blackness on the sides if the soda straw i'm going yeah it's very weird so that like
*  in space like to get ejected or i guess actually not in space in the atmosphere and do you have to
*  climb into that thing before you can abort or are you in it already there's no time it it's a it's
*  a rocket and in that case it's a rocket on the top that pulls the capsule away from the booster
*  oh wow um just like we did with apollo and gemini now on dragon and also on starliner we've got much
*  more advanced systems that are built into the into the capsule and so they they're they push
*  instead of having a tower up on top that pulls you away they have engines down here that that push
*  and fly away and the nice thing about that is the tower you actually if you don't need it you have
*  to you have to throw it away you have to jettison it but that's kind of like needing to use your
*  ejection seat every single time you go for a flight because if you for some reason if it doesn't
*  jettison you're dead you can't get the parachutes out with that thing stuck up on top so that's like
*  a failure mode that if you put the engines down here you don't have to worry about that plus you
*  carry it with you the whole time so you could use those powerful engines to really get quickly
*  away from the booster like the falcon 9 if it's having a bad day you can use if it's blowing up
*  yeah yeah it's a bad day that's a seriously bad day what does it look like can you pull up the
*  space x what's it dragon what the crew dragon crew dragon whoa there she is that looks like
*  something from the future that's the uh that's the test we just did that's an artist drawing of it
*  but this is the final big test we had to do before we actually put people inside and uh we
*  did that successfully just a couple weeks ago wow so what we did was we um lit up those those eject
*  engines there that's an actual shot yeah that's insane look at that thing yeah it looks like a ufo
*  that's crazy and our rocket went kablooie not that we blew it up but it started uh once it
*  separated the rocket started tumbling out of control and then what made a giant fireball
*  is that normal or expected we we kind of thought that would happen yeah well you were right
*  we weren't planning on using it again there it is so there it is separated from the booster
*  wow and uh the booster went kaboom but the rocket but it was a i think uh if i remember right i
*  think it was a 1.5 kilometers away when uh when the rocket went kaboom and it was fine now when
*  you guys do these test flights do they have to anticipate where this stuff is gonna land
*  like where the i mean you have all this giant metal with fire and you shoot so like as you're
*  launching you have to take any consideration yeah what the trajectory is wow that's the
*  explosion spacex complete successful abort test launch of dragon crew capsule wow yeah so you have
*  to think about where it so they have to calculate what speed how fast the earth is spinning where
*  it's going to drop well that's that's why and theoretically you know you got to be ready for
*  this any given flight now this one we knew it was going to happen but it could happen anytime so
*  you always that's why we always launch out over the ocean oh okay and that's why cape canaveral
*  is where cape canaveral is because if you look at a map of uh florida that's the cape is where
*  florida juts out has a little prominence that juts out to the east into the atlantic and that
*  way you can go due east which is generally what you want to do when you launch or you can even
*  turn a little bit north or south and you're not going to fly over anybody's house or disneyland
*  or anything and if something goes wrong in the old days like on the shuttle we actually had
*  explosives on the tank and there are these dudes these range safety control officers officers that
*  would sit with the big red button oh jesus and if they see you going out of control and you're
*  heading back towards land yeah boom yeah oh my god what a responsibility they have we used to
*  go by before launch and meet those guys look them in the eye and they must look like psychos showing
*  pictures of our family don't get itchy bro don't get itchy they hit that trigger so give it a
*  give it a potato it seems like a crazy way to handle it that the the junk has to fall in the
*  ocean yeah well now the russians and the chinese don't necessarily honor that they actually the
*  chinese have dropped nasty burning boosters on you know it's it's sparsely populated but they
*  still have dropped these things on like villages and stuff oh boy they're a little less really
*  concerned about this kind of thing fucking china god damn it they got but in the u.s. we always so
*  we launch and the reason that you usually want to launch to the east is you want to take advantage
*  of the earth's rotation to give you like a slingshot effect because if you go to the east the
*  earth is rotating this way it kind of slingshots you into orbit oh wow going with the rotation
*  and that's why you also want to be as close to the equator as you can because if you're
*  if you're at the north pole and you launch east it's not going to help you right but the lower
*  you are towards the equator the more of a slingshot you get now did they have to figure out over time
*  where those things were dropping did they ever make some mistakes um i don't think is that we've
*  had rockets blow up on the pad and do a bunch of damage but once they're up and out i don't think
*  we ever in the u.s. anyway had that problem because we always had the ability to blow it up
*  if it's there are red lines and if it passes a red line you push the button now it's all done
*  autonomously so you have gps monitors on board that self-destruct if it sees that it's going
*  past the line there's nobody with the button anymore it's all automatic oh wow and these
*  boosters that fall into the ocean do they have them documented like where they're landing
*  so they know where these things are scattered out throughout the ocean they know approximately
*  and one cool thing was probably the most famous booster that landed in the bottom of the ocean
*  was apollo 11 the saturn five and uh it was just sitting there you know as a fish habitat
*  oh wow and jeff bezos with his own out of his own pocket mounted in an expedition and went and got
*  him got those engines that's when you know you're a baller yeah he just throw some money at pulling
*  the rocket boosters from apollo 11 out of the ocean holy shit it's like yeah that's crazy what
*  am i gonna do this weekend uh maybe i'll watch a movie or now i'm gonna go get those engines look
*  at that wow there you go powerful jeff bezos and the hard part was finding the right ones and they
*  got down there they saw the serial number they're like yeah look at the image finding the right ones
*  because there's a bunch down there yeah there was a bunch of saturn fives wow and they found the
*  right ones look at that that's nuts and perfectly preserved yeah and then when did he do this what
*  yes that's that's the engine that pushed buzz and neil and mike to the wow that's madness yeah what
*  a crazy image boosters landing in china oh yeah oh that's them hitting the ground oh rewind that
*  again but it is very quick i started right where the explosion was there's other ones that should
*  have fallen from the sky ignited on impact with the ground so these people are just chilling and
*  a giant chunk of metals falls from the sky oh my god that's crazy not only that but that's hyper
*  gallic fuel so that's like you don't want to be breathing that stuff that's pretty toxic look at
*  it just landed on people they're like whoops sorry that's a that's a brc big red cloud you don't want
*  to or bf brc you know what yeah you know i mean yeah that what is in that cloud it's hydrazine so
*  it's a nto mmh monomethyl hydrazine and nitrogen texoxide it's um it's stuff you don't want to
*  drink look at that falling from the sky oh my god that's crazy yeah it fell on a small village
*  china doesn't give a fuck they just let it go it is i mean that those villagers are getting
*  pretty unlucky because it is pretty sparsely populated so you're just playing the odds but
*  we wouldn't we wouldn't do that well that has to be terrible for their breathing and their health
*  yeah that stuff is going to linger right yeah i guess we get into drinking water uh-huh i mean
*  the quantities of that are probably not going to be like absolutely catastrophic the bigger risk is
*  getting blown up by it but it's still not good so why doesn't china adhere to the same sort of rule
*  they do what they got to do yeah yeah so when when you're a part of these expeditions and
*  you know you're you recognize that you're one of very few people that ever gets to experience this
*  these kind of things do you feel like a responsibility to try to relay this information
*  to people like yeah it's part of our job you know so when we're when i was that now so they would
*  send us out to do these pr events and we'd go to schools and i would go back to like jersey where
*  i'm from and go visit all these school systems and what part of jersey are you from my my parents
*  are from newark and i i grew up in parsipani mine too yeah i know i heard about that yeah
*  parsipani i know where that is parsipani that's right that's where i grew up went to parsipani
*  high school wow um and so you go back and try to inspire kids to yeah to pursue this same kind of
*  thing and i still do it so i i was just in israel last week um i just got back two nights ago
*  actually so every year on the anniversary of the columbia uh tragedy they have a space week in
*  israel where they have a whole bunch of stem education events and uh there's also a technical
*  conference and then there's a memorial for the first israeli astronaut that was on columbia
*  uh elon so i got to know his family really well and um i go back there every year and and we had
*  the memorial last friday uh and um so yeah i'm still and i try to i think i met every school kid
*  in israel and uh i got to know you know just try to get them excited about the future about a bright
*  future you know well the reason why one of the reasons why i brought this up is i saw a video
*  where you talked about how you during your childhood you had a photo on your wall of looking at the
*  earth from the moon the photograph that was taken yeah and that that's what set the seed or planted
*  the seed in your head yeah right so i i also i also go out and i do a lot of um you know uh
*  public appearances and do motivational speaking kind of stuff and i talk about the importance of
*  both inspiration and determination so i found out uh when i was a kid that they were they were taken
*  uh uh not only fighter pilots but also like engineers and scientists to be astronauts
*  because i was was totally super stoked by the whole concept of going into space
*  but i had a mom that's like uh scared of flying she was typical jewish mom she was like
*  she's like uh i told her once i wanted to join the air force and she in like a public restaurant
*  and she started freaking out and like started like soliciting opinions from the other parents
*  would you let yourself do this and you know that's hilarious so so i never thought i knew
*  that like being a test pilot was not going to happen so i thought being an astronaut wasn't
*  going to happen but then i found out that you could do it you can be an engineer and and be
*  an astronaut and then like that was my eureka moment i was inspired but to be determined i got
*  that photo and i put it over my desk and it was like that was my like that was the beacon you
*  know that was the goal and i kept working and anytime i was having a difficult time i looked
*  up at that thing and said no one day i'm gonna hang that in the astronaut office in the johnson
*  space center and uh i still have that that must have been surreal the moment when you were on
*  that spacewalk thinking about your childhood and thinking about being inspired by those images
*  yeah that would be like holy shit i'm actually an astronaut
*  I mean you really are an astronaut i mean how many are there there's there i think there's been
*  around 500 people that have been to space ever yeah that's nuts pretty small that's not a lot
*  and now with space x what is your role with space x so i left nasa in 2011 and i went down and met
*  with elon and i said hey i really like what you're doing here can i help and can i and he gave me a
*  job so i went i left nasa and i came here and i worked there for seven years did a bunch of
*  different things uh eventually became our director of space operations so my team was responsible for
*  operating mission control at space x and controlling we have another dragon capsule that
*  we use for cargo to take cargo and we've been doing that for a long time up to the space station
*  and back and so we would operate it in mission control but we're also we're designing the the
*  crew one that we showed you so we were coming up with the procedures and all the rules of how we're
*  going to use that thing and and and meeting all of nasa's requirements and helping to provide input
*  to the guys designing the displays and the suits and the controls and the seats and all the stuff
*  you need for people and so that was that was you know i did that for quite a quite a long time
*  what are your thoughts on this what's happening now with space travel where it's transferring
*  into the public sector or the private sector rather instead of being something that the
*  government handles now it's private companies is that a good thing it's a great thing is that uh
*  yeah because first of all it's not quite that black and white um in the media it's all portrayed
*  as commercial space and like these are private companies are taking over the truth is at least
*  for the human orbital space flight that we're doing at space x and that boeing is doing with
*  with their vehicle it's a part it's a public private partnership and so nasa is working very
*  closely with both those companies and we're working together and in a way it's not really
*  that different from the way it's always been you know like nasa didn't have a nasa factory that
*  built the saturn five rocket is built here by like mcdonnell douglas and north american rockwell
*  built uh if i remember right north american built and built the command module and and the lunar
*  lander was built by grumman so those were all private companies they're contractors but they're
*  still private companies and um what's happening now is just a slight change to the relationship
*  between nasa and the private companies where nasa's not micromanaging quite as much as they
*  used to they're saying okay here's our top level requirements we want you to get four people up and
*  down to the space station that's a bit of a simplification because actually the requirements
*  document is like there are thousands of requirements but they but they don't go down and tell you how
*  to meet each requirement they leave it up to you so now spacex has a lot more room to innovate
*  than like north american rockwell did when when they built um the vehicles back during apollo so
*  uh that that and the other thing is different is the the funding the way the nasa's paying
*  it's firm fixed price you know all these are like the space shuttle when we build an aircraft
*  carrier it's it's cost plus contracting which has been terribly abused and and it's been horrible
*  for the u.s taxpayer it what it says to the company is you can it could cost whatever costs
*  that's what we'll pay and in fact we'll give you a profit as a percentage of the cost so like your
*  your incentive as a company is like to make the cost as high as you can so your profit as high
*  as it can be that's ridiculous yeah so it's not cool and and uh but they had to do it that way
*  like during world war ii is when it started because like nobody knew how much it was going
*  to cost to build a p-51 mustang because nobody did one before so they came up with this mechanism
*  but now it's kind of been abused now we're using it to do things that we've done before
*  and then the third thing is that the companies own the intellectual property
*  so what that means is like uh uh rockwell that built the space shuttle couldn't like build a new
*  space shuttle like build like space shuttle enterprise or something and then go sell tickets
*  on it they weren't allowed to but we can so we can we're going to build this dragon we're going
*  to take bob beckon and doug hurley two friends of mine are going to be the first astronauts to ride
*  it to the space station and once we meet our nasa uh nasa is our number one customer they're paying
*  the bill so once they are satisfied we can then go make another one and sell tickets and take you
*  know private individuals so really that's the the key difference and i really think that 2020
*  we're going to look back at 2020 as a year that everything changed really yeah because
*  all those dreams of science fiction like being able to take your vacations around the rings of
*  saturn and like all the like private space stations all that kind of stuff that we grew up
*  hoping would happen when we were older i think it's really finally starting because this is
*  this is the beginning of that infrastructure that that private sector commercial infrastructure and
*  ability to actually get it done we're always talking about how wrong they got the future
*  in like space 1999 remember that television show i like that show i watch it all the time yeah
*  but all those shows like even i think blade runner was like now right didn't we discuss this like
*  last year 2019 like we got everything wrong in terms of what the timeline was the timeline is
*  totally wrong but i think that the overall the overall direction is is right um in a lot of
*  this stuff and we'll we'll get there i really do believe that if if we don't end up killing each
*  other or have some horrible catastrophe like uh asteroid hit us we're going to end up living in
*  space and have that kind of star trek future i mean i really think that's our destiny as long
*  as we don't screw it up man how far out are we looking at star trek star trek might take a while
*  do we got like warp drive and all that kind of years and we got to find those dilithium
*  captain she's breaking up yeah like how far do you think we are like if you had a a wide
*  timeline of like literally being able to go to another planet well you know well going to mars
*  is something we could do now in in a decade if we really really really want to elon keep saying that
*  i think he's right i mean it's it's not a question of technology the big missing piece i think in an
*  understanding about what that would be like is is the effective radiation on the on the human body
*  there's engineering solutions we could come up with for that this is for the prolonged journey
*  the six yeah six month journey once you start talking about so so right now like on the space
*  station i took a bigger radiation hit than i would have if i stayed at home how much of a hit uh you
*  know the amount of dose i took was not that much it's like um uh like a tenth of a severt or
*  something i mean it's like it was pretty what's the severt a severt if you take one severt uh then
*  you're increasing your chance of getting cancer depending on your age and gender about a couple
*  additional percent can you mitigate that with supplements like is there iodine that you take
*  or something along those lines there's some uh you know maybe antioxidants but i think that that's
*  that's not a panacea that's not going to fix this problem it could help maybe they say take iodine
*  tablets right if you're exposed to radiation isn't that like something that they recommend
*  yeah for like for like nuclear reactors or um yeah uh and all that but um i think that protects
*  that protects uh function of some one one of the organs i can't remember but it's not going to
*  solve that's not going to solve this problem but you can shield yourself with anything that has
*  hydrogen in it it's a pretty good shield so water is great like when i was on the space station i
*  put a big uh water jug around my head really i just i figured couldn't hurt and uh uh and then
*  like liquid hydrogen or even plastic that's made this derived from hydrogen uh is is pretty good
*  shielding okay so you could have like conceivably a light plastic suit that you wear that could
*  shield you from a lot of the radiation on the way to mars there's actually a company in israel that
*  is teaming with nasa that's going to fly these like vests on uh to try to shield the people you
*  can also put it in the hull and or you can have just a storm shelter because there's basically
*  once when we're on the space station we're above all the atmosphere but we're still below the
*  magnetic field of the earth so we still get we still enjoy a lot of protection from radiation
*  once you go out of that and you go to the moon or to mars then you're basically hanging it out there
*  you're you're not you're no longer protected by that and so you're going to take either
*  gcr galactic cosmic radiation which is just everywhere out there sounds terrible it sounds
*  bad doesn't it gcr galactic cosmic radiation that sounds really bad yeah yeah those are um uh
*  those are ions up to up to iron so heavy ions that there aren't that many of them but when they hit
*  you they can do a lot of damage uh they have a lot of energy they're they're accelerated to like
*  near relativistic speeds like near the speed of light um and then and then there's a solar then
*  you got to worry about solar flares uh sp solar proton events and those don't come those are very
*  like unpredictable well they're a little bit predictable with sunspot activity but
*  but they come every once in a while and they're giant spikes they last a couple hours to a couple
*  days and they could totally fry you they're even worse than the fuck yeah so conceivably we could
*  send people to mars and halfway there they get cooked yeah so you have a six month window where
*  you have to just roll the dice well so what you can do is you can have a storm shelter right where
*  you put like a lot of this shielding and then if you you could detect the the the spe the gcr is
*  there all the time but the solar events you can you can detect them coming and you have enough
*  warning time to get everybody into the storm shelter how much time do you have um usually when
*  you first start seeing uh some of the uh proton radiation then um uh you start you have like an
*  hour so you got time so you're sitting in that thing going 48 minutes from now it's coming
*  yeah and just like hunkering down there probably grabbing all the water bottles you can
*  and wow and depending upon how big the ejection is you don't know how long it's gonna last yeah
*  it could be at different magnitudes and different directions and it could just kill you even if you
*  have the shield it the shielding i mean if it's a really huge one uh and and we didn't really have
*  any capability of defending from it when we did apollo and there was a between two apollo missions
*  there was one of these big ones oh boy and we just got lucky that it was in between so that seems
*  crazy like what a what a nutty roll of the dice yeah but again there's there's and we keep getting
*  smarter about it and and and and i think you know for like right now we can send you to mars and
*  bring you back and and uh probabilistically speaking you'd probably have like an additional
*  four or five percent chance of developing cancer over your lifetime which is not like a death
*  sentence you know it's a little it's a little uncomfortable yeah yeah but we're getting better
*  and and the thing about it there's two things about it one we keep getting better technologies
*  better shielding we can actually come up with there's there's ways you can do active shielding
*  with magnet you can create your own magnetic field around the ship and uh and and so it'll
*  almost be like star trek with like uh you know a force force field or shields or whatever
*  so we're looking there's ways that maybe we could do that there's also the other thing that we don't
*  know we know exactly what radiation is out there we don't know exactly what that radiation does to
*  humans the best we have to go on is like data from some of the atomic bomb survivors and and
*  radiation workers that work in like power plants and stuff to take some dose but it's a different
*  kind of radiation so right now the error bars are really big so when we say like oh five percent
*  chance of cancer that's taking a very conservative estimate if we can find out what it really does to
*  humans maybe it's a lot more benign and maybe we could sharpen that pencil and say yeah it's
*  acceptable what if people come back smarter what if it's like some fucking x-men type shit yeah maybe
*  you could like you know i mean radiation is always bad in real life but always good in comic books
*  yeah right we wouldn't have spider-man if we weren't for the hulk spider-man there's so many
*  superheroes they were involved in some sort of an accident wasn't dr manhattan wasn't that a thing
*  with him as well i think so yeah i think so i think from the watchman i think he became who he is
*  because of an accident the doctor i believe so yeah and i was hoping that you know i was up i had
*  my kids after i did that flight so i'm hoping that they would like one day genius kids yeah how old
*  your kids now i got a nine-year-old boy and a two-year-old girl notice anything unusual about them
*  i didn't know this one day the two-year-old girl was concentrating on her blocks and one of them
*  started floating but you know man so what what changes have been made since you go from the
*  old shuttle model of that technology to the space x dragon crew thing probably the single biggest
*  change is all the we've gotten a lot better at electronics and software so the vehicle is
*  highly automated and that's why we can fly like like normal people that don't have like years and
*  years of training because it's so much more smarter than the shuttle the shuttle you shouldn't say so
*  much more smarter so much smarter but you're such a genius you're not supposed to use language like
*  that you're goddamn astronaut so much more smarter yeah all right that sounds like something i would
*  say you gotta talk better than that bro yeah i know i'm sorry though sorry to interrupt you that was
*  a math was always my thing the verbal my verbal sats weren't that spectacular but uh you know
*  uh yeah this is much more smarter and what about what about the there was always an issue with the
*  tiles right with the re-entry tiles like and then that's that's what did challenger or no which one
*  was columbia columbia that's what did columbia and the um the new design have they made advances
*  and how that stuff is applied or is it a different surface they use yeah so so that that is something
*  that's also not really aware anymore that the reason that columbia took that damage was it was
*  foam like the big orange tank that's behind the space shuttle it sticks up above the space shuttle
*  and some foam fell off of it and we always had some foam shedding off the thing and in the beginning
*  we took that very very seriously as a major problem but the thing is is this is this concept of um of
*  i'm gonna forget the name of it now um well let me just describe it so so you get away with something
*  for so long that uh you begin it's normalization of deviance that's what it's called so it's when
*  you get away with something for so much so long that something that was a deviant thing or something
*  that was bad is treated as a normal thing and that's what happened to us because we knew that that
*  foam coming off could do damage to the space shuttle and in the beginning we tried really
*  hard to do something about it we treated it very seriously but it was hard we couldn't really come
*  up with an easy fix in the meantime we're flying and nothing bad was happening what was really
*  happening is we were getting lucky and then eventually a big piece came off hit columbia
*  right in the wing uh and it shattered uh made a big hole in the side of the wing but nobody knew
*  for sure and uh they made a bad decision to not like investigate it further assumed it was okay
*  brought him home and and obviously you know what happened so it could be possible to fix something
*  like that if they had known it could have been possible we did a lot of things like when i flew
*  we had a lot of things in place to try to fix that one we got rid of a lot of the foam that
*  was unnecessary we tried to do things that stopped the foam we also had ways of detecting it so that
*  we would know we had uh sensors in the wings we added a maneuver we do when we fly up to the
*  space station we did like a pitch over where we took photographs of the of the heat shield to see
*  if anything got hit so at least we would know and then we could we could shelter in place on the
*  space station so there's a lot of things we could do with the shuttle but the night the thing about
*  with dragon and starliner and the new vehicles is they sit on top so there's no any any foam
*  that comes off the rocket is not going to hit you so problem solved so that that's one example of how
*  we don't have to worry about that anymore now is the surface different do they still have the same
*  tiles the heat shield is not what it looks like again the heat shield is the material on the side
*  of the capsule on the walls of the capsule is is made out of silica so it's it's similar to the
*  the tiles but um the uh the the material that's in the in the heat shield itself is an ablative
*  material it means it kind of like as as it heats up it flakes off and it takes the heat away with it
*  and that's that's kind of more similar to like it was during apollo it's a much more advanced
*  wow look at that thing yeah and that cool can we see that can we go there will they give us a tour
*  i bet we can i bet we might be able to pull that off i want to see a spaceship
*  the guy you should ask was my boss when he was here yeah we were talking about other shit i know
*  i you know i got he's got the keys to the factory but uh but there there she is on the on the
*  launch pad so that white stuff at the top on the capsule itself that's kind of like the same
*  material as the um as the uh as the tiles but the heat shield on the bottom is is called uh pica
*  phenolic impregnated carbon ablator so it's a different it's a different very high tech
*  material that is really really good at withstanding tremendous amounts of heat that that
*  heat shield is way oversized um you could use that thing at least 10 times um and it really
*  was originally designed for actually entries coming back from the moon when you're going much
*  faster and you hit you build up a lot more heat when you hit the atmosphere than just coming back
*  from the space station so ultimately that's the goal for these things to take people to the moon
*  to take people to mars to take people well and reusable right this is just a start so reusability
*  is key and there's elements of this vehicle that are not reusable that trunk you see the thing the
*  cylinder below the capsule is not reusable we throw that away that the second stage on the
*  falcon 9 we throw away and you know elon hates that uh with that the holy grail is 100% reusable
*  but affordable reusability where you don't have to spend like a gazillion dollars refurbishing
*  it in between flights and we're getting there and the next vehicle is going to be the real
*  that's going to be the real hopefully we will we will get that holy grail with this starship that
*  uh that we're working on now so there's a is a top secret one that you can't talk about is
*  that what it is you seem hesitant well it's just you know we got a lot of development going on and
*  and uh it's not top secret i mean uh elon went down to the press conference in front of it in
*  texas not too long ago and showed showed what it looked like yeah this is right here this is one of
*  the tests i think it's called star hopper so this was a beginning uh this is a test bed to test the
*  engine to make sure that we can oh that's fake that's real that's real that is come on that is
*  not cgi really that's the thing that's the thing whoa now the real thing is going to look just like
*  that it's it's it's the this is really testing the engine and the sensors and the electronics
*  look at what is the jet coming out of the bottom those are that's uh that the bottom is a is there
*  as a raptor engine it's burning liquid methane and liquid oxygen and then those puffs at the top are
*  coal gas thrusters just to keep it pointing the right way and so that's landing now yeah my god
*  that's amazing isn't that awesome that is a mate look how gently it lands yeah dude that seems like
*  science fiction i know that's what i'm telling you like this thing and i know that the guys up in blue
*  origin at jeff bezos company's got all kinds of incredible stuff on their drawing board
*  2020 is the start but it's just the start show me that again i need to see that again i need to see
*  the better pictures of it oh okay there it is yeah that i want to see that thing land again
*  that video of it landing is crazy i got lucky did you hold on
*  it's so crazy though does the the image to see it gently come down and perfectly
*  land like look at that man that looks like some war of the worlds type shit like that's in a tom
*  cruz movie right yeah like if they were flying over earth and they were starting to land my god
*  that's amazing i remember when elon first talked about landing rockets on their tails he was like
*  he i think i remember him saying yeah we want to do it just like buck rogers so
*  of course yes so i'm working with uh with with ron moore uh on this tv show i'm working on now
*  wow look at that thing yeah it's pretty awesome huh that's for people want to see this jimmy what
*  is the name of the uh the the video so people listening can go 150 meter star hopper test
*  150 meter star hopper test more than two million eight hundred thousand views
*  700 000 views that's amazing man two million eight hundred ninety eight
*  wow it's on the spacex page so you can go and check that out um so that's next stage that's
*  next stage that's what we're so there's going to be a rocket and then that that thing is going to
*  sit on top of it there's something like that thing and then we're going to get both back the rocket
*  will land on its tail and then after it goes off to the moon or even mars it'll come back and also
*  land on his tail and then we'll get both pieces we'll get 100 back wow and then we really got
*  reusability gone and then and hopefully we'll be able to use these one like 100 times at least
*  now is there any innovation or any breakthroughs in fuel and in the type of propulsion systems
*  that you need i mean do it conceivably is there ever going to be a time where we have like a
*  star wars x fighter that can just go shoot off onto its own you know there's there's a potential
*  for more advanced more efficient thrust engines and and probably one of the most promising ones
*  in the near term is actually a nuclear engine a nuclear thermal rocket where you instead of
*  using combustion uh to propel hot gases out the back of your nozzle you actually use a nuclear
*  reactor and you take hydrogen you flow it over that you heat it up like super hot and shoot it
*  out the back without lighting it on fire and if you do that you can actually get much more thrust
*  with much less mass of fuel like a smaller fuel tank but more thrust over time uh so that's
*  one possible way to go so it's conceivable that one day there could be a standalone unit that
*  doesn't need thrusters that eject oh it still would look like a regular rocket because the back of the
*  nozzle would still have like fire coming out the back but it would just be super heated instead of
*  uh lighting on a fire to heat it up you would you would uh there you go there we go here nuclear
*  propulsion ntp yeah nuclear thermal propulsion so the top one is a traditional and the second
*  one's the nuclear one wow yeah that's so that's yeah so right so there there it is that's the
*  hydrogen coming in and flowing over the reactor instead of having liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen
*  then you just all you need is the liquid hydrogens wow so that's one way but in a short term the the
*  the advance you're seeing there with that star hopper is that um it's still a a traditional
*  chemical propulsion rocket so it's got a fuel and oxidizer which is liquid oxygen
*  because no oxygen up there to have fire you need the pyramid right so you need the oxygen and the
*  fuel and the spark uh and you have to bring your own oxygen if you're in space because you can't
*  use your you don't have the atmosphere anymore so they carry liquid oxygen and some fuel and in the
*  falcon 9 for example it's is basically kerosene it's rocket fuel but it's rp1 but it's basically
*  kerosene mixed with liquid oxygen the engine you saw in that star hopper is advanced and different
*  because what it uses it still uses liquid oxygen but instead of kerosene it uses liquid methane
*  and it's actually not as efficient quite it doesn't have the quite the specific impulse which is a
*  measure of efficiency it doesn't have that quite as good as hydrogen it's better than kerosene but
*  not quite as good as hydrogen but here's the thing you can make it on mars and that's why
*  that's why elon's building that engine because you can go to mars and you don't have to bring
*  your gas to come home oh so that was the big knock on going to mars for the longest time
*  was that you'd never be able to return you have to you have to wait two years for the trajectory
*  for the plans to come back around so you have a window to come home so you do have to stay a while
*  but the the beautiful thing is if you can go someplace and and gas up again fill up your
*  tank without having to bring all the gas with you that's huge right you can you can be so much you
*  can carry so much more that way and and that's you can with the carbon dioxide that's in the
*  martian atmosphere and the water that's in the ice that's on the surface of mars you can have a
*  reaction a process by that allows you to create to take those two things and make liquid methane
*  and you could have the a tank of that ready to go and all done robotically you could get the
*  telemetry back saying we got the gas and then you go now how much are things going to accelerate
*  now that you have all these different companies competing against each other that's what's
*  beautiful is like the pace of of technological change is like really going uh exponential again
*  just kind of like it was during apollo so we're back onto that really rapid that fast track
*  we kind of fell off of that for a little while and um the nice thing about people ask me like
*  what's the biggest difference between working at spacex and working at nasa and i would say
*  it's decision speed because we'll we'll make up our mind quickly now the reason we can do that is
*  we got a tremendous amount of agility because sometimes when you make up your mind quickly
*  you make the wrong decision right yeah but if you hurry up and figure out that you made the
*  wrong decision and you have the agility to then say okay that was not right let's try something
*  else then it works at nasa you know we had all these contractors and suppliers and and a very
*  cumbersome kind of system that we took a long time to make sure we made the right decision
*  because changing things was prohibitively costly but spacex doesn't have to worry about that
*  now what is the difference between the way spacex is handling it you said
*  boeing has something what did they call it again so nasa has this commercial crew program and they
*  selected two commercial companies to partner with spacex and boeing and so boeing is using an
*  older rocket that's been around a long time called the atlas five and they built a capsule to go on
*  top of that called the starliner and so this is strictly for commercial flights well it i mean
*  it's for it's the the the anchor tenant if you will the the core customer is still nasa because
*  nasa is going to use both of these rockets to replace the space shuttle and we won't have to
*  beg the russians for rides anymore let me see what the boeing one looks like
*  what's the name of it again starliner or it used to be called the cst 100 let me see what this
*  sucker looks like we call it the pos 100 because you know we're competing but
*  but it's a good ride it's a good vehicle okay so it's kind of similar in its design a little bit
*  it's the way it looks wow looks pretty dope yeah one key difference is it lands
*  we we splash down in the water and this one lands on land with those airbags oh wow fuck that yeah
*  what if those bags don't work so is it is it fill up like the way they use rovers on mars where
*  it's surrounded by these gigantic airbags and it bounces when it hits the ground it doesn't bounce
*  because that's not good for people robots don't mind but if you bounce like that you're going
*  to be really upset so uh it just hits and and kind of like airbags that deploy in a car they
*  deflate and then you're done and so this is on the same sort of timeline as the space x ship
*  yeah i think they're they're i think space x um space x is really ready to go like in march
*  like very soon but i think we're going to wait a little longer because they're talking about
*  extending the mission for bob and doug and keeping them on the space station so they need more
*  training sorry bob and doug yeah well they get to get to hang out in space for a while i'm not too
*  i don't feel too bad for them and their equipment is keeping them from losing all the bone density
*  and muscle and everything yeah they'll be fine now when does elon go to space no wow i mean how
*  well do you have to have the system working before you put the boss in the capsule and
*  shoot him off into the heavens he's got a lot of work to do here so i don't think he's going
*  anytime soon but um he does eventually when when when we get this up and running he does eventually
*  want to go he talks about he wants to die on mars just not an impact you know that uh that that joke
*  yeah so that's that's you know he's serious about that he really does want to die on mars
*  like he was really old he wants to go and live the rest of his days as part of a permanent martian
*  colony oh elon i gotta talk to you about this but he's not going until he always thought that way
*  yeah that's always been the plan that's always been the plan maybe we can get him high again
*  see if he reconsidered seems like a terrible idea well he's gonna wait he's not gonna be the first
*  one he's gonna wait until we have like pizza there and some cappuccino and like a decent
*  hotel and so the concept is terraforming right that is that's not gonna happen i think even elon
*  would tell you that's not gonna happen in his lifetime that's something that like generations
*  from now we can think about it's that's that's hard so there's some sort of domed civilization
*  like what yeah yeah live in some kind of um pressurized uh compartment some kind of pressurized
*  habitat so it'd be kind of like science fiction like what you see in science fiction things where
*  ships land on planets and people live inside the ships and you can't go outside unless you wear a
*  suit unless you wear a suit yeah wow but hopefully there'll be plenty of plenty of room inside if
*  once this thing grows to be really big uh we also have to make sure it's really really well protected
*  from radiation because even once you're on mars you have to worry about those gcrs and yeah yeah
*  didn't he have an idea to like nuke the caps yeah like nuke the solar polar caps and yeah you know
*  it's not like anybody's really sitting around drawing up plans for that that was kind of like
*  like if we had to do it how could we do it that's one thing you know that came off the top of his
*  head but what was that that was to raise the temperature or to change the atmosphere that's
*  to like melt the caps and then eject a lot of um uh gas into the atmosphere and beef up the
*  martian atmosphere what a weird roll of the dice that would be i don't think we're gonna be trying
*  that ain't that and then what is the the concept like in terms of terraforming what kind of window
*  of time would it take to turn that into a livable environment that you're starting to really uh
*  extrapolate out pretty far and it'd be pretty hard for me to give you a timeline so there's like
*  giant leaps of technology that have to take place that's that's a big one but it's as a proof of
*  concept it's it's sort of i mean there is a theory right that you can alter the atmosphere and
*  i mean mars has got enough gravity that if you could put enough gas into the atmosphere it would
*  stick around um kind of like you know it's it's got uh it's possible you're not going to get to
*  one atmosphere pressure like 14.7 psi like we enjoy here but it might be enough now and there
*  their gravity is what percentage of earth's uh it's about a third third yeah wow so
*  you would you would definitely experience a lot of the same issues that you have if you go to the
*  space station so if you wanted to go from mars back to earth there would definitely be some sort
*  of an adjustment period yeah um the really interesting thing is like we know we have a
*  lot of data we know what happens at in zero g because we have a lot of us have been up to the
*  space station and uh sky lab and mirror and all that and we have tons of data at one g because
*  all of us every day live in one g we don't really have any data in between so the question is is a
*  half a g half as good or maybe it's like 80 is good right and and and so is it linear or is it
*  non-linear we don't know um uh and that's why if we send people and we live on on the moon or we go
*  to mars and we live on mars and we have data like on the moon it's about a sixth of the earth's
*  gravity uh so we'll get points in between and then we can figure out if this thing is there's a lot
*  of stuff that happens to you that may be completely solved but even just the smallest amount of g
*  but we don't know well that's interesting right we don't know yeah because zero g is an issue we
*  don't know how much of an issue one third g is yeah now what about food like what are they going
*  to do with food on mars are they going to have to fly all the ingredients out everything out
*  once you start talking about missions that are that long carrying all your food with you bringing
*  it all becomes mass prohibitive um you know you just gotta take so much and it and that just means
*  you need that that much bigger of a rocket and it just after a while it gets you know to the point
*  where it doesn't work what's all the food for the rest of your life essentially yeah so we're
*  probably if we're talking about like living for a long time on mars or even deep space missions
*  we gotta grow food so we probably plants hydroponically like the matt damon movie yeah
*  yeah how realistic was that you know that movie was really pretty good pretty good movie yeah there
*  was uh i met the author uh the guy that wrote andy weir the guy that wrote the book and i told him uh
*  that i i really didn't uh like his book he told him that yeah and he's like he's like why was it
*  because like there's not really enough dynamic pressure in a martian windstorm to knock the
*  antenna off the roof i'm like nah that's fine with that he's like well it's because we didn't
*  have enough redundancy in the comm system and that's not really realistic i'm like no
*  no because well why didn't you like it i'm like well listen i have a long day of work at spacex
*  i come home i open up the book before i go to bed and i'm reading this like okay i got 62 souls
*  and i gotta cover 3 000 kilometers and i've got 52 moles of nitrogen hydroxide blah blah blah and
*  i'm like it's like i'm still at work i don't want that i want to like i want to some escapism i want
*  to like go home and read a romance novel or something well that's not his fault though no
*  so you're just busting his balls yeah that's um it's interesting though that he got it close
*  yeah yeah he did a great job that's all i mean for something does he have a background in that
*  yeah i think he does engineer or something okay that makes more sense yeah yeah but what that
*  movie was terrifying like the idea that you can get stuck up there yeah the only part of the movie
*  which i don't think was in a book that was not realistic at all was when he cuts his glove and
*  does the iron man thing oh he's like flying back to the spaceship you can't really control it that
*  you'd be you'd spin out of control to try this you'd also need a big hole to really get enough
*  propulsion and then your suit would deflate i mean it's just that's just not going to work
*  yeah and how long would you survive out there with no suit that's a good question um
*  just holding your breath just hold well you can't really hold your breath because as the as the
*  pressure all goes down the first thing you have to worry about is barotrauma so like in your lungs
*  and in your sinuses and it's all going to like like an overinflated balloon so if it's like if
*  you try to hold your breath that's the wrong thing to do because you're gonna so you have to let the
*  breath out yeah you can't really do that for very long though like the way people hold their breath
*  underwater they actually have breath in their lungs yeah right but they're not equalizing with
*  the pressure as they go down you know when they do those like free diving things right so if you're
*  going to equalize you're going to have to let the air out or it's going to just expand and and it'll
*  be extremely painful and and hurt you so you could do that but then eventually you get to the point
*  where the pressure gets so low that the all the liquid in your tissues starts turning into gas
*  and it's called ebullism and then you'll start getting this massive swelling like your neck will
*  puff up like that and everything you'll get grotesque swelling and wherever that your blood
*  is turning to gas and oh all the all the liquids in your tissues are turning into gas it's not a
*  good thing how long will that take before that starts happening that will start happening fairly
*  quickly when you equalize after you breathe out all that air you can counteract it by having
*  squeeze suits like scutes suits with mechanical counter pressure that squeeze it and hold it in
*  like a blood pressure cuff kind of pressure uh kind of thing so you could do that
*  doesn't sound promising no no you know there's there's ways you can you can live through it but
*  it is we've had this happen to people in vacuum chambers accidents like industrial vacuum chambers
*  and one test chamber in nasa once had an accident and we've momentarily subjected people to close
*  to space vacuum but very quickly gotten back to pressure and they were okay so all the bubbles
*  just kind of like yeah i was like slow down now what is the timeline in terms of like does spacex
*  have a multiple stage timeline like a timeline for incorporating the dragon crew and then a timeline
*  for the star hopper and then a timeline for additional projects in the future like as is
*  he thinking along these lines of like of like charted out progress oh yeah yeah he's uh in fact
*  he measures pretty much every major decision by whether or not it brings the day when we have a
*  self-sustainable colony on mars sooner or later that's the prism by which he makes every like
*  every single decision he makes he makes it through that prism jesus yeah so he's got an idea and
*  he'll keep pushing and and uh you know he gives us aggressive timelines that we have to work to
*  and we work really hard to try to try to meet him it's hard when you're doing stuff that this
*  does is complicated to predict exactly how long it's going to take so you know we end up often
*  falling a little bit behind but we do our best that's the case though with everything that's
*  that crazy right yeah i mean no i mean especially elon he's never right in his predictions all's
*  wacky inventions they're always a little off yeah but but but he's so driven you know and he's such
*  a smart guy and um and he's he's he's the most he's really the most driven person i think i've
*  ever met i'll give you a story that to kind of illustrate it once um when i first got hired by
*  spacex we did a interview with 60 minutes and they interviewed elon and myself uh and scott
*  pelle was the anchor he talked to us and he said to me why did you leave nasa and come work
*  for spacex you had like the best gig in the world you know going up on rockets and stuff why would
*  you do that and um i said well if you can go back in time and you're a young engineer and you had
*  the opportunity to like get in underground floor and work with howard hughes when he was like doing
*  all the crazy stuff he was doing in his day wouldn't you want to be a part of that scott
*  pelle he looked at me like with a deer in the headlights look because i don't think he knew
*  what i was talking about but i was like that's but then i realized as soon as i said that like oh my
*  god i just made a terrible strategic error i compared my boss to howard hughes and you know
*  things didn't end up that well for howard you know he went crazy right he went kind of crazy
*  he became washed his hands too much and germaphobe he was peeing in jars and like his fingernails
*  grew out like yeah and i was like oh no i really kind of stepped in it right
*  you don't want to say that about the boss right so um it took a while it was like months later
*  we were driving in a rental car just the two of us in florida we were had a meeting at nasa and
*  we're driving back to the airport to get on his airplane to come back to la and i'm driving the
*  car he's sitting in the passenger seat and i said hey boss uh remember that time we're on tv and i
*  compared you to howard hughes you know i just want you to know i was comparing you to the young
*  dashing starlit dating howard hughes not the old decrepit peeing in jars fingernail guy
*  it's all about the timeline yeah and i was and all i got back was silence
*  and now i'm really scared right and uh i'm sitting there like waiting for him to say something and
*  elan will do this and and i he did this on your show right he kind of like if you if you pose to
*  him a serious question he'll consider it and he'll kind of go into this almost like a trance he'll
*  stare off into space as and you can see the wheels turning he's like focusing all of his intellect
*  which is considerable on this one question and that's what was happening so i waited and then
*  he turned back to me he said you know garret uh i don't think it's an apt comparison i said oh okay
*  uh good good uh why i'm curious why do you think that and he said well none of howard none of
*  howard's designs as brilliant as they were ended up really changing the way we live our lives
*  so we don't send like he made the disbruce goose which is an incredible airplane was all wood you
*  know trying to solve uh the problem during the war of rationing he said we don't send our our
*  goods across the oceans and giant wooden airplanes we don't do that um the h1 racer was a beautiful
*  airplane but it was a one-off it never really led to a large certain designs that changed the way
*  people live their lives so that was his objection was not that like i was comparing him to some
*  creep but that he wants it's really important to him to have the legacy of drastically impacting
*  the way all of us live our lives so kind of the way steve jobs did or or others that that really
*  moved the ball down field for humanity that's what's driving he's such an unusual human i mean
*  there's very very few people that you could make any kind of rational comparison to other than
*  maybe nikola tesla will you really stop and think what he's done yeah and the fact that he does them
*  all simultaneously that he's involved in the boring project he's involved in tesla and spacex all
*  simultaneously and tesla home solar all the the solar panels and the making solar tiles for roofs
*  and he's doing so many different things at the same time it it's it's almost impossible like it
*  i don't understand how he does it yeah i i've seen him do it and i still don't understand it you know
*  it's like i'm i'm kind of burn myself out just trying to do one of those things yeah he does
*  all of them and and um and he does have all the advantages of wealth which helps you know so like
*  he'll have meetings with us and he'll walk out of his last meeting and he'll walk across the street
*  to hawthorne airport hop on his jet and he's at palo alto in a couple hours and he can be first
*  thing in the morning at tesla right and he's got a staff that helps him and you know he's got those
*  advantages um but he he uh that isn't in any way describe what he or or that doesn't explain why
*  he's able to do what he does i don't know how he does it to be honest well he's the next stage of
*  humanity yeah if people are evolving he's he's like looking at us from the next spot he's like hey
*  i've got some ideas yeah i mean he's just an idea factory and and um he his uh uh what's really
*  remarkable to me is is is the breadth of his knowledge i mean i've met a lot of super super
*  smart people but they're usually super super smart on one thing and he's able to have conversations
*  with our top engineers about the software and you know the most arcane aspects of that and then
*  he'll turn to our manufacturing engineers and and have discussions about some really esoteric
*  welding process for some crazy alloy and and he'll just go back and forth and his ability to do that
*  across all the different technologies that go into rockets and cars and everything else he does
*  that's what really impresses me well also the lack of burnout because he's been doing it
*  at this incredible rate 16 hours a day for how long his whole life i think that's nuts i know
*  and he's still hungry for it and he's still taking on these new projects and new ideas and
*  yeah you know at that pace seven seven years was about as like as much as i could take
*  i was like i need to do something else yeah i just don't i you know i mean i'm very happy exists
*  you know yeah but it's very confusing to me i just feel so stupid when i'm around him
*  you know the conversations i've had with them like god damn i'm dumb
*  no i know do what you got to do with what you got
*  i won't go that far so his uh his ultimate goal is to uh create some sort of a colony on mars but
*  he believes that this technology will continue to expand to the point where we will be leaving our
*  solar system we will be making human trips into other solar systems into actual deep space
*  yeah i mean certainly hopefully that's you know at some point if we're going to survive you take
*  the really long view you know the solar system is not going to last forever right it's going to last
*  plenty long and if my kids are listening at home don't worry they're freaking out right now especially
*  a two-year-old oh no daddy said we're gonna die no we got plenty of time couple billion years kids
*  relax it's not in our lifetime they're so funny but uh but eventually uh we're gonna have to find
*  a new home if we're gonna last forever and we all hope that we last forever as a species right so
*  or at least most of us do so uh yeah eventually we got to get there but we got plenty of time in in
*  in the short term the important thing is at least getting out so not in just one place in the solar
*  system because this you know something bad could happen to this planet sure and we've got no backup
*  right in particular if there is a natural situation super volcano super volcano asteroid impact or
*  you know we're doing a pretty good job of trashing this place all on our own yes
*  we don't really need an asteroid to hit us uh we're kind of going down the road of making this place
*  an uninhabitable well what we need is someone like elon who concentrates on the solutions
*  i mean he's always obviously got a full plate many full plates but someone like him to concentrate on
*  solutions to some of the environmental problems that we've created for ourselves here well that's
*  really that's that was the thought behind tesla i mean so so tesla is kind of like plan a save this
*  planet and space x is kind of plan b uh if you look at it that way it's just so weird to have a
*  guy like that amongst us yeah especially uh having him as your boss it was really weird have you
*  talked to him at all about simulation theory we never the thing is when every time i talked to him
*  we focused on and this is what he does you know he focuses on the thing that we are working on
*  so he just that's one of the ways he does his time management that's one of the ways he is able to
*  do all these things it's like he doesn't sit around and and and and bs with you about like
*  what's going on with um was a noralink the company where he's making the chips that go in your head
*  forgot about that that's the other thing he does that one he doesn't in the way humans interface
*  with data he never said to me like garrett what do you think about having a chip in your head
*  they've never he doesn't do that he talks to the people who really know about chips and people and
*  putting chips in people's head he talks to them about it so are you gonna sign up for that no
*  your face
*  the expression you made you're like no my my website got hacked and it freaked me out
*  i don't know
*  well they they're gonna put wires in your head yeah right that's the idea behind it that's the
*  idea christ it's probably gonna be inevitable once it happens i mean i don't want to be an
*  early adopter but once it does happen and it really does remarkably increase your your ability to
*  interface with data because that's the idea right so it ramps up the bandwidth in which people can
*  access ideas and information it's going to change the way we interface yeah i mean i could see it
*  being kind of an extreme have and have not situation like you think about how how far behind
*  you are today how left behind you are if you have no internet access right and then this will be
*  kind of this could be like another level of that yeah i'm worried i'm worried about that
*  yeah i got other things that keep me up at night i got yeah i mean what is it crazy nine-year-old
*  in it real real world problems yeah it's just to me it seems like if you pay attention to
*  the track if you track technology like where it's going things constantly improve they constantly
*  we we demand constant innovation and we're already wearing these things on our body and watches now a
*  lot of people wearing the apple watches and the samsung and all the google watches and it just
*  seems inevitable that it somehow or another advances to a point where there's a chip
*  or something you wear or some plate that they put on the back of your head and screw in
*  yeah but then you watch like black mirror and i know that is the problem this might not be good
*  i mean but do you have a sense of history that you are first of all you're amongst one of the
*  rare human beings that has ever been in space and then two you're working for a company that is at
*  the very tip of the spear of innovation like the that you're at the front of the line in terms of
*  creating viable methods of sending people into space and returning them i feel extremely
*  fortunate you know to have that experience i had at nasa and had the visceral experience the
*  incredible experience of flying in space doing spacewalks operating robot arms launching on
*  rockets and all that and then coming to space x and being there at in the relatively early days
*  and being there for seven years i feel like you know i feel pretty satisfied that i got to see i
*  got incredibly lucky to see these things and be in the room where it happens you know it's
*  it's pretty remarkable and now uh so now i'm a now i'm still a consultant at space x but i'm a
*  a full-time professor at usc so now i'm teaching and i'm also working on tv shows so now i'm like
*  taking that those incredible experiences i had opened up a lot of other doors and like i ended
*  up like for example work and working on this tv show i find myself like in a in a writer's room
*  with a whole bunch of really talented creative people where there's no way in a million years
*  this would ever happen to me if it weren't for these incredible experiences i was lucky enough
*  to have you know it's like that gets even that gets really surreal i could only imagine i mean i
*  can only imagine you mean especially coming from your childhood having that image on your wall and
*  now really being a part of this massive change in the way human beings are going to be able to travel
*  in space yeah now what is tell us about this tv show because you were talking to me about it off
*  here before we started yeah so this this is uh for all mankind it's on apple tv and um the the
*  way i got involved with this thing uh i was a big fan of balsa galactica the the re-do the reboot
*  was awesome wasn't it oh it's so underrated yeah one of the best science fiction shows ever yeah i
*  mean it's like in the early days it kind of like peak tv i guess and it was like um it was just so
*  good i mean the writing was so good and the whole concept and everything all the all the things they're
*  exploring and in uh the science fiction is always at its best when it's like an allegory and the way
*  they explored things that were happening in society like terrorism and stuff uh the way they were able
*  to depict it as in a science in an alternate universe i thought was spectacular yeah it's
*  brilliant brilliant show so i'm watching it on the space station which was like the best place to
*  watch that thing that's crazy do you use an ipad or something like how do you have things stored
*  or is there a tv up there there's no tv but there's we have all these laptops so they can
*  send up files and you can you can give them like four shows that you like how long does it take
*  for a show to download in space well they download it for you which is nice while you're while you're
*  working then when you're when you're ready to watch you just pop up the file so is it like a
*  satellite connection internet satellite uh it's it's kind of it's a it's a k-u band system that
*  goes to satellites that aren't part of it nasa satellites are called teacher satellites so the
*  data goes up to teachers and then down to ground stations to white sands and then so we're gonna
*  bandwidth you're getting what's your latency i don't remember the numbers but um we weren't
*  getting when i was there we weren't getting live internet uh because all that bandwidth is being
*  used for science to get that all the data from the experiments and the video so you can't check
*  your twitter you can now you can now you can now i just missed that that's terrible yeah it's probably
*  like yeah it's probably a distraction yeah yeah just google searching random things are you
*  supposed to be doing your job in space yeah so you you get these shows and you're watching
*  battle star galactica yeah on your laptop watching battle star galactic colbert rapport daily show
*  and like new york yankees games so i'm watching wow that's what i'm watching wow you know i'm
*  watching the yankees games in real time right no pre-recorded wow still though so it was just
*  that was a nice like like a bit at home that you know like i would play the radio broadcast
*  while i was working and just in the background and so it feel like you hear the crack of the bat and
*  it's kind of like you're in space but you still kind of connected to home that seems like something
*  that would go on in a movie yeah like some guy who's working on a spaceship in the movie who's
*  listening to a baseball game oh shit three balls two strikes yeah doesn't that i mean that really
*  does seem very like some classic george cloney movie about space yeah you know it's real yeah
*  wow man dude how weird does it feel so surreal that you were that guy up there with a laptop
*  yeah i mean you and like bowser i'm watching balester and they're like now i'm in the final
*  season and they're like finding earth and i'm like it's right there you're you're in a spaceship how
*  many people have watched battle star galactica while in a spaceship you might be the only person
*  ever well my commander was watching it too so there's at least two of us but so they ask you
*  like are there any celebrities you'd like to chat with while you're up there and they will go out
*  and get them for you the kind of morale boost thing oh wow and so i said i want to talk to
*  ron moore and david ike okay when the creator is a battle star so we had this great skype session
*  wow it was so cool and that's why before i was going to mention this when we're talking about
*  you know science fiction and science fact and how there's this crazy feedback loop about you
*  got to think about it first like you go back and look at 2001 and you see these guys using tablets
*  in 1960 was in 1968 that movie came out and you know steve jobs saw that and said i want to i'm
*  going to make one of those right and so there's this crazy like interplay between fiction and
*  fact and and i got to talk to ron moore about all this and then and then he invited me to
*  come on the set for the for the final episode of battle star wow and you're not supposed to like
*  the first 30 days you're back from a long duration mission you're not supposed to like go anywhere
*  and i'm like uh look they're only going to shoot this once you know it's it's two weeks from now
*  i'm going and the last time i checked this is a free country i'm uh you're not gonna stop me
*  so i went and i went all the way up to vancouver and i got to go on the set i met all the cast i
*  got to be a focus puller on the camera guy got to do the the the sticks you know oh wow i just had
*  a blast and then they made me an extra i was a colonial marine in the back of a ship that gets
*  blown up i'm sure that show was super complicated to make but i would love if they brought it back
*  yeah i don't think people appreciate it enough because it was on sci-fi which is not the most
*  popular network and it's also a reboot of a classic show so maybe it had like a bit of a
*  stink to it but that was so much better than the first version of it it's a great fucking show
*  it's really intense yeah it's awesome it's really really well made i love everything about it from
*  the plot to the acting it's it's sensational yeah this is my favorite sci-fi show of all time for
*  sure yeah me too it's blasting me for star trek fans yeah but it's really good it's fucking good
*  i mean you couldn't have it without star trek you couldn't have it without the original
*  battle star galactica but at the end of the day it's yeah they all kind of build on each other
*  and that's what and so then ron went off and did outlander after that okay and now he came and one
*  day he calls me up and he says uh i got this new idea can i come by we can get together and maybe i
*  could bounce the idea off of you and i was like yeah so he came to space x and i gave him a tour
*  place and then we sat down at the in the cafe and he said okay so i'm thinking about doing a show
*  about nasa back in like the 70s and be kind of like a period piece would be kind of like we'd
*  have a cast of characters but they're all working on apollo and it would be true to real life but
*  it would be the drama of the people behind the scenes i saw that sounds pretty cool he goes yeah
*  i'm also toying around with a slight twist that where we use an alternate reality and in this
*  alternate reality uh things we start at that point but things turn out differently and we
*  start talking about like how close the russians were to actually beating us to the moon which not
*  a lot of people know about but when i was over there in moscow i got to see actually there
*  in they have a warehouse where they still have their lunar lander for example that they built
*  they were really working hard on it so we started what if thing like well what if the russians got
*  there first what would what would america done how think how would things be different today
*  if that seminal moment of neil and buzz you know stepping out on the moon was instead alexei
*  nionov a cosmonaut doing it right and i was like that is freaking genius i mean that was like a i
*  thought i i want to see that show that's like a great premise and he pitched that to apple and
*  they bought it and then he called me up and said you want to work on the show i'm like yeah that's
*  so what is your role what do you do there i'm a technical consultant one of a couple we have a
*  we have a another group of people a couple of people that help out too but i get involved in
*  like everything so i was in the writers room where we're first coming up with basic ideas and sketching
*  out like multiple seasons and character arcs and all that kind of stuff and then i got then i get
*  all the scripts and i read them all and i give notes on all the scripts and then i come to the
*  set and i i meet with the actors the cast and i give them suggestions about like how to look real
*  when they're in space and then i like work with the vfx guys i work with the stunt team
*  the i get phone calls from like the hair and makeup people like how to what do ladies do with
*  their hair if they have long hair when they do a space walk i'm like you're calling the wrong guy
*  but but i can ask a friend right so so uh so all that's just so much fun for me it's like
*  you know you know how like you can pay a whole lot of money and go to fantasy baseball camp
*  yeah and like you get to like have batting practice with the dodgers or something
*  and they humor you because you paid a lot of money well it's kind of like that i keep waiting
*  for them to say like okay uh the fun is over get out of here go back to your day job you know but
*  i'm like i'm just loving it that's wild so how much correcting do you have to do how much do you get
*  to script and go hey that that doesn't happen that you can't do that that's not it depends and
*  every production is different uh the nice thing about for all mankind is they really really want
*  to get it right i've worked on other projects where they say they want to get it right but then
*  they like completely blow off the laws of physics and and you know i'm okay with that because the
*  martian with the hand cutting thing yeah because at the end of the day uh like i said this to some
*  of my students like nobody goes to see a movie for the orbital mechanics
*  you go for the story the characters sure yeah but it's hard if you're an expert in something
*  to watch a movie where they fudge stuff and it doesn't make sense yeah like for me martial arts
*  movies martial arts movies do dumb shit i'm like come on man you know or if i watch a movie about
*  a pool player and i can tell a guy can't really play pool i get upset so for you when you're
*  watching something like um gravity right that was a big one a lot of people got really like
*  neil degrasse tyson i know he hated he hated that he hated it he went to i liked it and the
*  problem is now that i have this job now i'm getting more persnickety about it you know i'm sure now i'm
*  watching i'm like that's not right but yeah everything the gravity the hair that he used to
*  not care though like when i first saw gravity i i loved it because it was a good story it was it
*  gripped me and but you knew that those space stations were not close to each other oh yeah
*  the inclinations or the orbits are totally different you're going to go from one to the
*  other with a fire extinguisher i knew that was complete bullshit don't get me wrong
*  but that leap where they're treating you like you're a moron they're treating you like there's no
*  way you're going to be able to research this but something like you someone like you rather that's
*  your life so like you know that's nonsense you're sitting there watching some hokey solution yeah
*  for something that would never work yeah so if it gets to the point where like but that's a
*  beautiful thing about like doing this with television is you don't have to actually be right
*  you just have to be believable which the bar is like when i'm teaching my class at usc
*  i gotta be right but when i'm like yeah well maybe this could happen right you know with the tv show
*  it's easier but this tv show you're just saying they really want to try to get it right they
*  really do because it's really important to them and so yeah i've ended up making like wholesale
*  changes to episodes because i'm like the original idea i try very very hard not to interfere with
*  their creative process because they're it's really really good at that and um you know i'm not worthy
*  but i'm like yeah okay i see what you're trying to do you want this guy to be the hero you want
*  this person to feel remorse you want this and and and over the course of time this person has a
*  change of heart i get the story but what if instead of doing it this way what if the events
*  occur like this because this could actually happen right and so i tried to change it and it was one
*  like um like episode nine and a little bit of episode 10 of season one uh we ended up sitting
*  i ended up sitting and working very closely with the writers and changing all the technical content
*  to fit to make the story work in a believable way and that when when we do that and then you see it
*  on the screen it's like so incredibly rewarding it's really fun that must be especially as someone
*  who's a sci-fi fan like you've you've had two dream lives here like three or four really
*  it's incredible that you've gone from that from yeah nasa to space x and now to be able to create
*  television shows that you can actually enjoy yeah wow um one thing i wanted to ask you about space
*  is we always hear stuff about space junk about satellites and just junk that's floating around
*  the atmosphere how much of a concern is that and what could be done about that stuff it's a huge
*  concern it's a very very big problem in in uh in certain orbits around the earth low earth orbit and
*  also at the geostationary orbits they're very uh that's where you could put like communication
*  satellites and they stay over one spot of the earth those are very polluted you know there's
*  a lot of junk and it is very dangerous and it's it's a real problem it's hard to clean up over time
*  eventually even even at higher altitudes there's still a little bit of atmosphere like individual
*  atoms eventually that slows you down those collisions eventually slow you down so eventually
*  it comes back but it could take a long long time come back to earth you mean yeah it'll come back
*  and it'll burn up so the most important thing is don't make any more junk that's like the best
*  thing we can do and we're getting much smarter like at space x we take our second stages and
*  all of our nasa missions and after it after we it's accomplished this mission we keep enough
*  gas in the tank to burn the engine one more time and bring it back in one piece so it doesn't blow
*  up into smithereens and cause more junk whenever we do anti-satellite tests though china did one
*  relatively recently and we've done them in the past those are like the worst because they create
*  giant clouds of of junk uh and and we have to still we still have to live with that is there any
*  concepts on the table for how to take that stuff out there's some ideas of um you know using lasers
*  lays the things and and and and and make subtle changes to their trajectories and orbits um but
*  it's all the all the technical solutions are challenging and expensive um so i don't know of
*  any one idea that's going to like just solve this problem easily because we've seen the map of the
*  earth and all the different satellites that orbit it now and all the different pieces of junk that
*  have been identified it's crazy yeah the amount of stuff and it seems like nobody kind of thought it
*  through they just sort of did it and left the junk up there and that's what humans do man i mean
*  like we've been dumping stuff in the oceans forever and not really giving much thought to it now we're
*  finding giant gyres of plastic or down you know yeah so yeah we we tend to not really react until
*  it's a really big problem but it's a big problem and and when i did my first spacewalk one of the
*  things we had to do was we had to bring in this handle uh they were going to use on a subsequent
*  spacewalk it was like it was we call it d handle it's just basically a half inch piece of aluminum
*  around like like this that you can attach to something and then carry things
*  so we had this big chunk of aluminum and we brought it inside and my spacewalk partner rick
*  looked at the thing when we came inside and saw a whole shot straight through it it's like about a
*  millimeter uh in diameter it's really small but it went right through this half inch thick solid
*  aluminum and he looked at that and he said man if that hit one of us and he didn't have to finish
*  that statement because if this stuff is moving uh generally speaking about 10 kilometers per second
*  so that's like roughly uh 10 times as fast as a rifle bullet so if something like that hits you
*  it could be a fleck of paint hitting you at that velocity if it hits you in the suit you're in a
*  hundred percent oxygen environment and you're just going to flame up i mean you're going to instantly
*  combust it's going to be really a bad day so he didn't have to like you said you know when he said
*  that he didn't have to finish it and we both looked at it and then i looked at him and said yeah
*  but you're six foot four so statistically much more likely it's going to hit you more object and
*  besides i was kind of behind you most of the way out there but it probably go right through him and
*  right through you too it probably am i that's what's so crazy about is there's so much of that
*  stuff up there i'm always wondering like why doesn't it hit the space station what it does
*  it does it's a couple times i was inside the space station i heard it take a hit
*  whoa but this but um so i heard the ping but fortunately i didn't hear the ping followed by
*  the boom oh they're leaving yeah so that ping is probably something bouncing off something or
*  going through something so the station has shielding it's called whipple shielding and it's basically
*  a piece of of a wall a thin piece of metal that stands off from the hole so the thin piece of
*  metal is never going to stop this thing but when it hits at that hypervelocity it breaks up into
*  lots of little tiny pieces and it's almost like a fluid at that point it's like these like like
*  almost a cloud of dust and then when it hits the hole those individual pieces don't penetrate
*  so it just it just shatters it and that that works what if it hits that window it has it's
*  hit the shuttle window you know we've it has multiple panes and it's really really strong but
*  we came home with big it looks like like when a rocket's kicked up and it takes really yeah we've
*  seen that yeah wow that's a little scary jesus christ a little yeah what about micro meteors
*  and things along those lines well depending on where you are so in in earth orbit there's much
*  more of man-made junk than there are micrometeorites but there are those two when you get out away from
*  earth orbit like if we're going to go back to the moon then there's no more human-made junk but
*  there is those micrometeorites are still out there and they can do the same kind of damage
*  but there's a lot fewer of them the density of those things is a lot less than what you experience
*  so it's if you if you go to mars i'd worry about the radiation first and then the micrometeorites
*  are like down the list it seems so many things to think about yeah and is this all factored
*  into your television show uh well a lot of these things are i can't can't say i can't give any
*  spoilers season one is available right now it is we can talk about that but season two i'm not
*  allowed to give any spoilers or anything but i could tell you that like yeah there's some of
*  these concepts uh end up in there yeah well listen um it's been a real pleasure having you in here
*  man i really appreciate you coming here and talking uh about this stuff and you you've lived three
*  amazing lives you're in the middle of a third one right now and it's uh you've had a pretty
*  cool one too man so uh now this has been a real honor and a real pleasure seriously the honor is
*  mine man thank you very much so one more time for people it's available right now on apple tv
*  for all mankind for all mankind and uh if people want to find you on social media do you have
*  yes so you can go to my website garritt riesman.com thank you and then uh on twitter and instagram i'm
