# Joe Rogan Experience #1491 - Bill Burr
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 12, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GO_rW0Bvy1I)
*  Hello family man. Hello, sir. Good to see you brother. Good to see you, too
*  We're just talking about like you have two kids now. You have a real family and you got to get an SUV
*  Yeah. Oh, yeah
*  We had something but just once you get the two car seats in the back and then you know
*  With all the shit for the kids and then all the shit your wife has all of a sudden
*  It's just like oh, I now understand remember the suburban
*  Yeah
*  Which was a long like blazer and you look at that thing like who the fuck needs all of that unless you're like homeless
*  And that's where you live, but then you're like, oh I get it
*  Okay, if you have three four kids, yes, you definitely need one. You definitely need one
*  They always bring a bunch of shit with them too. They want to bring stuff
*  So I have to have yeah
*  I have to have room for a toy or this or that those Tesla ones you were talking about
*  Those are great the X with the crazy doors. Yeah, the Lambo doors. Yeah, that's a dope. You've ever seen them dance
*  No, Tiffany Haddish had one. She's in the back of the Comedy Store
*  I heard that she said it to dance and she puts music on it and the wings start going up and the car starts
*  Like turning left and right. It's actually pretty badass. Yeah fun. She's one of the most fun people I've ever hung out with
*  So I wish I was I wish I was there for that. She had the co vid
*  She had it. She got it over. She kicked it
*  I'm surprised more comics didn't get it the way we're shaking hands and meeting people after shows
*  I
*  Yeah, I saw my I got to my wife had the kids we had to get tested so I was I
*  Clean yeah, big Jay Okerson got it. He had it and he's clean. It feels weird to be talking about people that have it
*  Yeah, I know a lot of people that caught it. Yeah, I know about nine you like naming names like Joe McCarthy over there
*  They're fine now well, I like people who've had it now because they have the antibodies they think they can like walk on fire
*  It's like dude. This thing is a brand new thing. I don't know if you want to be testing
*  You know, I got a buddy of mine
*  Ended up getting it and then he was just like well they I got tested I got the antibodies
*  So now I think he feels like he's bulletproof. So they don't even know if you can catch it again
*  They don't they really have no idea. Well people are gonna find out. Yeah, we're gonna find out
*  Yeah, cuz I when I was driving over here
*  I actually got into a moderate level of traffic on the highway like I've noticed that's just
*  At some point I mean considering people are just kind of doing what they want to do and a lot of people were
*  After two weeks everyone just sort of depending on where your ego was
*  Like you know, you're fucking tell me this is all fucking something. I'm gonna go outside those people
*  They just kept it going
*  So now I just feel like well you can't have 60% of the population go broke because less than 1% has something. Yeah, so I
*  Don't know. I think we're just gonna
*  Just go back I think we're just gonna go back and if you get it you get it and if you die you die
*  and if you don't you don't and then
*  Eventually, they're gonna get they're gonna get something that'll slow it down or stop it or something like this
*  It slows it down your fucking immune system. They don't tell you a goddamn thing about that
*  They don't tell you how to take care of your immune system. There's no word about that. It's put a mask on wash your hands
*  No one's telling you sleep more drink water take vitamins. There's none of that
*  I know this one guy brought up vitamin D and his big podcast and then you couldn't find it anymore
*  Did you like fucking Oprah when she attacked the meat industry?
*  I just saw a clip all this guy on Rogan night course
*  It didn't even research so I think who the guy was it was like take vitamin D
*  Oh woman, that's how much I pay attention and I go I got a fucking health food store
*  It's all gone and there was some of this bootleg vitamin D was like vitamin D plus. I'm like what what is that?
*  What is that? I know that that that probably gonna make me catch it
*  So I just take vitamin C and I try to get eight hours sleep
*  I've been I've been doing a pretty good job of a pretty antisocial like a lot of comics, so I haven't had a problem
*  So it away from everybody
*  I quarantine in my house like my wife so you guys can sit down and have dinner with us. I'm always over
*  From alone. No one can hurt me
*  Just leftover childhood shit just coming from a family of loners, so I feel weird not doing stand-up was that been like
*  I did not miss it at all and but I think that whenever there's something like painful in my life
*  I think that that's what I do is I just go I don't care. I don't give a fuck
*  It's all I really learned a lot more about myself
*  during this quiet time of not running around and going to airports and kind of sitting with myself and
*  Being like wow, I thought I was way further down the road
*  Working on myself than I was but I have a lot of fucking
*  Childhood issues left over I got a lot like I really started like all these puzzle pieces
*  Just started coming in and I was able to look all the way back
*  Where I was to where where I am now and how I got here and these little fucking things that happened to me
*  You know good things and bad that just sort of just knocked me down this road that I'm on it was just sitting alone with
*  alone time
*  Yeah, well, you know my wife was going through you know the third trimester
*  You know when we know when they just over it and you're like, oh god, there's six weeks to go
*  No, he's like, oh no
*  You know I'd finally you know get my daughter to bed get her to bed everything was good
*  Make sure all the doors were locked and then I was just sort of like why you know all these years are doing stand-up
*  I'm just up at that hour. Right? So I was just sort of you know sitting kind of by myself like I I
*  Don't know. I haven't been watching TV like the news. You just brought up three things
*  He sees going on Seattle with the fucking FCC. Whatever he says. I don't know what I don't even know what it is
*  What is Tifa and Tifa? They call themselves?
*  Anti-fascists and there they wear masks and carry sticks and helmets and shit and they intimidate people
*  Exactly stop fascism. They use fascism
*  I like stop fascism and they blocked off I think six blocks of Seattle and they declared it a police-free zone
*  This is occupied by the people of Seattle and you you can't use money in that police-free zone
*  I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that's not gonna end well
*  That's the only thing that's gonna keep it from ending badly is that Seattle is kind of a fucked-up city
*  They tolerate a lot of homelessness. So Seattle's got a lot of weird laws like there. It's a it's a
*  Forget the way it's described. I think it's a mutual combat state. That's what's described
*  So like if you're in front of a cop say if say if I'm a cop and you and Jamie decide to duke it out
*  You could just say you want to fight motherfucker and you go. Yeah, I want to fight and the cops will let you fight
*  Because it's some Wild West mining shit from like the fucking 1600s settle it like man the books. Yeah, no lawsuits
*  I like it. You can duke it out in the middle of the street
*  It's very dangerous though people getting knocked out on the street is fucking terrifying because they fall and they hit their head and they go
*  unconscious
*  And there's no refs to stop those last nine hammer fists
*  I think the cops are supposed to do that the cops are supposed to act as a referee to this
*  There's videos of guys getting into street fights in Seattle and cops just standing around watching
*  Yeah, it's real weird. In fact, I don't have a problem two people are
*  willing to do it and they're
*  They know the risks, you know
*  If you get hit you're gonna fall and crack your head on the back of the curb there
*  I mean a lot of them are drunk though. They don't know the risks. There was one of them
*  This is this kid. I think his last name is Fodor. I think Carlos Fodor
*  He was an MMA fighter and he would dress up like a superhero
*  What see see if you can find out what do you remember his name?
*  Anyway, he actually knew how to fight and he was dressed like a superhero
*  So he's kind of baiting people to fuck with him and he's walking on the street and these guys fuck with them
*  That's hilarious. They decide to go at it
*  And then you know, he's bouncing around like a real pro fighter and starts slamming leg kicks in on this guy
*  You see this guy's face like oh my god, what the fuck have I signed up for?
*  He's just some drunk asshole and some dude dressed like a superhero I
*  Don't have any sympathy for those people call I think called himself Phoenix Jones
*  If I saw a guy walking around dressed like a superhero
*  I'd be like that guy's out of his fucking mind and I would give him a wide berth
*  Hoping he was on his way to his place of solitude whatever that
*  Maybe he's on his way home to his ice house. He's on his way to the Batcave or
*  If I was younger, yeah, I might have you know if I was standing in a crowd
*  Yeah, I probably would have done some yeah and punk shit like that couple of whiskies in yeah
*  Oh, yeah, get my fucking orange wig slapped off. Yeah, probably
*  So Seattle is on it's run by a warlord some one fucking dude
*  Apparently according to my friend was run who's a seal was running this entire
*  Seven block or six block area Seattle these spray-painted all the windows on this. Yeah, you know, okay talk to me in three days
*  It's been going on a lot longer than that. It'll be fine. You think so. Yes gonna happen
*  Do you think this war loads what is he's gonna have ten blocks and then eleven and then he's gonna take over all of Washington
*  I mean, he's gonna run out of men. They have guns
*  Okay, that's the problem. The problem is they're openly carrying rifles inside this six block
*  I know but they need to eat. Okay, and then no supplies are gonna get in that seven blocks
*  They're just gonna wait them out or they're gonna come in with superior firepower. It's not gonna end well Joe
*  I don't think it's gonna end well. I'm just I don't know how it's gonna end. All right, let's let's
*  Guess the scenario. Okay. All right, how many bodies? What's the over under for people die?
*  How many are there how many of them are there as thousands? I think thousands and you're only going with four. That's a good number
*  That's like a Vegas number. We like fuck. It was picked the perfect way go over I go under this
*  Price is right. I don't have any fucking people are in there
*  But the photos that I saw the place is packed filled with people like like they're just getting out of a chapelle show
*  Look at this. These are the people it took City Hall. Well, they took City Hall. They own City
*  Oh now now most of them are white so I don't see the staying power of this. Wait, what did you say?
*  They open the door for them. Yeah, they gave them City Hall. So this is City Hall. They're walking into right now
*  Well, this is gonna be funny now when they get in and they don't know what to do
*  Let me hear some volume on this Jamie. I want to hear what the fuck they're yelling
*  Somebody Jamie Masada
*  Jamie's got to go. Yeah
*  The laugh actor in Long Beach got looted last night. Oh god, I can't imagine how many puppets they took
*  Is there puppets in the laugh factory in Long Beach?
*  Are there these giant creepy fucking mannequins? I've that place is oh, it's you know, I love that place
*  I love performing there, but some of the Jamie's decor
*  I love my favorite things to do in this business is shit on Jamie Masada. He knows I love him. Buddy
*  Bill Burr. Black Lives Matter buddy. Don't burn down my club. Yes, please buddy
*  This business has always been weird like that. There's always no that's why you're the king dude
*  Because you got outside of it, but you're totally in it and they can't they can't get you they can't get you I I you know
*  I'm piling up some stories here being in the matrix. I won't get into them, but it's the same
*  It's just the same old
*  Corporations only know how to do business one fucking way and well just they push their advantage
*  They push their advantage they have their leverage and they want the biggest slice of the pie
*  That's that's what they I don't have a problem with that
*  It's when they go beyond that and they just straight-up steal are they stealing from you everybody does every time you get in business
*  We'll take corporate guys. This is how it works
*  It's like the check okay
*  We're in business to make money from them and then you get in business with them and then the check goes to the corporate guy
*  And then you get your cut off of his checkbook
*  So right there I am immediately in a situation where there's no way I can steal from him
*  But he can rob me fucking blind right and you can add a bunch of expenses on the things that front-end load
*  Expenses to make it look like they're losing money and yeah, it's Hollywood accounting. Yeah, no, it's stealing
*  It's stealing is what it is. They just call it Hollywood accounting, but it's not Hollywood accounting
*  It's it's corporate accounting. It's scumbag accounting
*  That's just and it's how they do it and they sleep at night, and then they always have oh that's over in the accounting
*  Section of the building not over here where me and my yacht are
*  I'm like artists friendly, you know I majored in fucking liberal arts in college
*  Well, what was really interesting when podcasts started to take off they started to try to get in with the old model and weasel
*  into podcasts and and buy pieces of podcasts and like if you
*  Your deal is gonna is if you think the fucking industry is gonna sit back when they didn't get to wet their beak on that
*  Thing I'm gonna tell every young comic when we get back to this shit is what they're gonna do now is what the music industry
*  Did well they started started signing straight across the board deals
*  They're gonna get some young kid who's got no power in the business and it's just like, you know
*  We'll help you create a podcast
*  You know signed with so and so blah blah and what they're gonna do is they're gonna own the podcast the advertising money is gonna
*  Go to them and they're gonna rob them fucking blind. They're gonna 100% 100%
*  Gonna fucking steal from them rob them fucking blind and then when they get audited and they get caught stealing
*  They're gonna label that kid that young comic difficult to work with
*  Meaning difficult to steal from that's it's already happening. Yeah, I know guys who young guys
*  I won't name any names, but they've come out to me go. Hey
*  I'm signed to this management company. They want to sign me but they want a piece of my podcast
*  No, I want a piece of this and they they want it. There's no reason. There's no reason
*  Yeah, you got to tell people that you got to tell you got to tell people do not don't give up anything
*  Don't give up anything don't ever it's all you they're not gonna do anything for you
*  What they're gonna do is move the ball quicker that first fucking two years and then the rest is all gonna be you if you
*  Just hang in there and struggle a little bit like you've got a grind. You're just gonna hang in there and keep going
*  I mean, I got a lot of offers to buy half of the podcast or to buy P and I
*  Nothing, I wouldn't I won't I won't do it
*  I will I'll never do it
*  But then Spotify came along and they said we'll give you a licensing deal
*  So just put it on our network for three months, but you still own it, right?
*  And that's that's why we did it that way but this this comic that I won't name
*  He was telling me that is this management company. They wanted to sign him
*  They wanted to own a piece of his podcast forever and I'm like that eventually will become
*  Yeah
*  Cuz what they're gonna look at it is they're gonna make it like if you started a podcast while you were which this manager
*  Or why with this agent it'll be like back in the day when you booked a sitcom
*  Exactly
*  And then if you left the agency of the manager throughout the lifetime of that sitcom you owe the commission to them
*  But back then that you needed them to do that
*  You don't need them for the podcast but they're gonna do that
*  So then you're gonna leave this manager and then for the rest of your fucking life
*  You're gonna be paying this never-ending alimony. Yeah, I mean they'll be guys eventually they'll try to take 50 60
*  I own your podcast. Uh-huh. Managers will start agents will start podcast networks because there's nobody
*  Regulating them to not do that anymore
*  I got an offer just five years ago from a company that was a radio company that wanted 50% of the podcast
*  They were gonna give me no money
*  They wanted 50% of the podcast just to be associated with them and like we're gonna pull together all these
*  Advertisers and it's gonna help your revenue now 50%
*  So that and they never delivered with what they say they're gonna and then they come in and they just they just they got the thing
*  Well, the beautiful thing about podcasts is podcasts all get big on word-of-mouth like I've never advertised this podcast
*  I never did anything with it. I never bought billboards or put ads up anywhere
*  It's just from word-of-mouth and the way other podcasts grow is people get on people's podcasts and they say hey you listen to
*  Bill Burr's podcast money morning podcast fucking hilarious and then it just grows
*  I think it's the job of people making money in podcasting to let new podcasters know do not sign those yes ever
*  Not let the Fox into the hen house because they're going to fucking rob you blind
*  And you don't need and I saw this documentary one time on this heavy metal band Anvil, right?
*  It's crazy thing about this band that just was around forever and never quite made it and there was a I think it was I
*  Think it was that one
*  It's one of those ones about an old like metal band from the 80s and this guy said
*  Like the truest shit ever when he was talking about the music business and this goes straight across podcast everything
*  He goes you're better to own something a hundred percent and only sell 20,000 copies than you are to
*  Not own it at all and sell 20 million like you're literally gonna make more if you just sell 20 20 crazy
*  Yeah, no they fuck cuz and then another thing that they don't like I do another thing that they do is then
*  That all the people that they lose on they dump that on you. Yes. Yes, like I remember one time
*  I
*  forget what I
*  Was with this network and I had a CD that was already made I
*  Already made it and I just wanted them to put it out on their label and they and they wanted to own the CD
*  And I was like no, I'm not no, I don't want you to own it. I just need you to like distribute it
*  I need you as a distributor and the guy said to me goes well, you know ownership shouldn't be that big a deal for you
*  It should be about exposure. I said alright
*  Well, let me ask you this if ownership shouldn't be that big a deal to me
*  Why is it such a big deal to you and he started like stammering and then he basically said well, you know
*  We get in business with something he named a couple other comics whose CDs didn't sell and we have to recoup those losses
*  It's like that ain't my fault. That's hilarious. I could have told you not to sign that fucking jerk off
*  What is your it's not my fault. You didn't do the fucking work. So that's the way I
*  Had another one one time I signed reduce it back when I made like CDs and I did one and I had a 60 40 you
*  Get you know, I was getting 60 and they were getting 40 but their 40 was off the gross
*  Mine was off the net and all expenses for the album was on me
*  It's like I thought we were doing this together
*  Every fucking thing the artwork printing it all of that all of those expenses came to me and in the end that's 60 40 60
*  Net 40 gross they made way more money than I did
*  It's just how they knew like, okay. Well, I'm getting six dollars on every ten. Yeah plus the but anything
*  It's just hilarious that they would come up to you and tell you that we did some deals with some other comics
*  Do I get in business one time to make this TV show and the fucking guys?
*  Sends this the bill for the whole fucking thing. I shouldn't be saying that but this is a while ago, right?
*  the guy was gonna bill is 2,500 bucks a month to use this copier machine and
*  Then another I don't know 4,500 bucks to use his editing. Let's say dude. We have both of those things. We don't need those
*  Let's take that money and put it on the screen
*  We're trying to get this thing to go and and the guy like he oh, it's a funny shit
*  Ever he goes like I'm insulted by those questions or something like that, which is my favorite thing ever
*  the the the offense like the what is the way like
*  The I don't know. You're a fucking thief and you actually have the audacity
*  To be like taken aback like like fanning yourself like I can't believe it's just how many fucking shows you charge in?
*  2,500 bucks a month to go, you know fucking
*  Use your copy machine. Yeah, a lot of money. That's rent for a nice apartment
*  No fucking thieves
*  Machine how much does it cost to use that copy machine? Really?
*  First of all, the copy machine probably doesn't even cost 2,500 bucks. Probably renting it
*  Yeah, probably rents it for a couple hundred bucks a fucking month
*  But even to buy a copy probably has nine shows paying 2,500 bucks a month from the go
*  That's it if you have like a really big one one of those commercial grade copy machines, what does it cost 10 grand?
*  I mean how much could it cost? I
*  Mean that I think he's bought a couple of houses off the phone in that copier machine
*  And I just I just love telling these fucking stories because these are the things that you like what's great about podcasting
*  You can say this this is for every person out there. Yes a fucking business and
*  you know, there's that thing where you want to take it to the next level and
*  Then these these guys come in and then they're all just like yeah
*  well
*  Hey
*  we're gonna take a piece of it and they take a big fucking chunk out of it and what they do is their risk is
*  All the way down here. Yours is up here. And then somehow they just I'm telling you like you're better
*  You better to sell 20,000 copies own it 100% than 20 million and not own any of it because you're gonna make more money
*  That's just how the game is played and those fucking guys who steal from people they they sleep very comfortably
*  But it's also just podcast just the stress of dealing with other people's eliminated just the stress of dealing with production people
*  Yeah, I mean the only thing spot Spotify's ever done so far is ask do you know who the first guests will be and
*  Already I'm like, oh
*  Yeah, they're gonna be who they're gonna be, you know, they're gonna be great. I'm gonna try to call that
*  I call that people that's them justifying their desk
*  Like I can't just sit here like Joe knows what he's doing any idea
*  I'd like to start a email chain and we could maybe circle back later and have a conference call and they're just trying to fill up
*  Yeah, yeah, just having to use time. Yeah, but they have Spotify people have been great
*  They literally said we don't want to do anything. We want you to just do what you're doing. Just do what you're doing
*  But even asking me who the guest gonna be I was like, oh no
*  Please let this be the only question
*  Yeah, I'm never available and that's nothing though, that's nothing
*  I mean, they're great
*  But could you imagine if you were doing that with a network like imagine if you were in business with?
*  ABC or something like that and they were helping produce your podcast you'd have to go in for meetings
*  You'd have to go in and sign into the office bill
*  We sign in here you go and sit down and waste your fucking afternoon having some dopey conversation
*  Yeah, you kind of complain a lot when you read these letters Bill
*  Do you have to when people are signing the emails? Maybe you should be we get a really
*  on the blob of
*  What do you think how do you feel about product placement because we've got a got a great deal
*  Look I just wanted I just wanted to tell a few of those for younger people out there because it actually really bothers me
*  That people do that to people. Yes, it really bothers me and I love comics and I love seeing new comics coming up
*  They have talent and I hate seeing them get fucked over. So hopefully
*  People listen and they do it but they have fucking worms man. They're fucking worms
*  There's a lot of worms out there and there's a lot of worms that try to grab comics real that they're talented
*  But real raw and they try to lock you up some enormous lifetime management deal
*  And and when you take off and you have something save your dude, I remember back in the day when everyone went on
*  Companies were like shooting specials before comics started shooting them and the amount of guys that got that
*  Yeah, we only got enough money for to shoot one
*  You know totally you can only shoot it one time, but you're gonna crush it man. You got this hour down
*  We only got enough in the budget and then they'd show up early and they'd be shooting another comic special off their money the deal
*  To double them as management company what they would get or an agency the amount of fucking times that that happened with the same audience
*  Army. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah the best one I ever heard Jim Brewer was filming a special
*  Sold out this theater and the the people that were filming the special told him that the money for the ticket sales was theirs
*  Because it was all about the production
*  Because the money that people are paying for the production. He's like
*  The fuck are you talking about? This is my audience. Like that's my money
*  His management tried to steal the money from ticket sales and say that it went towards production
*  Yeah
*  Went all the way to court with it his managers on the way to court has a fucking panic attack goes to the hospital
*  Like the whole thing is a nightmare. I
*  Think you want yeah, of course you want. Yeah, he wants it. Well, it's
*  Thievery it's thievery like these are tick people are paying to see that I have I have a million of
*  Those fucking stores and that this but this is the thing. This is what kills me about a lot of this
*  This rhetoric that's going on out there which I agree with 90% of it
*  But if you if you agree with a hundred percent of it like you and I are not supposed to be having stories like this
*  We're supposed to be the ones doing it and it's just like you have to mean like as far as the the whole you know
*  Oh, you're a white male heterosexual, you know doors just fly open and people like hey, what are your dream date?
*  like
*  I'm not saying and I'm not obviously not bitching but I'm just saying that like
*  Like people will fuck you
*  It's all about money. They don't they don't give a fuck and they and they all those people that do that shit really
*  Yeah, so there's a long history of Hollywood accounting. There's a long history that I mean
*  There's been so many stories about people who made killer hit movies and never got paid because Hollywood's like look
*  You know, we have this much had to go to advertising and this is the production look how bad Elvis got fucked
*  Oh, yeah, Elvis got fucked so bad and then one of the main ways he got fucked on the road
*  He only did one out of the country date
*  I believe he did Toronto and he never traveled the world because his manager had something going on with his visa and he was
*  Worried if he left he wouldn't be able to come back
*  So that kind of like fuck him Elvis in a ton of fucking money and see in the world or whatever the fuck he might have
*  wanted to do
*  Keep doing these movies Elvis. You know to go on the road. That is hilarious
*  Well, you know the best version of
*  Breaking down how corrupt the music businesses was by Courtney love they said she had a ghostwriter
*  I don't know but she did but it was it's a it's a great article that she wrote
*  Documenting exactly how much you get paid versus how much money gets generated and where it all goes and how they fuck you. Yeah
*  No, it's it's always done it that way. I mean, that's just always the way they've done it. That's the answer young people
*  That's the answer to it is well, I mean that's how that's how it's done. So whatever
*  I don't want to fucking sit here bitching the whole time. I got some cars. Are you done?

*  That's a perfect movie. Oh
*  Mmm
*  When he's fucking eating
*  We did a family movie night basically every day of the pandemic
*  Who was?
*  First couple of first couple of months
*  Basically every night we watched a new movie watch every single Adam Sandler movie watch Groundhog Day again
*  I forgot how good Groundhog Day was
*  These are delicious mmm shout out to Mike Binder. Yeah, they're very good
*  More anyway, anyway, but podcasting is yes. Well, it's a great business
*  I mean I started off because I was kind of depressed because I had to move here from move back here from Colorado
*  I thought I had escaped. I thought I was gone. It's like I'm out fuck LA. I can't take this crowds and everything
*  I want peace and I want the wilderness
*  In the mountains I remember that and then you had to like have a glock when you went out to go get your mail
*  So you can get eaten by a fucking bobcat or something my own line my own line
*  Yeah, yeah, I saw one in the yard like that. So that could be an issue. I
*  Know that's basically a middleweight tiger
*  To welterweight welterweight, yeah, I'm gonna put seven
*  Well to a boxing at least welterweight MMA is 170
*  Yeah, you know
*  It's a weird animal to see in the woods too
*  Cuz you know if that thing runs at you like you literally have no chance they're scared of you though
*  They don't want nothing to do with you for the most part
*  if they if they're really hungry and really old they'll fuck you up, that's why I I
*  Try to tell you know my wife week when I whenever you're outside
*  I'm like mama bear is next to the cub always always I go there's coyotes and they're getting bold because everyone was inside
*  Yeah
*  And they come down every night looking for a little dog or a little fucking cat you hear that shit going down
*  Mm-hmm in the hills every wifey like, you know, once to ice we should just hear
*  Which is basically the dog like what the fuck is that you know, no fucking brutal. Yeah, it's gross
*  It's scary cuz a little little cleanup crew goes around and catches animals slipping in the backyard
*  Yeah, I don't understand people let little dogs out because those fucking coyotes they'll figure out a way in oh, yeah
*  Well, they're very smart. They they you know, they have to survive they figure out a way
*  Yeah, little creepy fucks. Yeah, they are a little creepy fucks. All right, can I every city?
*  Can I promote this movie F is for family to F is for family season 4?
*  It's coming out tomorrow
*  Tomorrow I got two big things coming out and then that's it
*  I'm dried up because everybody interviews it what what's next for you after these two things. That's I had said it's it's the pandemic
*  I'm gonna start going on the road at all
*  You're opening up yeah, I'm gonna see how you guys do
*  Let you guys walk towards the atom bomb that they just I mean I got a little one at home
*  So I think I'm gonna chill until like September unless it's just wide open by chill
*  I mean if things go well, I'm gonna I'm gonna try to do some shows at the troubadour cuz I know that they're hurting
*  And that's one of my favorite venues all these bands that I love have played their so
*  Yeah, so they're kind of they they're in you know, they're in a bad way because of this
*  So I'm gonna try to do a little run of shows down there, you know, are they available?
*  You can do that not available yet, but when they are available
*  I'm gonna try to do like a three night thing down there, you know work for free get the rust off have people pay for tickets
*  Buy a bunch of booze and some troubadour t-shirts and keep that place going man. That's great. Yeah, I'll do that
*  Yeah, well, I'll do that too. Let's do it. I'll do it. Yeah, that sounds like fun
*  Yeah, I went there twice this year I saw Everlast there and I saw Sturgill Simpson
*  Yeah, it's Steve Steve Martin open for Richard Pryor there. Well, I read this great Steve Martin article where he was talking about
*  Opening for him there. So it also has like some comedy history there when I was there
*  I was saying this is a perfect venue for comedy. It's like 500 seats. It's awesome. It's got a balcony
*  It could be a great place for stand-up. Yeah, it's the stores need the store needs help to everybody needs help
*  Improv needs help. Well, I know the stores good once they can open up. I know they're gonna be fine. Mm-hmm. So
*  Cuz I'm gonna be down there all the time anyway. Yeah
*  so as far as I
*  Think between it now in September if they start opening things up, there's a bunch of little theaters that are around
*  That I would just you know pop in and do a night
*  Like I said just work for free have the people pay, you know, whatever for some tickets and buy whatever they're selling there
*  You know knock the rest of yeah, you know, cuz I'm not gonna have people pay full price
*  I mean I haven't taken this amount of time off since I started. Yeah, you know, I'm like my last gig was uh
*  March 10th the Dean Del Rey bond Scott tribute, dude, you should have come down for that man. I couldn't I had another thing
*  It looked like a lot of Dean fucking
*  Murdered the band murdered it was fucking and we had a great comedy crazy voice
*  He does it really sneaks up on you cuz they'll sing in the car
*  But then you see him when he's in with the band and goes microphone and everything
*  When that video that you guys put on Instagram or him singing a whole lot of Rosie I was like, holy fuck
*  He's really good. Well, he did it for like 15 20 years. You could tell yeah. Yeah, I mean he's legit
*  Yeah, yeah, that was a good time
*  And then it was over. Mmm
*  And then it was over. Yeah strange. Yeah, I got some gigs lined up
*  I'm gonna announce them next week
*  But uh, I'm gonna I'm just gonna hit the road do some fucking clubs knock the rust off
*  It looks like the store is not listed as a bar. It's listed as an entertainment a live entertainment venue
*  Cuz they're opening up bars and restaurants and all these different things and the store they kind of they try to label it as a nightclub
*  But Peter sure is like it's on a nightclub. No one's milling around you stay you sit down you go in and sit down
*  It's more like right. So what do they need to be classified as to open up?
*  Well, they need a different distinction for comedy clubs
*  They don't really have one and you know
*  There's a good argument a real good argument that comedy club should be some sort of an essential business
*  Because people need to blow off some steam. It feels good
*  It's really good for you
*  Look if I was a a guy working a regular job and I was used to going to the store every couple months
*  Knock some, you know knock some laughs into me
*  I mean, I'd be fucking chomping at the bit to go see some comedy right now. Oh, I think they're gonna be packed
*  I remember I was in New York, you know
*  during 9-eleven and I was like is anything ever gonna be funny again and it was like a
*  You know like a two-week low and then they were just fucking packed
*  Yeah, yeah was actually became almost like a second like boom or whatever
*  Way back in the day. I'm worried about a second wave of the corona
*  I'm worried about them locking things down. Someone's gonna step in and stop them from doing that next next wave
*  You guys got to be proactive. You got to do something about people's immune systems
*  You got to lock down old people and sick people let regular people do whatever the fuck they want. You can't you can't just
*  Lock people's freedom down for something that killed a small fraction of what you thought it was gonna kill the whole thing is
*  It's just fucking creepy to have guys like Mayor Garcetti be in charge of telling people whether or not they get to work
*  Like that's not what a governor is supposed to be
*  That's not trying but they're trying to look out for your best interests and trying to get
*  400 million people to all pull in the same direction
*  It's fucking you can't get 40 comics to pull in the same direction
*  So like they have like an impossible they did and they didn't there was those people fucking right?
*  The whole fucking time there's been fucking assholes on my street walking around no masks, you know, not
*  Quarantining like the people that come by the houses
*  You see the fucking you know
*  The same people that were going in and out of the house who are not part of their family still going in and out of
*  The house want people to walk down the street with a mask on
*  Let's not start this job, you know, let's not start this. Okay, let's start. I don't want to start this bullshit
*  I'm not gonna sit here with no medical degree
*  Listening to you with no medical degree with an American flag behind you smoking a cigar acting like we know what's up
*  Better than the CDC. All I do is I listen I watch the news once every two weeks
*  I'm like mask or no mess still mask. All right mask. That's all I give a fuck about
*  I don't care
*  But even they say you shouldn't wear a mask unless you're treating a coronavirus patient the World Health Organization
*  Yeah, they didn't say that initial they didn't say it initially
*  No, they didn't they did and then gradually then it grand and then wait, and then everybody wore the fucking masks
*  This is like rollerblading everybody fucking rollerbladed and then there was that one fucking homophobic joke
*  And then everybody acted like they never did it
*  And then a hundred million fucking rollerblades got thrown into the fucking ocean
*  We all wore masks and then all of a sudden people are fucking sitting there
*  But you don't have the body type for to your fucking knuckles would scrape on the ground
*  even with that extra two inches I
*  Just
*  Love how wearing a mask became like this fucking like soft thing that you were doing like being courteous being courteous
*  Why is it for bitches? That was so stupid
*  First of all, oh god, you're so tough with your fucking open nose and throat
*  She Joe and your five o'clock shadow. This is a man right here. Man doesn't wear a mask
*  Why does it always become like that? It's always like the man's first bitch. It's a man do
*  We make fun of things
*  Anything anything that seems like you're not taking chances, right?
*  That's what I don't have a problem with that
*  Unless you were already wearing the mask and then you're acting like you didn't then all of a sudden people watch your thing
*  And then they all pile up. Oh, look at this bitch wearing the mess
*  It's like you were fucking doing it two weeks ago
*  Well, I was scared out of my mind in the beginning in the beginning like when the first when but everybody's shutting down the beginning
*  And people are stockpiling food. I was convinced. I was like Jesus Christ
*  Do you have like nine elk in your basement? You were you were the one person?
*  It was fine. Tom pop is making bread plenty. I knew I knew he was worried about I was worried about people
*  I knew getting really sick and dying and then I was convinced that I had it at one point times
*  I kind of did you feel like I'm breathing heavy?
*  I felt like my breath is something like my breath is coming short. I
*  Did I did like had like psychosomatic?
*  Nose the bacon about it
*  I
*  Had a fucking panic attack sitting on fucking 12 elk
*  You had a fucking panic attack in the sauna, and then you felt bad about yourself
*  And then you attack people with masks. That's how it works
*  That's how the hatred starts and that's right now why seven blocks of Seattle you can't go now
*  I'm gonna go and I'm gonna drop off free food for those folks those fine protest
*  Yo, there's a major American city where seven blocks the people have took over it and I had no idea what you were talking about
*  So just anything that I said, I don't watch it. I envy you at all
*  I envy that that you just do that you just shut everything down me. I every day I check what part of the world's on fire
*  I don't like
*  Hysteria, I don't like making decisions with hysteria and I like I I when I first became a dad
*  The hysteria of other parents I would just I would be looking at them, but I wasn't listening because oh
*  That's all that's what was the tone of everything was saying, you know
*  Get some sleep now
*  And you'd be like and then anytime you say anything positive about your kid, how would you kid seven weeks? Oh, yeah, how is she's great?
*  She's great. Oh wait till seven and a half weeks
*  It's like dude, maybe you suck at it. Yeah, how about that? Yeah, you're sitting there with your fucking legs trembling, right?
*  I'm nervous and shit. Yeah, I don't I don't like
*  You know, I'm already fucked in the head
*  I'm already fucked in the head. I don't need 24-hour news never like who's that guy on Fox News?
*  I always joke with me Tucker. He's got great hair, but horrible points
*  Like if his points were as good as his hair, which guy he looks like a Kennedy
*  I mean, he's just he is the white guy's white guy
*  He was talking about black people going and when they come for you and they will they're gonna know
*  You know, it's just like what are you fucking talking Hannity? I don't know who he is
*  No, it's not Hannity. Hannity was the guy who they they put with that fucking that that like rooster at the end a chick in the end of his life looking guy
*  Like here's your liberal
*  Dude and all my relatives who are conservatives like I mean look at him. I mean, he's so meek
*  It's like this thing is cast like a show. Yeah, who was that guy that he was with Hannity and Combs?
*  Hannity and Combs and the one guy looked like he was on Death's Door and he was the liberal. He was gray
*  Yeah, he was great. The other guy looked like a football hero astronaut with a square jaw
*  Nice fucking head of hair. The other guy with the little glasses. He looked like Mr. Burns, right?
*  Yes, and he had no spine. He had no it wasn't strong arguer
*  I was he was there he was he was the Washington generals. The other guy was the Globetrotters
*  Conservative point
*  And then you put on CNN you got all those fucking nitwits with the situation room and all of that
*  How about Cuomo and his brother?
*  This is why I wish that there was a comedy club because there's a bit that's already come and gone
*  Was what I loved was when?
*  Colin Kaepernick when he was taking a knee right all the liberals were just like well, hey, man
*  It's just like his opinion man
*  You know, this is a time to listen man
*  And then everybody on the right side shut the fuck up and play football you fucking piece of shit
*  Don't disrespect the flag right and then Drew Brees
*  Tweet something conservative and then all of a sudden everybody in the rights like hey, man
*  This is just like his opinion man, and then everybody on the left's like you fucking racist piece of shit
*  I'm gonna fucking cancel you they literally do this
*  Everybody believes in like freedom of speech as long as you're saying what they want to fucking hear is basically and that's why I
*  fucking hate both of those news channels I
*  Yeah, I I I'm it actually very divisive. It makes my blood boil when I walk into a house
*  With people I know and if they're watching CNN or Fox like I can't get past the like when people watch like the Kardashians
*  It's like why would you do that to your brain?
*  It is what it's like I mean
*  It's very toxic. It's very toxic both sides and they they never see any good points
*  But the other side is making every video on the internet
*  starts after the thing
*  happened and
*  It's like you're always like it's like you're getting eight episodes in and you're like what the fuck it's like you don't know
*  What's like if you watch the last scene of Josh you're like why the fuck did he kill that shark?
*  There's enough sharks dying out there
*  You didn't see that this thing was specifically targeting human beings, and he needed to do this right?
*  How does that relate to the news? I'm saying when you watch the news?
*  People don't like they're not filming what leads up to whatever fucking confrontation happens, okay, so you're getting a very skewed
*  You don't know what happens
*  What they're saying happens could be what happened or a bunch of other shit
*  I don't I don't understand how I'm supposed to watch something
*  You know
*  Like this there's obviously obvious shit like that shit
*  Minneapolis was the most obvious shit ever that guy's a murderer and those other three guys sat around and just watched him fucking do it
*  Well guys calling out
*  I can't breathe and all of this shit and calling out for his mother was fucking sickening that guy's a monster had the audacity
*  Have a shock look on his fucking face that guy's terrible right but like what I'm saying is that thing had all of this
*  He kind of got the whole fucking thing when they came up you had the whole thing
*  There's so many other and I'm not just I'm not talking about cop stuff. I'm just talking about anything
*  Mm-hmm taking a little piece of somebody's stand-up routine or a politician says this or voted
*  He voted no on this and what it is is the shit that all it's usually the shit that was attached to it
*  Which is something I don't understand with politics like why can't you just vote on what you're voting on?
*  Like should we have clean water? Yes, we should and then like the shit that's attached to it
*  But we can still fucking dump toxic shit in here
*  And then when the guy goes to or the woman goes to run it's like oh this this person voted against a clean water act
*  This is your tree hugger. I'm Joe blow and I approve of this message
*  Well, here's it
*  Here's a good version of that remember the Covington school case
*  There was the kid had a MAGA hat on and the Native American was beating the drums
*  The kid was smiling looking at him and they took it
*  Pretending that this kid walked up to this Native American beating the drums and was smiling in his face and mocking him
*  What really happened is these kids were on a field trip for high school, they're selling MAGA hats the kids are 16
*  They'd be in jerk-offs. They buy these hats and put on they're just having fun
*  All right, it's very little supervision while they're there
*  These Native Americans are beating their drums and this guy walks up to the kid and gets in the kids face and is beating the drum
*  Now CNN all these people went with his narrative these kids were mocking him the kid just stood there smiling
*  Well, there's Native American got in his face, but the photo
*  Serving that those
*  You know there used to be rules on ownership of media
*  Yeah
*  I think what way back in the day was like a rule of sevens like no one person could own seven okay any combination of
*  Radio TV because you can literally influence public opinion. That's why like I've watched and I do
*  Twelve years ago. I went down the Federal Reserve fucking rabbit hole
*  I became a fucking the guy you didn't want to talk to about the Federal Reserve all of that shades of probably things
*  Federal is the Federal Express Island. Yeah all of that shit and like
*  Watching I just I just feel like in the last
*  I don't know how many years where it's just all of a sudden they stopped being just sort of everything they were I think
*  Reporting was always perverted to some level. Mm-hmm
*  And now it's just it's just you're sort of watching like op-ed pieces
*  So I don't this is somebody who doesn't watch anything and reads like, you know
*  Autobiographies of football players in the 1950s. So I mean this Covington school kid case they sued the kids sued him one
*  They you know, the CNN paid him out to be a monster. They were getting death threats
*  And did they did CNN also issue a retraction? I don't know what they did, but they paid him
*  I don't I don't know what they but that's why I don't I don't like either one of those channels because of that and it
*  Causes I think rational people
*  Like that guy the guy the fat dude on the bicycle suit ripping those pieces of paper are those girls hands? Oh, yeah
*  Jesus that guy that is the result
*  I think of watching one of those channels 24-7 and then going on Facebook and writing in capital letters
*  Could you imagine if you were there watching that guy rip?
*  Pace pieces of paper out of a little girl's hand like that that he didn't even know
*  Yelling and are running up to her where the mother is yelling you stop touching her get your hands off her. I
*  Would that was the mom I thought that was a friend whoever that was it sound like a woman
*  Sound like a woman yelling
*  Because I was doing he was doing everything but growling. Yeah, and then it cuz then it gets to the point of like what is in
*  your head
*  That you're trying to defend like what that's a guy
*  But then everybody vilifies the guy which I would rather sit down and talk to that guy and be like, let me ask you this
*  When you watch that, you know
*  Floyd video like what is it that you see?
*  Because just yelling it's I mean cancel them and making them lose his fucking job
*  You're just gonna make the guy even more angry and he probably has grandkids that he's gonna fill their head before he before he dies
*  I know what's the solution sit down talk to him. I
*  Think that should be part of it like buddy. Let's just sit down for a second
*  You were on a bicycle you wanted to burn some calories. You're obviously into it by the way you're dressed. Okay
*  You're enjoying America's great parks, right
*  You come across these kids, you know, do you like kids?
*  Have you ever attacked a kid before it?
*  They're just putting a piece of paper up with the point of view like what what do you think led up?
*  To that level of a response because I have to be honest like we've all fucking snapped and done shit
*  I would like to think I have and afterwards I'd be like what the fuck is going on?
*  And afterwards I'd be like what the fuck why did I argue that why did I say that?
*  Why did I do that and the only way?
*  to
*  kind of
*  prevent from you being a fucking asshole again is you have to kind of walk back and look at it, right so
*  Going at the guy which I totally understand because it was it was so bad
*  it was almost comical because he was borderline growling at them and
*  It's not really bad. He didn't even get the paper from the girl
*  Grabs the girl the girl clenched her fist down and held on to the paper
*  My favorite part was the sound of his the bottom of his shoes that clip into the pedal
*  He sounded like a little show pony
*  He was trying to growl like a tiger and he sounded like my pretty pony like somebody should have been
*  combing his hair so and I was sitting there going look at this crazy old guy and
*  I
*  Don't know how I think how old I thought he was but then he was like 60
*  I was like this guy's like only eight years older than me so he graduated high school like eight years before me
*  So like this guy is almost part of my generation like what experiences that he have that he
*  looks at this whole thing like
*  You know I mean I'm not a that that that
*  Thing saying all cops are like those guys. It's like no
*  It's like you have to get those guys off of the force. That's what I think so
*  I just don't understand like and there was my understanding what they were putting up there was specific to the
*  Minneapolis case so my thing is as a human being how could you have?
*  issue with somebody
*  Trying to put something up, you know
*  Honoring that guy or something positive about that like that's what I was confused. I don't know what she put up
*  I'm not sure what you put up. It was definitely about the George Floyd protest. You know, maybe that's a great point
*  I couldn't see what was written on the paper, and I just I filled that in when I watched it
*  But I really couldn't get over the side of the shoes though
*  Really fucking funny. I just started walking faster with the bike. It was almost like a great movie trailer for a horror film
*  Yeah, no, but could you my 60 year old fat bike ride imagine that was your daughter
*  So I'm a project your daughter you're sitting there and that guy runs up to your daughter and he's grabbing the paper out of her
*  Hand he's running at her grabbing the paper to your wife while woman screaming at him to not touch her. Don't you touch her?
*  Yeah, I mean imagine yeah, I mean it's only one response as a father
*  Yeah murder. Yeah. Yeah, I don't like murder
*  No, what do you like?
*  Mame I want him to remember that he did it. That's interesting
*  Start with the blown-out ACL and you go from there. Yeah beat him with this stupid shoe
*  Why do people with I actually if I actually had to look up why people wore those shoes clip in I know they do
*  But I'm like, what is the advantage of that? Is there an advantage? Yeah, I think I think it's when when you're coming up this way
*  Oh, you can you can still pull with your legs. So you're getting more of an efficient
*  Motion this guy's really this guy's really into biking biking and not putting paper on trees
*  Don't put their dead relatives in their faces
*  Just a man that would run up to a little girl like that and grab her grab paper out of her hand
*  There he is
*  Click click click. That's before but that's before he grabs her Jamie
*  Yeah, back it up from the beginning cuz now as far as you with your martial art background
*  You got to be impressed with the way he's using his bike there. No, he's sort of like trying to be a little herd
*  Bicyclist in Maryland to caught on what is the same we want it see right there. Mm-hmm. That's where a
*  Bicycle was caught on video early attacking teenagers were posting flyers. Is that a teenager? It's a little girl
*  Is that really a teenager? She might be 13
*  He just runs up to his yelling at me. Look he's towering. Oh, oh my god. Look at her. Good for her
*  Yeah, see that's I think I don't know if that's a woman or her friend but that girl's got balls or
*  ovaries, I like the little skip step to like a corner back when he's running at the guy with the camera and knocks him over
*  The man achieves his goal. Okay, as much as you don't approve what he's doing
*  Achieves his goal. No, she's still got the paper. I know just I'm choking he grabbed her arm
*  Whatever happened to that guy
*  I don't know but they're promoting my movie right there. Look at that King of Staten Island. What are the odds on demand everywhere Friday?
*  you know, I
*  Would be in the news
*  With a big old fucking orange jumpsuit on if that was happening to my daughter. Oh
*  My god be a real problem. If I caught someone doing anything like a fucking badger on that fucking kiss
*  You your biggest problem would be what do I use I
*  Almost think for a half a second like you would be you know, the elbow. What do I do choke him?
*  What do I fucking do that spinning heel kick? I saw you do you I if you ever hit me with that?
*  I have to learn how to talk again
*  Yeah, Joe didn't happen it didn't happen to your daughter. I know you just we just went to a dark fucking place there
*  I go there all the time
*  Problem with I know I do too. I go there all the time. I do think getting talking about at least protests
*  I think something really positive is gonna come out of this because the fact that so many white people
*  Are also pro and getting involved in it and so many cops were vocal saying, you know, they shouldn't do that
*  So I think something good is going to come out of this. I just agree more
*  I really do and I hope so too because it's it it's been wrong for way too long and I also hope that
*  That a bunch of other groups don't use this as a piggyback thing
*  To then do some other shit which will then escalate will make people who want things to stay the same
*  They'll be able to shift focus of like, you know
*  Like how they try to make like the protesters and the rioters like the looters the same people right right where it's just yeah
*  There's only yeah, you did that and then at night you did this. No. Yeah the way that so I don't know
*  Yeah, I know it anyways. I think there's the once the looting died down you're seeing peaceful protests that are very encouraging
*  I think it's great. I really do
*  I mean that downtown LA one was amazing 50,000 fucking people filled the streets and no crime or very little nothing
*  I heard of it was just mostly people
*  Chanting and holding signs. Yeah, they look promising look they got a the thing that just
*  Disturbs me is this idea that they should defund the police
*  You can't get rid of the police
*  what you need to do is spend more money and train them better and high have higher standards and
*  Do it the way you do the military where it's very difficult to get in and you weed people out that are weak
*  Like that guy was a pussy that guy leaning on that guy's neck like that. That guy's a monster
*  There's no way that guy because he knew he was being filmed too and he just had no
*  Yeah, I mean that's like hands in his pockets like he was just fucking you know, waiting for an uber or something like that makes you think
*  Yeah, he's a monster. Yeah, and that guy had been doing that forever
*  You know there's new evidence that they work together and they fought they they argued about the way that cop was treating the customers
*  they work together at security at the same club and that cop was a fucking asshole to people at the club and
*  they argued about it, so they had a personal issue and
*  There's some people that wanted to be elevated to first-degree murder because of that that he did it on purpose
*  Oh, he knew he knew that guy. Oh
*  Man I mean it's just yeah
*  They argued that when they work together apparently one of the guys that worked with them said that George Floyd
*  Was always telling that guy he's a fucking asshole the way he treats customers because he would mace people and shit that kind of stuff
*  Pepperspray folks. He just was the first guy to use violence right away. Yes escalate this
*  He had a history of complaints back to 2006 my friend Joe Schilling the kickbox
*  I'm talking about him again
*  But his fucking page is the most disturbing page right now because all he's done over the last five six days is post videos
*  of police brutality and
*  It's police brutality on
*  Black women white women white old men black old men young guys
*  Oh, it's just police brutality over and over and over and over again. There's a problem of racism in this country for sure
*  There's also a real problem with people that have the kind of power the cops have that are weak people that are that are
*  Sociopaths and that's that's as much of a problem as any of this
*  Yeah, yeah, you tack the racism on to it and you got a horrible situation, but those people are psychopaths
*  They're monsters that guy
*  Like I'm gonna talk to a security guy and he said the best guys are the guys that that
*  They de-escalate it
*  Yeah, he goes you don't because he this guy used to put together crews of guys to I think was like rock concerts and stuff
*  And he said you didn't want to get
*  guys that wanted to fight
*  You didn't want to have those guys because those guys would be a fucking headache and every night there was gonna be something and there
*  Was gonna be lawsuits like what what you what he was saying you ultimately wanted was nothing to happen. Yeah, so
*  I
*  Remember because I was joking with them
*  A long time ago the grill 93 this old Dick Doherty room. I remember that joint
*  So two guys were about ready to go at it in the club and the bouncer gets him outside
*  Okay, and this guy's trying to say his point of view and he put his hand on shoulder
*  He goes he goes he goes no all I was trying to do he barely barely went like that on his shirt
*  He goes, okay. First of all, don't touch me. That's what the bouncer said and just immediately it was here
*  And then it became then it went to here and then those two guys started yelling at each other and then
*  I don't know what the fuck he just twisted the guy up and took him out and I forget who the fuck I was with
*  we were fucking dying laughing and
*  It just became a catchphrase between us. He would come on. Hey bill you working this weekend. Okay, first of all, don't touch me
*  Just you just you immediately just escalate it
*  Where it just becomes a what the fuck and then first of all don't touch me
*  From 90% of guys is immediately gonna put you in your ego where it's like, oh fuck now now
*  He's on top of me and I'm the bitch I gotta I gotta at least get a little get at his eyebrow level
*  I have to come back with something else
*  It was inevitable the second he said that first of all, don't touch me
*  I did like the three slide steps down because I learned that young watching fights
*  You know, you don't want to have a really good seat because it's like a tornado
*  You don't know where it's gonna go and you think you think you're like 20 feet away. I
*  Met me at a Bruins game the old Boston Garden and it was like one of those, you know
*  Just everybody smoke you probably couldn't smoke in the garden at that point
*  I just remember like like smoky bars and shit. So we went in there and everybody was hammered
*  I was hammered drinking like fucking heffernreffer's member the green death, right? Like this is like 6% alcohol. So
*  Some like one of those two rows of fans fighting which is always great because like the people that are a row up are just
*  Throwing down these guys fucking pound. There's always a loafer laying there, right?
*  Mike Milbury picking it up
*  so I
*  Remember the cops ran up there and I ran up to to watch the fight and they started grabbing guys and coming down the stairs
*  And it was the Boston Guard and there was nowhere to go and I just remembered this big cop bounding down the stairs
*  He literally had a handful of this guy's neck. It was like his whole neck and his jugular and this guy was
*  I just remember he was going trying to try to push me down the stairs
*  Push me down the stairs and he came down like and I was trying to get out of the way and I figured I think
*  The guy who he had grabbed like his knee fucking hit me in the back
*  you know, I just I just got caught by the debris of this guy running by and that's when I kind of learned like
*  you know when it so how to watch your fight which you watch your fight and you're looking at your exits because like I
*  Said it's like you don't know where it's gonna fucking go and I had learned that lesson
*  So when I saw that guy say that first of all, don't touch me. I was just like, okay sliding over here
*  Let some other people settle in in front of me I can do I like them when that yeah
*  That's the same as if yeah, you want to be above slightly above looking down at all the altercations
*  Get a better viewpoint there. Anyway, yeah, I suck at it, dude. I stopped fighting in like junior high. That was it
*  I just I knew I mean, I just knew I was like this is not my thing. I can't slip a punch. I'm slow as shit. I
*  Got a big head I got a target
*  This is not gonna go three rounds. It's just not
*  I fought up until like six rounds sixth grade
*  I think I probably had my last one and then all of a sudden kids
*  started to get a hundred twenty hundred thirty hundred forty pounds and they started being blood and
*  Fucking people missing a couple days of school after I beat down. I was just like, you know, okay
*  I think I'll be the funny guy
*  It's weird how things go sideways like that when there's a there's a feeling in the air
*  Whenever chaos breaks out like that and it's a real melee. There's a feeling in the air. It's like you feel it
*  It's like oh, this is nuts. Like this is this is really dangerous. Yeah, there's a
*  Mob mentality feeling that you get that's real weird when things go crazy. I remember it took me having to leave
*  Boston for about seven years
*  I was gone for seven years before I finally walked into a bar and just felt the normal energy
*  I think the city's changed a lot but like that sort of that tail end of the the craziness I walked into a bar and you
*  Could just feel it. It's like somebody's gonna get suckered. Yeah, not now. It's about 90 minutes away
*  You could just feel the level of drunkness
*  The energy well guys would go out looking for fights. Some guys would go out looking for fights
*  Yeah, there's a guy used to train with Mike Blythe. He used to work at the Ratt Scaler. He was a bouncer
*  He would go over he would wrap his hands
*  He'd wrap his hands on his way to work. I
*  Knew a guy I knew a guy tape his wrists and shit
*  I knew a guy was a bouncer and he used to bring a mouthpiece
*  Yeah to to work but he used to carry it all the time
*  And I remember when he would get to when he would get no fight
*  He would fucking it was it was something when he would it was a mouth good bite down
*  It wasn't like what you guys wear
*  But it was totally psyched the other guy out like he would come out and he would just put this thing in the guy
*  Be like this guy brought equipment
*  And I remember
*  One time he got he got suckered
*  He knew it was gonna be a fight and I figured well some dumb reason he sat down on the stairs and the guy was
*  Standing above him and one of his friends jumped down and just punched him and I saw the mouthpiece was like fucking buster Douglas Tyson
*  I saw his mouthpiece fly towards us and then just I
*  Shouldn't tell these stories cuz why I don't know cuz I you know, it's my version of
*  What it was a long long like very name in names
*  It was like 30 years ago and what happened was we were
*  In an off-campus apartment and I can't believe I want to tell the story I'm gonna tell the quick version
*  No two of my buddies left
*  To go upstairs. It was one of those, you know, those old fucking Boston
*  It looked almost like a three-family house, but it wasn't it was one of those big ones that has all apartments in it, right?
*  So they left up the party we were on in the first floor and then they went upstairs and
*  Like 20 minutes they came back one of my buddies shoulders was separated
*  The other guy flat-lipping and he had a flat top to it
*  Maybe this big fucking gash coming right down here blood coming down his face
*  And we were like what the fuck happened what the fuck happened is that we just asked this guy for a drink and the whole party
*  Started beating on us
*  So this whole mob
*  Goes up the stairs to go fight the party, right?
*  And I'm going upstairs like what the fuck am I doing my big fucking head?
*  I'm gonna get knocked out here, but I have to go cuz of my friends. So we fucking go up there and
*  We hear the party
*  So my buddy the mouthpiece guy like the most innocent void ever knocks on the door. He goes. Hey
*  He's like you see a party going on in there, right?
*  The fucking door opens up and it was like a fucking West Wild West movie like a saloon fight
*  Just fucking haymakers. I remember I didn't want to go in I was so scared cuz I was like, oh my god
*  This is gonna be fucking nuts and just the mob just sent me in and it was just like everybody's just throwing
*  I remember this dude jumping over my back
*  face, right and
*  The smoke fucking clears and it all settles, you know
*  It was all like fucking 15 second melee and it all fucking settles and we look at the party and there's like six or seven guys
*  Six or seven girls and there's like a board game that's tipped over and we had gone to the wrong party
*  Swear to God, I know this sounds like a joke the real party where they got hit was upstairs and
*  I don't know
*  I don't remember what happened but they they were actually rich kids and they sued my friends for going in whatever the dumb shit
*  They did. Oh, no, we all went into the wrong party and they were in there
*  Having like a couples thing and they were playing like fucking Monopoly or something and all of a sudden there was a knock on the door
*  Hey, is there a party and then everybody just came fucking running in?
*  I
*  Imagine them
*  That's what I'm saying. No, that's why I didn't want to tell cuz I felt I felt really like yeah
*  I felt bad when I was in high school. The first real brawl that I ever saw was that I was like
*  17 I think I was a senior in high school and there was a rich kid that moved into the neighborhood
*  He wanted to make friends. So he put on this crazy party
*  He just invited everybody so kids from all kinds of different high schools were coming
*  Yeah, Newton North Newton South a bunch of kids from all sorts of other places and
*  I happened to be at the right place at the right time when I saw it pop off people were already robbing this guy
*  I saw people taking stuff out of bedrooms and running down the stairs with it
*  It was real sketchy because there was way too many people for this guy's part
*  But then this girl I still to this day don't remember what she did
*  She either slapped this guy in the face or she threw a drink in his face. I don't remember
*  I think she slapped him but I what I remember is he uncorked a perfect right hand on her
*  He know how to punch like I remember thinking wow, this guy's trained because he he snapped it
*  Joe always the commentator. Listen, I've been doing it for a long time
*  Whatever she did. I'm pretty sure she slapped him but he went like this
*  Blah, I mean it was a perfect right hand hit her right in the face. Her head goes back
*  This guy behind her catches her she's totally unconscious and then
*  Chaos chairs flying bodies piling it up and I'm on the stairs. So I'm watching this through the railings
*  I see the guy punch the girl as I'm coming up the stairs. I see it all play out
*  I'm like, holy fuck and I'm like I got to get out of yes and it was there was pile
*  I didn't I didn't hit anybody and nobody hit me. I fucking it was like a movie like excuse me, crawling out
*  Everything meanwhile, I was fighting at the time
*  I was traveling to tournaments all over the country and fighting so my friends were looking for me
*  They're like, you know go get Joe and there's piles of people brawling and I'm just ducking the piles
*  And then I ran into my friend Jimmy and I'm like, where is everybody and we gathered our friends and got in the car
*  And drove off we were laughing our asses off
*  But it was like when we left the cops were just starting to arrive
*  There was piles of perfect beating the shit out of each other on the lawn
*  Do I never forget my friend who separated his shoulder in that fight we popped it back in and he went back up
*  Threw a punch with the same arm and missed it came out again
*  I remember him flopping on the ground like a fish out of water and afterwards we said to him like dude
*  Why didn't you throw the other hand and he goes cuz I wanted this hand to get its revenge
*  Like he had made his part of his body like a karate movie like
*  Shoulders death
*  And I have to tell you something when people
*  Talk about you know, you're a funny comedian and blah blah the
*  Characters that I grew up with and what I loved about what they did and what they said was they weren't trying to be funny
*  Like he was dead serious
*  Yeah, and then we were driving home hammered and we were three abreast
*  in the fucking the
*  The pickup truck was this guy's dad's truck and he had the flat top
*  So he's got dried blood on his forehead and we're just driving home and nobody's saying anything and the dude in the middle has got
*  These sunglasses on and he's just sitting there like this and then all of a sudden out of nowhere
*  He just fucking goes like that scared the fucking shit out of me
*  And I did I was like dude, what the fuck are you doing? And he goes us. Sorry, he goes cuz I took a little acid
*  He goes I was looking at this bug
*  He goes
*  Because I thought it was on the windshield he goes it turned out it was on the inside of my glasses
*  Now, I don't know if that was true
*  But dude, there's only like I there's no way you could ever reenact how much he flipped it
*  Like how much you would freak out on acid if you thought a bug was over there
*  But then your mind told you that it was on the inside of your fucking glasses
*  And I just remember all three of us just crying laughing driving home
*  At this it's just a whole fucking situation that was like that was like every weekend of my life for like
*  Probably two and a half three years every single fucking weekend and we used to go in
*  To this there was this club in this bar in Chelsea. Oh
*  Boy, yeah. Well, I got to it. I was such a baby face. That was the only place where you can surf, right?
*  It's a rough place. Yeah. Well, yeah, it was it was yeah, and they were like selling
*  fucking
*  Blow out of there
*  So they didn't give a fuck if you look like you were 12 years old like I was when I go up to order my
*  Vodka Collins was like the only
*  I
*  Wasn't of age like 19 or 20 probably 20 and I would go in there and I just remember one time
*  Standing outside that bar and there was this fucking dude who looked like Rob Halford from fucking Judas Priest
*  Just fucking totally gacked out of his fucking mind standing in front of his motorcycle
*  And he was telling this story about riding his bike and his drug thing. He got stuck
*  He just kept saying I go around the apex
*  Going around the apex. I am go around the apex right now fucking hammered and I'm like making fun of the guy in front
*  To my buddy. I'm looking at my buddy and I'm so shit-faced. I don't go around the apex
*  I'm going around the apex and he's hitting me cuz the guy's staring at me. Oh, yeah. No, it was it was a
*  And I didn't understand like cuz I never did coke so I didn't understand what was going on
*  I'm gonna leave it at that. I didn't understand what was going on
*  But all I knew is I just seemed to be the guy that wanted to go home first
*  Leave it at that. That was a fucking dangerous place. Boston was dangerous
*  No, I am this is when I figured out what the fuck was going on was one time
*  I went into the bathroom by myself to take a leak and was one of those things you walk in there was a sink
*  there was a stand-up, you know, and then there was a
*  Stall which just had one toilet and I walked in and there was two fucking legs guys in there
*  I was like what the fuck are those guys doing?
*  My dick's already out and I'm taking a piss and they open like the thing cuz I didn't have a latch opened up and they
*  Had like the they were doing blow and I was taking a piss cuz it was weird
*  It was two guys in there. I kind of glanced over as I'm already pissing
*  I look over and this guy's all fucking hammered little werewolves. What the fuck are you looking at? I was just like
*  Didn't wash my hands after that one. No, there was a lot. There was a lot. I don't know why
*  because a lot of like
*  Like easy targets really got hit and I was beyond an easy time somehow I just never I
*  You know, I never asked you. Yeah, I did I did cuz I would have got really I was not as tough as my friends
*  Well, my friends were fucking lunatics, you know, but you know my great my grade was cool
*  But like the grade above me and greater below me they were like some fucking they were crazy
*  I talked to friends that grew up in other places
*  They didn't have the same amount of fight stories, I think Boston is a particularly fighty place
*  Fighty, you know I'm saying I don't know what yeah
*  There was something going on. But I mean, I think a lot of those East like New York and fuck this thing's going out
*  a lot of those
*  Like I find the people in like
*  New England, Long Island tristate area. It's all sort of the same savages
*  Savage children of immigrants. That's what yeah, but you go out to the Midwest and that's like German
*  A lot of Slavic people Polish people. So I mean that's I don't know what I think they just had more space out there
*  So it wasn't as intense. You weren't so like packed in you're in a cornfield. There's something about Boston though in particular
*  I think even more so than New York
*  Boston was just a lot of fights man
*  My boxing coach got his finger bitten off on a fight
*  he was on PCP got bit his finger off and he had his toe removed and
*  Replaced his finger with a toe. Did I tell you this? No, I remember they that was that was the man back then
*  So he had it curved permanently so that he could still throw right hooks
*  So his his when you would shake his hand, he would always give you one of these
*  He was like, yeah, I know a guy from Boston too. He had this weird looking nose and some guy
*  Bit it off and had it reattached guys lost years, dude. That's why I'm saying why you know
*  Right around sixth grade. I was just like, yeah, this is like becoming blood sport like I
*  Think I'm gonna try to be funny here. But yeah, there was a lot of
*  Those also a lot of you know, the sports
*  scene back in Boston is just
*  Wasn't saying
*  Well wasn't saying yeah
*  Hockey was big in Boston and hockey is the only sport that involves actual fights
*  It's the only sport where fighting is a part of the sport. I'm reading this book right now. I'm reading like I got three sports books
*  I'm reading right now, right?
*  I'd read a few in that lines and then I'm already a couple chapters over here and I'm reading this one called
*  Barton it gave it to me the called the code and it breaks down for anybody ever never understood
*  Why there was fighting which I never quite understood either. I just knew I liked it
*  It's
*  It's and how the players have to police the game. I I'm not far enough into the book, but it's really eye-opening
*  Like what goes on out there these and they have all these these enforcers talking about it
*  Like he goes sometimes you had to fight sometimes guys would just skate out
*  They put him out just the guy being out on the ice. Sometimes he'd say something like hey, we don't settle it down out here
*  Boy, somebody's gonna get hurt a guy would just say that and then people like alright, okay
*  Let's fucking sticks back down everybody play old-time hockey whatever the fuck you're supposed to do all-star hockey and
*  Just as far and then as far as like
*  How there's this whole code of and there's all these there's like, you know
*  the heavyweights like a heavyweight only fucks with a heavyweight unless some middleweight is
*  Doing some shit and you gave him a warning and he didn't it then he has to take a fucking beating and if he doesn't
*  Take the beating and turtles up
*  That means one of his fucking teammates is gonna get the beating and then he's gonna be a fucking asshole in the locker room
*  I mean it is it is this whole web of
*  Fascinating shit because everybody just looks at the sport and they just think drop gloves fucking beat the shit
*  I'm there's a whole
*  Fucking thing that that is going on out there that actually because of that it keeps the game safer, which I don't
*  Understand I don't understand. I don't understand it either, but I just think it's fascinating that there's this one sport where it's okay to fight
*  Like you know, what are you talking about? What you do? That's all they do is fight. That's the whole sport
*  That's the sport itself, but there's no fighting in basketball
*  There's a greed upon fighting in hockey that doesn't exist in any other sport where everybody backs off and these guys go on the cross
*  You can do it in lacrosse. Who the fuck please professional lacrosse. I
*  Don't know but I wouldn't want to say I wouldn't want to say that to one of them this full fucking cage
*  I wouldn't say that but those guys are savages for no
*  What about the cross-country skiers and all of a sudden they got a rifle they're doing like they're in a gun range
*  I mean that's different. That's that stupid fucking what is that? That's not the decathlon
*  You know what that's like that's like Tex Tex mecs food, right Asian infused
*  Americana that's all it is. It's just people
*  People are you know doing their version of cross-country skiing like that's like
*  Yeah, I
*  Like that cross-country skiing whether you then shoot that's like the beginning of a lot of James Bond things
*  We seem to be in the snow. Yeah. Well the whole idea is the elevated heart rate. It's hard to control your shot
*  Because I think they're supposed to shoot offhand it too, you know, they're not supposed to have a rest
*  I know see I don't know shit about hunting and that's the thing that I always that I lived for on the hunting shows
*  What was when the guys after the kill and then they just be oh man, I was so scared
*  I didn't just saying all this fucking shit and it's I get it if you're shooting like a lion
*  It's a nerve-racking thing because you don't want to fuck up and you know
*  It's like people are gonna make fun of you. No because you're gonna hurt an animal
*  You don't want to wound the animal you want to kill it. You want to kill it cleanly
*  It's and you have to keep it together while you're you're pulling the trigger on an animal. You're gonna end its life
*  It's very nerve-racking. Okay, did you just give him the second one?
*  Second bullet. Oh, I was saying if he runs away and then I think suffers if you nick it, you know
*  You shoot it in the leg or something like that. It's very likely
*  It's gonna get away and die slowly and get eaten by coyotes or something. It's really bad, dude
*  I got one for you because you got me watching those fucking videos
*  Animals eat another first of all, I love bears, but I can't watch them kill anything cuz they don't the recent one
*  They don't bear down the Buffalo. They don't kill it. Why won't they kill it killed it?
*  Well, they just they kill it cuz they start eating it before it's dead. Yeah, they just hold it down and start eating
*  Yeah, that's what bears do. I got one for you. Okay. Have you watched the praying mantises videos? Yes
*  I have you see the one with a praying mantis eats the lizard. It tries to eat him
*  Well, he cuz he fucking alligator armed it he was like I'm gonna kill you
*  He kind of did the little flicky he gave him a little jab and then that thing just grabbed him
*  He was like, ah, what the fuck and then starts licked at him then started
*  Yeah, but if he is jaw, but if he let his hands go as you guys say with his tongue, I
*  Think he could have pulled that thing in and crushed him. No, no praying mantis is so fucking strong
*  There's so much stronger than you would imagine them being because they have these little stick arms
*  Yeah, that I watched one eat a hummingbird. Oh, yeah. Yeah, they eat all kinds of shit
*  They'd everything that they get a hold of we're lucky. They're little
*  Praying mantises are amazing. I fucking love those little things
*  They're they're crazy what they can do to a bird or something much larger than the lizard was the most impressive
*  Because the lizard thought it was gonna eat him and that thing was totally immobilized. Yeah, it was like
*  Reminded me of watching the shit that you say well, he's past his guard. Yeah now he's going for this that thing was just like
*  Oh, it's exactly like that because the their clamp is so it's like if somebody got you in a dars
*  It's the same thing if someone gets like a like this grip and then cinches it up to a dars choke
*  You're like trapped in there. That's what it was like. He was there. It is. This is poor fuck
*  Look, he thinks he's gonna get him and he's like bitch you ain't get nothing but look how he holds his mouth open
*  He's like, oh dude, I hate I feel so but this lizard get he gets away he gets away for a second
*  But this is what's crazy second. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Look at
*  He starts eating his mouth. He just starts slowly. I know what he's doing. I know what he's doing. I love it
*  Have you ever seen praying mantis versus a murder hornet? You know, everybody's afraid of murder hornets. Look at him
*  He's like fuck. What did you do to my face? Oh Jesus. He's like in pain
*  He's shaking it off and the praying mantis is like bitch. I'm not done with you yet
*  Like he's an agony and he's spazzing around and the praying mantis just locks onto him again and slowly starts pulling him apart
*  And at the end he's dead. He just starts eating his brain. Look at that
*  They just can pull that skin apart and bite right through it, but it thinks so much bigger than him
*  That's like you eating a cow. That's like you holding a cow down
*  I wouldn't do that to look at it. He's eating his fucking brain
*  Lizards dead as fuck. Well that that part's not a problem for me right here cuz now it's dead
*  Yeah, but it died this way. I know it did that was the part I love it
*  I'm a big fan of the praying mantis. I like the technique
*  I'm not gonna begrudge
*  Just I don't need to pull the video the grizzly taking down the buffalo was only two days ago
*  It was in Yellowstone linked me to a 30-minute video of it. Just fucking up all sorts of animal or praying mantis
*  By the way, there's so many fucking people
*  Wow, what a weird-looking creature prank mantis is pink he's he's
*  Camouflage himself. Oh
*  Wow, now he's the color the leaf. This is a good point 10 million views on this praying mantis video
*  They're amazing animals men. What are you gonna say? Were you mad about? I?
*  wasn't mad about anything I'm just like
*  You know, I love bears right? Yes. I love when they ride the bikes at the fucking surface
*  This is my thing about that
*  What did they have to do to that bear when you see what this thing can do to a bison?
*  What did they do to that bear to get them to get on a fucking bicycle give them food?
*  That's how they train him is that how you did it
*  I've never got a bear in the back you just a confidence the way you said that cuz I've seen you
*  I've seen the train bears. Yeah, they can train guys who doesn't need any sleep like of all the random fucking things
*  I've seen it. This is the one with the bear. Oh with the whip that little whip there
*  I don't think he's beaten the bear. I'll tell you right now
*  That guy's not dressed to get a fucking to be attacked by a bear
*  No, well the bears got a muzzle on and it's a little ass bear but bear still fuck you man
*  Fuck you. They got the they got the Freddy Krueger claws
*  On all he got four of his on a Vespa now look at that Wow
*  I mean, can you humiliate a bear even more?
*  He's got to wear that frilly outfit now you got a nice didn't give him a motorcycle one
*  Who's a big fan of the bears riding by I was joking me to joke
*  I didn't know maybe I actually
*  Watched a whole training video of how like it's where do you find what part of the internet are you on?
*  Well, I don't know I was I was trying to figure out why people up
*  What the fuck that guy's got a giant grizzly bear on the back of his bike playing a horn
*  It's kind of playing a trumpet cuz he's got any volume on this trumpet. Let me hear this
*  Bag it up there
*  This person that's filming this is an idiot you think it can't break out of that seat belt and just
*  That thing is on a fucking lap belt. Yeah, what is your bear? He's just
*  Imagine this gotta be Russia, right?
*  There's only way they would allow this is in Russia
*  Yeah, yeah, look at the language in the back of that truck. He's yelling at the fucking traffic
*  Jesus Christ, let's fucking go size of that fucking thing. My god. Just throwing his arms up
*  Just thinking about ripping a person apart. No, he is. Yeah, he's thinking like I used to be in the woods
*  Could fucking eat whatever I wanted the weird thing about bears if you train them when they're young
*  They're like almost like dogs. They become your buddy
*  There was weird somebody tells that bear that it's riding bitch that guy fucking that guy riding the motorcycle
*  It's gonna be in trouble he's riding on the side cart. Yeah, he's gonna be in trouble. No side carts
*  Whatever happened to those you never see those motorcycle with the side car. You ever see the racing?
*  No, they do side cart race side car racing and when they go around a turn
*  Okay, and it's on the side where the guy's riding the side is lifted up that guy
*  He has to stand up do they're going like I don't know how many fucking miles an hour
*  He has to stand up and lean over all the way over on this side of the bike because of the weight of the side
*  Car so it doesn't so it doesn't yeah, they can go through the turn at a higher speed. I mean
*  It's bad enough when you're the guy in the car with the map you ever seen those
*  Turn and 100 yards left like yeah, right left. Yeah, those are those rally drivers, right? I never understood that
*  Do you know what they're doing? They're yelling out directions of the road, right?
*  But they have notebooks that tells them like what what's the next turn next turn right?
*  I would guess that the course is so long that they can't memorize it. Hmm
*  Or maybe it's just through a fucking town must be yeah
*  This is a sidecar reason the back of the driver I believe
*  But they're going fast as fuck
*  Oh my god, you're the one who turned me on to those bike races in the Isle of Man I
*  Was supposed to go to that this year. Oh
*  You would be side on the side. Oh, no. No, no no fucking way
*  No, I I planted them to befriend some people in town with a balcony even then like God knows some part of the bike could come
*  Flying up with uh, I want to go to that before they outlaw it
*  And that outlawed just because people die every year more people have died than years. They've had it
*  Whoa, and it's still like look at these motherfuckers. Yes, this is this is so so more than one person dies every year
*  Well, well, right. Yeah, we average yeah, and I think way back in the day way more people died like the safety
*  Equipment is much better. But as you see they're going by brick walls and trees and like it's just no
*  Jesus Christ when you say the safety equipment like what what the fuck kind of safety equipment is gonna save you they yeah
*  Well, they have an airbag
*  Which is a really amazing piece of technology whereas you fall it can tell when you've let go of the bike and you're falling like
*  Instantaneously and it protects your organs. Yeah, but obviously your brains and the fluid so doesn't protect that I
*  Tell you but the best racing out there Moto GP is the shit. It's better than this
*  Um
*  Well, I don't know I I
*  Yeah, I would actually say cuz I like the passing there's so much passing was kind of what with Formula one
*  Wait, where the Mercedes and Ferrari are just so much better than everybody else
*  It kind of comes down to the two of them and every year since I've been watching since 2015
*  So I'm new to the sport Italian GP right here. Yes, that's the vizio. So mark Marquez. I believe you know these guys
*  Yeah, wow, so mark Marquez the guy in second place is like he's the Jordan of the sports, right?
*  Davit's he also is actually in third. I don't know who's in first
*  So those that's a Ducati a Honda Ducati and I think a Suzuki. Do you ride I?
*  Did for three months out here. I always wanted to ride my parents would never let me so finally out here
*  I took a motorcycle safety course
*  I got my license and everything and then I had a bike for like two months and it was just it's LA is not the
*  Place to learn how to ride and everyone was texting while driving
*  Why don't I Wyoming? I think I want to get a dirt bike
*  But this is the type of shit like with this racing what I like is like a three or four races last year on the
*  Final lap there was like two guys that would pass each other like four or five times
*  Like that shit right there
*  So then you try to come on the brakes
*  The
*  latest on the brakes, but not overshoot the turn I mean, there's just so much shit that's
*  You sort of learn as you're watching
*  I still don't know shit about it, but these guys are fucking incredible
*  Would you be into going to a track learning how to ride on a track?
*  That seems like the safest way to do it
*  Absolutely that is the way to do it and then wear all of that gear and then have fun and you can like open up
*  I think Dean sent me a video today. This guy in a Porsche could go 200 miles an hour
*  But he fucking does it on a highway and it's just like you're gonna kill somebody or kill yourself
*  It's like take that thing to the track. Yeah, don't do that and and god forbid you hit some debris
*  Oh, you know, what's gonna happen to your car?
*  Like you I just think I think there's a lot of people that buy high-performance shit that go into a track
*  Either is not available
*  It doesn't enter their mind like something like myself like it wasn't until I started watching racing
*  I kind of learned a little bit about him like oh, there's like a track, you know out in the Inland Empire
*  You know
*  There's there's a day where they like the general public can come down and or whatever you can pay to rent the track
*  And it's kind of like, you know
*  a lot of these guys you see driving around in Ferraris if you ever the only time I ever drove a Ferrari was I drove
*  One in a track it was fucking unbelievable. Like how hard you could stomp on the brakes without the thing locking up and
*  You're trying to impress the guy you're riding with and you think you just want to be like
*  Flooring it and blah blah blah and what you really want to be doing is smoothly
*  Going around the smoother you go both, you know on the gas and braking then it becomes like this really
*  Like finesse thing where it looks like you just grab it by the fucking throat and you know, like I said
*  I only did it one time but like I immediately learned that like made me appreciate what they were doing a lot more plus
*  Yeah, I went around five times and my fucking brain was like the G force. Yeah, I almost felt a little bit
*  Like not sick. I just felt a little fucked up like I think I'm gonna sit down here for a couple of seconds
*  Not say it to any of the guys I'm driving with. Hi. Fine. Fine. I could do that all day
*  Jimmy pull up a Porsche Rally driving the dirt road Porsche drivers. That's those are the guys that are reading left right left, right
*  Right, let me have like a notebook. You need a driver next to you. That's got a notebook
*  That that looks like a lot of fun
*  Apparently that's a great way to learn how to really drive to is on the dirt same with dirt bikes
*  Because you know you slide a lot
*  So you learn how to counter steer and you learn how to how to handle the weight out back
*  The guys it's kicking out I learned how to counter it I have this weird thing where I am
*  Fascinated by machines and I want them everything that I see I want to learn how to
*  Drive it or fly it or whatever, but I'm not a speed guy
*  like I'm just not into like
*  Like smart going fast as I don't know. I don't I like chillin
*  Yeah, these guys see the guys there's the guy with the book. This is a regular road
*  but how fucking so it's got a digital thing telling them what gear he's in and
*  Here's what fascinates me is to trust between those two guys. Oh, yeah
*  Like this guy this guy is driving like a fucking lunatic and this guy's looking down at his paper
*  You know when your friends does driving like a lunatic you're looking at him going dude, dude, slow down slow down
*  This is a road people and trees and cars and houses on both sides
*  This guy's flying down this fucking road and he's going sideways all the time. You see him counter steering all the time
*  We see his ass end kick out like all the time. Yeah, it's amazing
*  Oh my god, and how are these fucking people that are so confident?
*  They can stand on the side of the road while these maniacs are fucking I used to think racing was just this stupid mindless thing
*  And now I think it's one of the coolest sports out there. Oh, it's a very cool sport
*  It's very I like driving cars just to feel the mechanical
*  Just the gears moving and all the things that are happening. I have a an old Porsche on 93
*  That's no power steering. It doesn't have a radio. It doesn't have anything. That's awesome, and it's all air-cooled. So it sounds like
*  It's really mechanical here see I'll show it to you after we're done that red one. Yeah. Yeah
*  I should have the key with me here. I'd let you drive it. It's fun as fuck, but it's not fast
*  Doesn't it's not it's the slowest car I have but it's fun
*  It's so fun to drive like you feel everything you feel every bump
*  There's no nothing between you and the wheels in terms of steering there's no power you're steering the wheel all by your hands really
*  Hard to steer. It's not that safe either. Yeah, you can't make quick turns like you got a really muscle that motherfucker
*  I'm like I'm into like these guys. Oh Jesus Christ
*  But when I drive look at these fucking crazy assholes standing by with the propeller hat. He's just like yep. I'm a fucking idiot
*  I'm enjoying this though. Look at the fucking height and this guy catches the ground with two wheels. Oh my god
*  Does it land good? It does land good. That's amazing
*  But I drive that car to the comedy store
*  It's my if I want to do like if I'm really working on something or I really want to be jazzed up for a set
*  I'll take that car to the comedy store because it's so loud and fucking smoky and
*  Everything's like your whole body feel it you like you're excited when you get there. It's like you're on a stimulant
*  Yeah, no, it's it's it's fun man. I love that stuff
*  Look at these guys you should like
*  You know since the last time I did this this show I got to finally fly
*  In a star which was what the cops and the news guys fly and that was that was the coolest thing a star helicopter
*  We should tell people is is the coolest thing I've ever flown as far as like
*  Just the power and compared to what I would you know, I fly these little fucking egg beaters or whatever
*  But like I did until all that bullshit happened
*  But I got one of the last flights I did I got to fly a buddy of mine who was training me to get my instrument
*  Like I passed the test
*  And then after you pass the test you have two years, so I still have two years
*  I have to December of next year to pass it. So I got to finish that part of it
*  You know, did we do a podcast since you took me up?
*  Have you done one since you took me up? I think we did. I think we did. Yeah, dude, Jamie. Yeah, fuck
*  That was fun. We went over downtown LA and you realize how many of those buildings are
*  Helicopter spots on the top. Yeah, that was fun, man
*  It's just it's crazy to me that with a helicopter you could just kind of go wherever you want to go
*  Yeah, he has fucking float around just go wherever you want to go
*  You can just stop it. It's but what but then what it is is you give up speed
*  Yeah for that design you give up. He has all kinds of drag and just the way it's designed for what you want to do with it
*  You give up speed so I get
*  You give up speed so I get
*  Envious of planes or even if you get like a Cessna like they can just fly
*  though, I mean I think even like the
*  Some of the smaller ones can fly faster than the some of the faster hell
*  I mean you'd have to have like eight million of a helicopter
*  Maybe that could fly faster but anything that I've fucked with you can't come anywhere near like most of them
*  120 130 knots and then it depends on
*  Headwind a tailwind. What's a knot to a mile an hour?
*  Well, it's it's like it depends on how the wind because you can literally be flying 90 knots and have like a fucking 50
*  No, but not what I fly but a significant headwind
*  This is all shit
*  You have to know in the test and the second you you take the test you fucking I forget but you'll actually be going slower
*  I've had times like especially out like in like palm desert and stuff where there's like a venturi with the way the mountains are and
*  when the fucking
*  The wind comes in which can be really fucking scary as far as how it throws you around you're looking down at the highway
*  With what I fly and they're going faster than you and you just sit there like and then that's when it sucks
*  Because also with a helicopter you you the whole thing you can't just like take your hands off his shit
*  So you have to you you're literally it's like your Porsche like you're you know, I'm imagining like
*  Trying to parallel park that car even though it's a lighter car. It's a nightmare
*  I have a 68 Ford F-100 when I first had it
*  I didn't have power steering dude and it was just like I mean
*  I remember when you bought that thing to the ice house that thing is the shit. Yeah, I love that old truck
*  That's kind of my thing. I like the trucks and then I like
*  old like
*  Not pimp cars like the guy who is a pimp, but he's not a pimp like like
*  You know what? I mean? Like not literally a pimp. He doesn't have a stable of bitches
*  but he's crushing life like I like that car like
*  Like if I was gonna get another car I would get a 67 Cadillac Eldorado
*  Oh, it's actually the color that I loved that was in that the Tarantino movie
*  But somebody was selling one and I swear to God if it by the time I saw the YouTube video was already sold
*  I would have bought that fucking car. It's the most gangster
*  Man's car like just the back end of that car. It's it's perfection. I absolutely love that fucking car
*  That's a beautiful car 67 Eldorado. Would you get a convertible or regular? No, I hate convertibles
*  Do you really all convertibles?
*  Yeah, I kind of I got it. I'm a little sexist with the convertible
*  There's one convertible that I like the one that I have the 65 Corvette. No, no that's not that that's a 70
*  No, no, that's that's a year. Is that it's it's the car that the the woman playing
*  Margo, what's any Margot Robbie? There it is. There it is. There it is
*  There's right there that looks like it's green there, but I think it was blue
*  Not that no not that one over the gap the suspenders right to the left of that
*  Yeah, that one there that car oh wow you got to see the back end of that car that um, that's a late the 67
*  68 or something like that, but the back end look up 67 Cadillac Eldorado rear end
*  This is what I do while you're learning how to train it fucking bear to ride a bicycle. I look at this shit
*  Click on that first one click on the first one. We see a little bit of the side of the car
*  I mean look at that. That's beautiful
*  That is beautiful. You need one of those in your life bill. I do I need you driving one of those
*  This is what I love about my wife as I'll show her that ago. What do you think about that?
*  She's like that's a fucking good-looking car and she would be cool if I got something like that. I think for sure
*  Yeah, but look at that color. I'm too fair skin to drive that you need olive skin. No more
*  You could pull it off. You can pull it off. You need one of them paperboy hats though
*  No, that that thing would that thing would fucking that thing would blend too much in with my beard
*  I just look like it'd be the ginger mobile
*  How would you get there? There's a year they got there's a there's a blue that they have
*  It's not that blue it's more it's more of a look at that red one click on that red one the middle
*  But look at the front end and I go when your lights have flipped out. Look at that thing
*  Look how good that looks in red
*  That's a fucking beautiful car. Oh
*  But the lines on that car that's just like and then that's the kind of coming you're not gonna smoke a cigar driving on the
*  Street riding that fucking you have to yeah
*  That's beautiful. I think I'm gonna get one get one
*  I know where am I gonna put it then I'm gonna be that guy with the fucking garage put it here
*  You can park it here. I'll give you a key. I
*  Got a room. Hey, all right
*  Dude, this is why you're the number one podcast in the world. I'm trying to help people
*  I'm trying to encourage
*  Irresponsible behavior and if you continue to own your podcast you can buy something like that
*  And if you don't your fucking agent will buy that
*  Yeah, I love them I love Cadillac convertibles to though I don't like
*  Muscle car convertibles after a certain you like mine that Corvette that I have out there. You've seen that silver one
*  Yeah, I love that in a convertible, but that has a aftermarket suspension and aftermarket frame
*  I've seen I've seen all those cars. I thought the fact that the old ones those frame
*  It's too there's too much bounce. There's too much shake and wiggle. You have to have like an aftermarket chassis
*  It's far stiffer. They make it so that it's like very very rigid
*  It doesn't bounce around there
*  It's much then they should make like a sway bar or something that you would put in there because I know in my truck when
*  I take a turn I have to grab underneath the seat
*  They can upgrade your coil overs and stuff like that and put a better suspension
*  I I have a nice balance of a little bit of modern on it and still fighting it
*  So you feel like because it still shifts on the column, which I think is badass
*  But then when I get on the highway, I got to stay in the right lane, you know three on the tree, right?
*  Yeah, do you have disc brakes on it? Do you swap disc brakes out? I had
*  it had it had just the shoes on it and then drums the drum brakes, yeah, and then I
*  converted those crisp a Titus helped me with those and
*  Then what did I do after that I switched out the radiator because they tended to run hot so they put an aluminum one in
*  and
*  What else did we do to it tight? It's to have power brakes and then power steering Titus used to have us sweet
*  I think it was a 55 Chevy that they made for him on the show rides
*  It was incredible. Oh that chip Foose car. Yeah, I think chip Foose made it. Yeah, it was incredible though
*  Just I don't know if he still has it
*  He might have lost it when he got divorced and all that jazz, but it was no I think he got it back
*  Did he I think he got it back, but I like those Christopher Titus, I like those those resto mod
*  Cars is sort of the perfect. There it is. There it is. Look at that fucking thing. Yeah, that's pretty well
*  That is a work of art
*  God, it's beautiful. That's it's all very modified to 56 Bel Air
*  Custom by chip foos go down Jamie and that one on the left hand right there with Titus right there
*  I think that's him. Yeah, look at that. Fuck. I mean, that's a badass car
*  That is incredible
*  Yeah car is incredible. Like when do you like look at that or drive that and not smile? Yeah, that's what I I don't know
*  I like also
*  I'm into those cab over engine fucking trucks. I like weird shit cab over engine. What is that? Look those up
*  Those are those were the trucks
*  40s and 50s and the reason why they had that was there was some weird law where they didn't want trucks to get too long
*  So then that affected did it so they kept the tractor trail along and then they put the engine
*  It's cab over engine is what it stands for. So the engines below you while you're sitting there
*  Yeah, so if you look at some of the ones that people have fixed up, they're fucking wild. That is wild. Look at that thing. Yeah
*  Wow, but the thing is if you do a gig in like Wyoming you can find an all original one
*  Just like sitting in like junkyards and shit
*  Look at that fucking thing god damn that's like I always wish like one of those car shows like fast and loud the ones
*  I've watched throughout the years. I always wish that somebody would do one of those I had that guy on the podcast
*  He was awesome. Yeah, he brought his own tequila. There's another great one from when I was a kid that that yellow one down
*  That's a Ford
*  Yep, I love those cuz that was like the fire engines look like that thing
*  But it's like what would you do with it? But they drive around that thing to the store
*  It's for sale gateway classic cars, I know but that's that's like the dumb shit
*  I like those like those kind of the GMC RV from stripes and you got to do it in the palm desert
*  Fucking the the the Ron Burgundy green you like very odd
*  Cars. Yeah. Well at first I think you you're into Mustangs and you're into fucking like the GTO's and the ones you're supposed to like
*  Yeah, and then I'll ignore what you just did there
*  And then I mean look at that you got to get the interior on that fucking thing. It's a Scooby-Doo mobile
*  That's the mystery mobile. No, they had a van
*  You okay click on click on the one you're on the right the lower left all the way to lower left
*  From the cluster on the right
*  Yeah
*  Click on that fucking thing. No, that's not it. See you see you did not
*  Which one you want it's the one it's the best green one they have just click there it is look at that
*  And inside it looks like a Ron Burgundy suit like it's the green plaid type shit
*  Get a little humidor in there drive around do some fun. Look at that. Come on, man. That's the fucking shit
*  So you like those old cars like GTO's and I like all of those but like what I don't like about them is
*  The baby boomers like them and they have a zillion dollars. So then all of a sudden it's like, you know
*  This is a Mustang Shilvy. I'm gonna start the bidding at two hundred fifty thousand dollars. It's like oh fuck yourself. So I
*  like
*  You know, I like a 65 Ford Galaxy, that's what Frank Murphy season 4 episode family. That's what he drives
*  I like station wagons. Have you ever seen those icon thrift masters? Do you know what that is?
*  Jonathan Ward the guy from icon he takes an old thrift master and
*  Redos it and they completely from the bottom up. It's the fucking most incredible car
*  It drives like a car, but that look at that. It looks insane
*  Look at that thing
*  They in the they do it from the bottom up. So it's all like modern brakes modern suspension beautiful interior
*  That's what I love but then when you go in inside
*  I want it to look like the year that that truck was look at that silver one the one that right above your cursor
*  Yeah, look at that. Yeah, I've seen actually I looked at one. I accidentally came upon that one. That's beautiful
*  I got another one. It's a weird one. Look up GMC. I always think of the name of these things were a parade of progress
*  That's what it's called. I figured that's they would drive these things like elephants into town. They were like a living room
*  giant like truck slash RV thing
*  The fuck are these things called?
*  Yeah, wait up that thing look at that fucking thing. What the fuck?
*  How do you even know about this?
*  So so the great thing is you open the door and there's like a spiral
*  Staircase where you you go up and in there what they usually had was back in the day because they would open it up on
*  The side they would they would drive him in like elephants and make like a semicircle and people would walk in
*  And is that I don't know what I don't know what they have in there
*  That's it. Yeah, that's an airplane engine or something. Why is there an airplane engine in the middle of that?
*  I don't know cuz somebody
*  They customized it power for the air age. I think they were it was this weird sort of
*  After World War two see there they are in the black and white there
*  They are like driving it in driving them into town
*  And look at the steering wheel you were right in the center and there was like a little spiral staircase that you walked up
*  Cuz those things go for like I
*  Forget how much like two three million bucks or something. Oh, that's 1936. It says parade of progress
*  So shows you what I'm gonna get that motherfucker. Yeah, that's just weird shit
*  That's so that's what you want one of those a rolling podcast studio
*  No, that shit is too weird, but I I appreciate it like when you know that old BMW
*  Where the the whole front of the car opens up and you got it the steering wheel like goes out like disconnects and goes out
*  With the front other coming that one
*  All right. I just it would help if I knew the names of the cars
*  the steering wheel disconnects
*  Mm-hmm
*  That's it yeah, that's how look at this so how you get in is you you like open the front oh
*  Yeah, click on the red one. There it is. Yeah
*  This is steering wheel. Oh, does it disconnect? There's something weird
*  It seems like the steering wheel stays but it looks like it disconnects
*  Well, maybe like it adjusts it comes back you enter through the so if you get in a front-end
*  Collision you got to kick the windows out to get out of the car. Yeah, and it's three wheels, too
*  There's one
*  Urkel I forgot about Urkel
*  His came off in the car. I met him one time. He's like the coolest fucking guy already. He's really nice
*  I guess it bends over there. You see how it's turned down to the side. Oh
*  It bends and then you step over it. Whoa. Yeah, I knew there was something
*  There was something about the steering wheel. Yeah, there's a lot of weird shit out there, but you like weird stuff
*  You're not necessarily like you you you know what this is like to cool things
*  No
*  It's like if you get into music if you really get into a band
*  Like if you're into AC DC, right, can you really listen to you shook me all night long again?
*  Okay, you're like no dude. You got to listen to what's next to the moon get it hot some of them, you know
*  Or like COD. Mm-hmm. Like I like after a while you just like all right, you know
*  like I would say shook me all night long is the Mustang GT of AC DC songs and
*  It's just like if you're out here, there's a zillion Mustangs
*  But it's like you after a while you want you want to see you know, it's part of human beings
*  You want something a little bit different? It's a little different. It's cooler. Like I kind of learned from fast and loud that the
*  Is it the Ford Falcon or something had the same chassis as the fucking Mustang?
*  but like it's just a way cooler car because
*  Everybody goes for like the Mustang you I mean
*  You know, you're you're gonna spend all that money and then some other fucking asshole shows up and he has one, too
*  That doesn't bother me. Ah
*  Bugs me
*  Take a second. You're in a comedy club and then see if even if somebody just touches on the topic
*  You're like, I can't talk about that. Yes, I get that cuz then it becomes like oh they all do that
*  I get that but there's a reason why everybody loves Mustangs
*  I love them too, but I have this weird thing where I love the interior up to 66
*  But I like the back end on 60 with 67 68. Yeah, I like that back in but I hate but that's when they got this shit
*  steering wheel like the steering wheel and like in in the 60s looks like an old-school steering wheel and that one that they have in
*  67 or 68 was when they first came out with that one that one starts to look like oh cars are gonna get ugly now
*  the last muscle car that I like that that I
*  Vividly remember like the last year would probably the 70 Camaro with like that shark nose front. Oh, yeah
*  I like that and then there's a few there's a Buick Riviera the boat tail from the early 70s that I like
*  I'm really into those big two-door sedan sort of like
*  You know, he's his own man
*  Era. Oh, yeah, I love those cars. I fucking love those cars and
*  You know, I'm trying to think like there's a few cars in the 80s
*  They really tapers off though, but I like Ford trucks right up into 86
*  I didn't like when they did the first that first design of the aerodynamic headlights
*  I didn't like but then there was one in the early 90s
*  The one OJ had that front end on his Bronco that one is the shit. Yeah, I saw one yesterday exactly
*  Like like your OJ's like totally restored. I
*  Like muscle cars up into 71
*  71 seems like the last year like 71 Barracuda still a really nice car then it gets into 72. They start looking sketchy 73
*  They look sketchy
*  Worse thing was they kept the they kept the model name and then it was just completely deballed
*  Yes, like when your friend starts going out with just some total cunt and all of a sudden he can't hang out anymore
*  Like there was that era, you know the Mustang to Cobra
*  Oh, yeah, once they got into the 80s with Mustang through a useless the set late late 70s early 80s
*  And once the gas crisis hit they started making
*  Economical Mustangs Mustangs that didn't eat so much gas. They were useless
*  It's just a it's a hard fall between if you go from 67 to 77
*  It's like what the fuck happened to you then also the Mustang got all fat like the Mach 1 and everything. It just it was like
*  Kind of got into its Elvis years, you know, hey, I'm the Mustang. I'm resting on my laurels here
*  Well, there's no pizzazz to them, you know, like late late 70s 79 Mustang. There's no pizzazz
*  This is how bad it went
*  It became so quickly if you watch like the remember they the game show network
*  I used to love that cuz I was in fascinated with prices
*  You know and like they would be like like they actually tried to pass off a Chevy Vega as a sports car
*  And these people were losing their minds and I remember the Chevy Vega
*  Like a lot of like, you know guys who knew shit about cars back in the day
*  They would try to like jam Corvette engines into me because they couldn't afford a Corvette
*  So they but they knew about you know how to build cars and stuff. So there was always were real light, too
*  Yeah, there was always somebody had one of those like an El Camino up on blocks
*  Yeah, I'm gonna finish that someday man. Yeah, and the El Camino is a rare breed a person that wants a pickup truck
*  That's fucked a Chevelle
*  That's really what it is. It's like a Chevelle front end
*  It looks good in the front and then you get to the back like oh and then I and then the early the 80s
*  Look at that Vega. Yeah, that was considered sporty. That's back for girls had butts
*  Well girls with butts didn't get put on TV, not funny. Yeah, that's another amazing thing
*  Like how do we what what what happened where we realize was it sir mix a lot like woke us up
*  Yeah, he made the ass mainstream. I'm gonna give him credit might have been
*  Before that who else was it?
*  It was all about tits, yeah white guys were running shit and it was about tits I
*  Don't know why it was all about titties something happened something happened it became
*  Asses became really important because then I think like yeah because now the fake ass I think is probably more prevalent
*  Than the fake titty like remember by the 90s was like sort of the apex of the fake titty
*  He'd watch porn and the tit almost looked like bloodshot. They'd be like veins on the side like they'd stretch the skin
*  You see oh, yeah, that was really bad. That was a really bad. You have fat bottom girls before that
*  Yeah
*  I don't think yeah, they didn't he was still Freddie Mercury Prince around in the video. I think yeah good song though
*  Yeah, what was it like?
*  Where who's like no it wasn't Jennifer?
*  Well guys was no one God bless us because I was always an ass man always
*  I was just felt like that was the nucleus of a woman if she had a nice ass the rest of her body was gonna
*  Be nice. I'd give a shitty guy a cup tasty great. They won't be hanging on your fucking knees when I'm 50
*  bald smoking a cigar doing a podcast
*  It's weird though that this is like the shape caught on
*  It's very strange like the what what's injured what what guys are attracted to changed well, I think because
*  White people were so dominant with fucking owning everything that their idea of beauty became
*  The standard and just generally speaking idea beauty changed to that's what's strange
*  It's like I would say it's somewhere yo MTV wraps somewhere around there
*  Just making up shit somewhere around there. I'm gonna give Ed lover and the other dr. Dre credit
*  I think it's it happened around the same time girls lost their pubes
*  Because when we were in high school all everyone had pubes even in college everyone had pubes the apex of pubes was the 70s
*  Yeah, but you were but you were proud of your pubes in the 70s. Yeah
*  Dude, I remember like you'd go to the fucking public pool and the chicks had like the Bikini was like shit coming out the sides
*  And I remember thinking while little kid like oh my god, you can see your pubes
*  Yeah pubes were yeah
*  Now pubes are discussed there was muffs if you're a girl and you got a full bush now you're a dangerous woman
*  But then I would say
*  That that was probably
*  Dr. J in the ABA crossing over made women proud of their muffs
*  There's no research we just started talking just making this up
*  But there's it there is a clear shift that happened. It's just like what happened
*  What made that clear shift porn caused the people to get rid of the pubes?
*  That's definitely what happened because porn led the way they trimmed the pubes first and then everybody trimmed the pubes now
*  I went too far
*  Yeah, now no one that you know, then it went too far. Yeah too far. Yeah, like a little bush
*  Yeah, I would like yeah, you should look like a woman. Yeah. Yeah
*  Not like a cancer patient. Yeah. Yeah
*  Listen if you bang me, I'm just happy
*  Happy you showed up God bless you take it on for the tea. You can find beauty and everything
*  But when I was a kid, I mean
*  Everyone had pubes
*  It was a thing
*  It is. Oh, that's a weird
*  Weird moment in our culture that we all just decided pubes are disgusting. I
*  Think more that they need to be maintained. Yes, if there's gonna be a camera an eighth of an inch from it and then
*  I
*  Gynacological yeah, so so what's this movie did? I did this movie's called the King of Staten Island
*  Judd Apatow Pete Davidson. Look at your mustache. Oh, yeah. Oh you need one of those in your life
*  Why don't you grow one of those?
*  Keep it
*  It was really annoying to eat with cuz club soda Kenny told me I thought cuz he was the guy
*  I was saying am I doing this this right here cuz there's a whole way to grow it where it's like he goes
*  All right
*  He goes if you're gonna do the cop fireman one he goes the hair has to go over the over your top lip
*  mmm, and Kenny had all these great old IDs from when he was a cop and
*  What is this movie about it's it's sort of autobiographical
*  Of
*  Pete Davidson's life where he's playing a kid whose dad is a firefighter who died in a fire
*  It's not 9-eleven like Pete's real dad
*  And it's basically his mom hasn't dated they just sort of froze
*  Which I you know, I think was something that kind of happened
*  In his family and then all of a sudden his mother started dating and it was weird for him. So basically
*  His mother
*  You know through whatever circumstances don't ruin it. I end up meeting her after me and Pete, you know his character
*  I don't like his and I'm coming to his house to fucking yell or whatever and then I see
*  His his mom played by Marissa Tomei and then all of a sudden, you know, you know, we click or whatever
*  We start dating whatever and then he fucking hates it and the comedy ensues
*  But it's you know, it's got a lot of heart, you know, it's not a hundred percent comedy but
*  Yeah, Marissa Tomei Dom Lombardozi
*  Steve Buscemi no, it's streaming everywhere except Netflix
*  It's it's gonna be like it's like that movie that kid movie trolls
*  Whatever they did is what Universal is doing with this one where it's gonna be anywhere where you can stream movies
*  So it's supposed to be in the movie theater
*  It was gonna be movie theater and then all this stuff happened
*  Yeah, so then people who make movies are deciding we're gonna hold on to some of this stuff
*  Which are doing with some movies this thing fortunately they're gonna put out there it is
*  Apple TV Verizon YouTube Google Play
*  Amazon Prime basically why wouldn't Netflix hop on board with this? Come on Netflix
*  Um, I don't think it's a come on Netflix thing. I think eventually will probably end up there
*  But I think first they do this. This is the way they're gonna get their box office
*  I guess you get it on Microsoft. How many people are buying movies on Microsoft? You'd be surprised I would be that's why I'm asking
*  There would be I would think
*  I
*  Such an easy answer you'd be surprised that's like a pulp that was like a political answer I had no answer for you
*  So I want that show
*  Many people are buying it on Microsoft
*  Yeah, so do you think this is a good thing that movies are being forced to stream? I kind of like it
*  I mean, I don't want movie theaters to go under but I do like the option of being able to watch a newly released movie
*  at home
*  Yeah, I think everything's gonna adapt but I don't think the movie theater is ever gonna go away cuz I I still enjoy
*  Going to the movies. It's also it's a way to get out of the house. You get a sitter
*  You're you reconnect with your wife. That's right. We're friends popcorn. This is fun. All of a sudden your jokes come back, right?
*  You're having fun. Oh, I mean anytime I hang with my wife like if we get like a couple days away
*  It the magic instant instant comes back and then when we get back to the high house
*  It's like the grind again and we just start laughing
*  We gotta remember you gotta remember those two days
*  So the key is to have those two day little things enough that you don't forget it
*  So you don't start fucking growing apart. You guys do date nights? Yeah
*  Yeah
*  I like night nights with my wife and we were doing them when I was
*  When I was at the store all the time when comedy was up
*  I was doing them on Saturday night
*  Because she didn't have to get up early in the morning for the kids take the kids to school so she could be rested and
*  Refresh didn't have to go to school the next day. So didn't have to get up on Sunday
*  So it was a good day. So I just would take Sunday off a stand-up
*  Yeah, we do date nights and this is the thing as much as women seem impossible to guys
*  Especially someone like me with all my fucking issues. It's like just something like that
*  Does wonders? Yeah for your your connection and
*  Then we also had like once a week we were doing like
*  Before we got pregnant again
*  We were doing a family dinner and that was the best and what we were going to was a bunch of like
*  Just mom-and-pop places in like the valley and out in Pasadena and stuff like that of these places that are just you know
*  Legendary and you know in that area, but they don't have a chain
*  So it's cool because you feel like you're giving you know regular people
*  Money and business and we would go there and when like that was a big thing when I was growing up before you had all
*  These screens and all of this shit going out to dinner with your family. Yeah, I'm gonna be an excited
*  They used to have this chain in Massachusetts remember pewter pot
*  Yeah, they basically they made muffins somehow
*  They were a chain that made muffins and then they expanded into having full dinners and everything was made out of wood
*  It was very like 70s and that was like a big thing
*  My dad came I were going to pewter pot tonight and you were like sight
*  And I would always get whatever like cheeseburger fries and then a blueberry muffin
*  Such a weird order, but I was a kid and you wouldn't get fat. It was fucking awesome
*  so I want my kids to
*  Have a little bit of that. Mm-hmm that sort of I'm probably romancing it
*  But I think it's it's because it was for my childhood, but I think it's an important thing to do shit like that
*  Yeah, I'm a big fan of mom-and-pop restaurants
*  There's a place we used to go to in Woodland Hills called Brandywine and the owner
*  Peggy and Chris the owners there was the owners one the female owner was the chef and the male owner was the maitre d'
*  And they were a married couple they've been together forever and they went when we met them. They were probably I
*  Want to say in their 70s like pretty deep in their server
*  There was there were already fair fairly along pretty far down the road then they eventually sold the place
*  They sold the place when it was sad, you know, and then some new people bought it
*  But I think it went under now, but I was a great little place a small place
*  It didn't see very many you know, I get over that sadness
*  I get old cuz that shit really used to depress me
*  What I look at was like, you know when they opened this restaurant and they were young there was old people that were upset
*  About whatever they cleared out and it just happens. You know what I mean? Like well, I was just upset that I couldn't see them
*  You know, I just enjoyed their company. It was it was always you know, we have been going there for ten years
*  It was one of those places. What I do is I take the humanity out of it Joe
*  It's a cycle of life. Yeah, it's just like the praying mantis and the lizard. I know dude
*  I tell you this fucking this fucking
*  This whole quarantine thing really I like I
*  Never realized what a fucking idiot I am
*  You're just everything I'm doing. Why the fuck did I just do this?
*  Why did this need to fucking be on here? You want why Joe? No big deal. You're a clean freak or something
*  Give me I'm I'm cutting up his ashes like it's coke
*  Yeah, that takes it back to Chelsea going around the apex
*  I have a cocaine memory from I never did coke but uh of this lady doing it
*  I was coming home from Kelly's Rose beef Joe Rogan coke Wow, that's what I'm saying
*  I'm smart enough to realize it's not for me. Yeah. What about me? Yeah, we were driving
*  I like I can snap on weed. I
*  Don't need to be doing coke
*  We didn't espresso and you're ready to fight
*  We were driving back from Kelly's roast beef, do you remember Kelly's Roast Beef from Revere? Yeah, great
*  You know, it's so funny. I don't think I ever went there really
*  I drove by it a million times always going by Cappy's Lickers on the way up to the car
*  Oh, it was people's great. Remember Cappy's Lickers. Yeah, I do. Yeah near the Kowloon. Yeah, you drive up there
*  Kelly's roast beef had clams too. Didn't they have clams those fried clams?
*  I always that was one of those places I meant to get to I always meant to get to that and then that steakhouse with
*  the giant cactus
*  What the fuck was that?
*  Yes, and I was gonna eat there someday
*  I always asked my I just loved the cows the fake cows out front and we were living on the North Shore then so we
*  Would drive my dad into work and we would always go down route 1
*  And we would go buy that and I would think like, you know
*  And there was also a hockey rink up there that had a Bruins emblem that they were allowed to use before like all the
*  Corporate people really like you can't use our logo. So they're Bruins thing and I was convinced that's where the Bruins practiced
*  I went to Hilltop steakhouse once and it was for some reason I have it connected in my mind with a
*  boxing match that was on TV because I was so bummed out a
*  Sugar Ray Leonard fought Terry Norris and
*  That I was that name I should say Terry Norris was a monster
*  And so we'll show it so was sugar ray when he was in his prime
*  But he got older and he fought Terry Norris and Terry Norris was a fucking just a demon
*  He was so good and sugar ray just had no business fighting him and I remember eating food just being bummed out just
*  Just thinking fuck is this just what happens to all these guys like like they all decide
*  They all decide one more fight one more fight
*  Let me let me do any came back and beat a few see if you can find that
*  Can you imagine if your body broke down in around 35? You couldn't do stand-up anymore. You definitely try to go for one more set
*  Yeah, but it's different. It's different. It is
*  It's the same you're right. It's Terry Terry Norris totally different was in his prime and he was just so fast and elite and
*  Sugar Ray was just I want to say he was like 38 or something like that
*  I don't know how old he was but it was it was hard to watch
*  From Madison Square Garden in New York City, but that's not something I when I think of sugar ray Leonard
*  I don't think I mean what what about that division he was in? Oh my god
*  herns Duran and Leonard and
*  Well, he fought Hagler long, you know, I mean he came back and fought Hagler and then Hagler retired
*  After that one loss. He just like I'm good, but it was just watching Terry Norris. Yeah, I went to Italy started making movies
*  Yeah, hilarious movies. I got a buddy of mine that is convinced that fight was fixed
*  I think by the Italian mob and then his payoff was they gave him a movie career in Italy. It might be true
*  Your buddy might be right. There's something about it that I've watched
*  I'm like man almost looks like haggard's taking something off of his punches and also I just don't see him doing that
*  I don't think I don't see him ever doing that. That's why I also didn't see him retiring
*  I think he might have gotten fucked on a decision on that fight because that fight could I really felt could have I was
*  Such a herns. I'm a Hagler fan and I also what about what about Tommy herns being as tall as he was but could make that weight?
*  Mm-hmm
*  When he fought sugar ray, I think he was only 22 and he was
*  147 sugar ray stopped him after Angelo Dundee gave him that that speech in the corner. You're blowing it kid
*  Remember that I'll never forget that I you know the one I remember one of the greatest ones. I saw a corner guy was that
*  Corallis Castillo fight oh
*  And when he gets in the corner and he'd been knocked down
*  For like I don't know how many times kept spitting out his mouthpiece and they took away a point or something
*  He goes into his corner and I remember his
*  Manager whatever we call a guy is in the corner. He goes he goes you better fucking get inside now
*  I don't even know what that means. I forget he said that and then this fucking guy Charlie Murphy rest his soul
*  Told me about that fight. He's like Bill. You got to see this fight. He goes I woke up my whole family
*  It was a wild ass fight and he actually Charlie. He was such a funny guy man. He hurt his foot
*  That's how much he was into it
*  Like when he came back after getting knocked down and then knocked out the other guy I always forget Carl's Castillo was
*  Corallis is the guy I won that fight right? Well, they fought more than once I believe
*  Do Corallis yeah, he's the guy and he died on a motorcycle exactly
*  Yeah, terrible. Yeah, I'll tell you an underrated fight when I back this back when I had time
*  I used to watch this shit was a
*  Vandal Holyfield verse Michael Dokes
*  Oh, yeah, that was a great one a great fight Holyfield on so many great fights
*  What do you think was a that guy was a warrior is yeah coming back?
*  Do you know that I don't want to see that he's training Mike Mike Tyson's training. They're both training
*  In their 50s. Yeah, here it is
*  Michael Dokes
*  Yeah, it was I mean it's just an amazing how much longevity Holyfield had and Holyfield started as a cruiserweight
*  I remember when he beat Dwight Muhammad kawi for the cruiserweight title and then gained all this weight
*  Yeah
*  Oh up
*  I mean when he was a cruiserweight in the 80s when I was lifting and I was young and all that shit
*  I was like, that's that's the body I want that's what I'm going for. Of course, I couldn't get it
*  But I was like, that's the shape I want to be it. How stupid I look if I fucking look like that
*  You look amazing going on stage telling jokes just wear something that covers it up a little bit what a poncho
*  Like going over the big square by Josie Wales, yeah
*  You flip it over and you got a mic you take it out
*  Yeah, oh my god, this is round two look at the people standing up
*  I mean this shit was just did you so now watch jokes? Oh
*  Right hand that's it. They stop it. That was it. You're still
*  Richard Steele was the same guy that stopped Julio Cesar Chavez and Meljic Taylor with like two seconds left to go in the final round
*  when
*  Meljic Taylor was up on the fight and Julio Cesar Chavez dropped him Meljic Taylor got up and
*  Richard see was like
*  Are you are you ready to go on? He has more muscle in his trapeze?
*  Whatever the fuck that's called and I traps I have in my whole fucking body
*  He's
*  Specimen Holyfield was a specimen. What's interesting about Holyfield, too?
*  He was like the first guy that ever really put weight on
*  Successfully like he had this this crazy strength and conditioning program that he did to go up to heavyweight
*  Where you know, he was fairly thin when he was a cruiserweight and started lifting weights and lifting weights back then
*  Most people thought lifting weights was terrible for you. There was a lot that was a big thing in basketball. Don't lift weights
*  It's gonna fuck up your shot. They thought you were gonna like send the ball past the well
*  You know what it is
*  It's from being stiff and sore when you're stiff and sore it does fuck you up
*  It's it fucks you up with boxing it fucks you up everything
*  But it's a matter of doing it correctly so that you your body recovers enough so that when you actually fight you're not stiff and sore
*  But you have all that extra muscle. This is great. By the way cars fights cigars cigars praying mantises men stuff
*  Come on. Yes. I love it, right
*  Yeah
*  Yeah, though that that era of boxing man, those are the the golden era when we were kids my god
*  You know ABC wide world of sports. Yeah, get up and watch the fights. Yeah, I'm watching the Leon Spinks
*  Muhammad Ali they showed it on TV must have been a replay. I remember watching that and just kept thinking Muhammad Ali was gonna come back
*  It was the one that he lost. Yeah
*  Against Leon Spinks. I also remember the the the Mike Tyson
*  Michael Spinks fight and I remember the pizza didn't even get there
*  And I remember my buddy was all excited dude
*  My dad ordered the fight and they had just finished their basement and we went downstairs and we were sitting there to watch it
*  It was over in like 90 seconds
*  Yeah, and I just my buddy he got off the couch and he was on all fours like an inch from the TV
*  Just screaming what the fuck?
*  What the fuck?
*  Because we didn't understand there wasn't the education
*  Mainstream education of what a body blow did to you
*  So unless somebody got hit in the head and then that mouthpiece went flying
*  We didn't understand because that last shotty was a hook to the body and you didn't understand
*  Like literally their internal organs just slammed to the other side of their rib cage. You didn't understand that that was happening
*  Here it is. Here's the whole fight
*  Yeah, this was an amazing amazing moment because Spinks was another guy who went up from light heavyweight beat Larry Holmes and then became the heavyweight
*  Champion then was fighting Tyson, but yeah, we were yelling this Spinks jinx because we just wanted it
*  We're rooting for Tyson, but we wanted to see a fight
*  Spinks had a good right hand, but he just you could see he's he's paralyzed here
*  I mean he's fighting a guy that's just so much bigger than him and he's getting smashed
*  Mike Tyson was just such a force of nature at the time. Yeah, Spinks just really had no business fighting legitimate heavyweights
*  he fought Larry Holmes and Larry was past his prime and
*  You know beat Larry by decision
*  But I thought he beat him bad I felt like that was like oh no
*  You know I'm thinking of was was the time Holmes fought Ali
*  Yes, and he was looking over at the ref like what the fuck are you gonna stop this?
*  That was bad people to that to the end of Larry Holmes career didn't appreciate him because that they they loved Ali so much
*  So he heard him with this right hand here, and then he's swarming on him. I
*  Remember seeing this video of Muhammad Ali promoting here it is right here
*  Boom body shot he goes down
*  Spinks gets up
*  Referee gives him an eight count. He says I'm fine. Oh, I thought he went down on that
*  No, that was a body shot, and then he gets hit with a right hand right here Tyson steps bang there it is
*  Oh, that was oh see I forgot about that. Yeah
*  He's just like fuck this man
*  Like fuck this dude you realize the fucking balls it takes to fucking walk. Oh you do you did it Jesus Christ?
*  I mean those guys you walk into an arena shirtless scary. That's fucking amazing
*  What's really scary is it's like you think about it for weeks and weeks up to it and obviously I never did it at this
*  Level but at that level when the whole world is watching and you know that this is a just an enormous moment
*  And you just got waylaid by one of the greatest heavyweights of all time and flattened
*  That was a crazy. You know I was watching about the
*  He was so fun to watch because he annoyed so many people because he was so cocky
*  And he had such a weird style as that that Prince not see oh my god is that guy fun to watch?
*  Oh, he was amazing. You know Tyson had syphilis and that or not something like that in that fight
*  No, that was Buster Douglas did he yeah, but the clap or something. I think it was this right. There was a fight he won
*  Yeah, the fight when he fought Buster Douglas. He just didn't train very hard for it. Just really was just dominating everybody and
*  Took it for granted and Buster he still almost won still drop Buster and to this day like if you watch that fight when Buster's down
*  It's more than 10 seconds. Yeah, but the thing was he didn't go to the corner fast enough. I thought
*  And he picked up the count. I thought he would have got up. I don't know I
*  Remember where I was when I watched that I remember all of that shit. I was at my buddy Mitch's house
*  We were upstairs
*  And he's on his fucking square TV
*  And I was like you know because you take a look at that
*  TV and I was like, you know, cuz you cheer for the underdog and he was all bummed out going
*  I want to see Mike lose and I was just like I didn't realize what I
*  Had lost as a sports fan cuz you're losing greatness
*  Not that he's not great, but you know what I mean? You wanted to see that undefeated right keep going thing
*  And then afterwards, you know, it's a weird thing but the Buster Douglas in that fight
*  You know the whole story behind it his mom died
*  Yeah
*  And he was devastated and so he was always a really really talented guy that just didn't work hard enough
*  But that fight he trained like a motherfucker. He trained like a real champion probably came out
*  Yeah, I didn't want to face didn't want to think about it. So probably just focused on it
*  It was that maybe also he was like doing it. He was dedicating it to his mom
*  But he once again the human element, but I just remove
*  I am I am is this what you're finding out from this the pandemic being locked up and having too much alone time
*  But I understand I understand my anger now, I don't know how to fix it, but I understand what is it? What is your anger?
*  It's feeling like I'm not gonna be heard and things are gonna go in a way
*  I don't want them to be so the second isn't there's a suggestion different than mine
*  I
*  Catastrophize in my head and I don't just go be like well, you know, actually I can't do that because I'm doing Joe's podcast
*  Maybe I could do that tomorrow. I just hear the information and feel like I have no power and then I go
*  What the fuck?
*  Then my wife's like I just asked a question and then I am so fucking up here
*  I have to like it takes it only takes me like two minutes and then I come in
*  I put my head to the side of her head and I just go I'm sorry. I don't tell you you married a fuck
*  You blew it you're not good you're not good at reading people
*  You have no one to blame but yourself like that. I apologize like an asshole
*  No, my
*  There's another thing too is I've I also in this have never loved my wife more
*  You know gave me a son and it's just like it's one of those things where
*  You know, you just said that's a beautiful really sit there going like I am really like I am way way more of a fucking asshole
*  Than I thought I was I knew I was but I didn't think I was that bad
*  So you realize you've got issues, but you don't know how to solve them. That's what it is. I
*  Realized that I had issues that I thought I was past. Hmm
*  That's what fucked me up. But see you feel like
*  Like alright, so I've taken care of that now I can focus on this and it's like no. No, this is still in this pile
*  You thought it was six feet high. It's 12 feet high and it was
*  Yeah, it was demoralizing so don't you think no one is part of the way to fix it though
*  Yeah, but then you have to go through the torture of it of
*  Because it's not like it's not like, you know, like the dr. Phil episode you need to understand
*  You know fucking yellow people whatever the fucking you go. Okay. Thanks Phil and like you're just gonna go do that
*  It's it's like nothing then you have to do the fucking work and it's so easy to just go back into your your yes
*  It's a deep groove worn into your personality and you're trying to get out of the rut and it's just easy to go back into it
*  And just be on autopilot
*  That's why people like psychedelics. That's why people like psychedelics because it separates you so much from who you are
*  You get a chance to look at yourself. It's one of the things that comes out of it
*  I should have done that when I was younger can't do it now like right now
*  On this podcast. I don't think I don't think a little bit of a professional. I'm supposed to be promoting one of these feature films
*  We've already done it. We've promoted it looks great. I'm excited. I'm excited to see you with a mustache. Oh
*  So you're saying I'm done in the neck now do this you do a little drugs
*  Just a little mushrooms be good for you. Listen Joe. I know you're an influencer, but you ain't gonna win on this one
*  Dirty word to me I will be

*  I love see I love Seattle. I'm a big fan
*  I used to love that Bellevue place the the pool hall that was a it was a pool hall
*  Connected to a comedy club. Remember that
*  Jimmy do that place didn't know did that one went under went under real recently
*  It was fucking great trying to remember the name of the place, but it was in Bellevue and
*  I first went there with Callum Callum was one and told me about I was like this is this is my dream a pool
*  Hall connected to a comedy club. This is a great thing. I've ever heard of
*  He's one of the fastest minds

*  There it is the parlor. Yeah permanently closed
*  Talented guy too. I saw him one time with a bow and arrow
*  Just talking all of this shit and somebody hit him
*  He had a bullseye and then he did the next one he split his fucking arrow talking shit the whole fuck
*  Yes, where'd you do this at this guy's house that had one of those things?
*  I was dead luck Brian is terrible archery. There's no jack shit about archery. Hey, listen, I know what I saw
*  We used dreaming no, I saw this he talked shit the whole time and he did it. It was fucking great
*  It was like I was watching a movie. I bought him a bow. Listen, I gotta tell you something
*  I think you need to move him a little bit higher up in your brain. He's one of my best friends
*  That's how you talk about a friend. I love him
*  But I bought him a bow a bottom of Hoyt carbon spider really nice bow never used it once
*  He was wait, I gotta use that bow. I gotta use that bow one day. I'm like
*  Get a fucking target. He's probably standing on the string doing curls knowing him. Maybe he boxes
*  I still go to the boxing gym likes to mix it up. He goes in there and spars. I'm like Brian
*  You're gonna get brain damage. You're 53 years old. He can't be getting punched in the face
*  Yeah, but he's like a Jason Statham 53
*  You cuz you got it you have to know that dude now that we're these old fucks
*  Okay, we're hanging in there cuz you see people I see at this point I remember that's when I first felt old
*  Was when I would meet people after shows and be like this guy's got at least five years on me and I find out they
*  Were five years younger than me like I'll be like 33
*  I'd be looking at your fucking 28 and he was like a real 28 married three kids and I saw what that looked like
*  You know
*  You know, you know this fucking business this business you get shit on like like I love the harassing to a point on
*  Social media harassing the you know, hey, you know, hey Billy boozeface
*  Say Billy fat tits and all that shit like that motivates me like I look you gotta honestly look at yourself like they're right
*  Yeah, they're hanging a little bit. I need I need to do some push-ups. They will fucking
*  Bully you into getting and shit. It's all how you process the information
*  No, yeah, there's nothing to that. Yeah, this is like you talking about fat shaming
*  I'm telling you that if I wasn't in this business, I would be a fat fuck. I get those blonde Oreo cookies
*  Root beer floats. I would be fucking hammering that shit
*  Yeah, cuz then on Twitter I would just have the fucking the pussy picture just the egg one
*  You know when nobody knows who you are and I could be a fat fuck being like, you know
*  Just giving people shit you go a little fatter since the last movie. I would have a blast doing that
*  How's your shoulder?
*  It's great. It's better because I've been I finally there was another thing is
*  this like the shoulder thing also caused me that I had to slow down and
*  like
*  The patience you need to rehab it. Mm-hmm
*  Like you're sitting there with like at first it's just the weight of your arm doing the crawls up the wall
*  Then you lay on your side then it's just the weight of your arm and then a tuna can
*  Then I went into a can of clams and now I'm up to the pink weight the one pounder and
*  Then this is the big this is the big tipping point when you go from one pound to two pound is
*  Ridiculous is that sound you're increasing the weight load by a hundred percent and that's when you get hurt
*  Because you want to get like I used to be able to do like 15 pound, you know 20 pound 25
*  They don't those those sets used to do. Yeah, and now I if I've you know, when it's really hurting I beach for some salt
*  I'm like it resets it
*  so what I do is I just get slowly work my way up to three sets of 20 and
*  Then when I go to two pounds when I do it, I'll just do three sets of three
*  So I'm way beneath the weight load that I did and then you gradually
*  It requires all of this patience that I don't fucking have what is wrong with it
*  This one I had a bursitis this one
*  I actually I fucked up something else and this one is totally fine now
*  But I'm not using it as much because I'm not using this one so I do the rehab on both sides just to keep them
*  Equal I've been doing a lot of core work a lot of back shit that I never did which is how my shoulder got fucked up
*  Because I just did the 80s things, you know this did everything up here
*  But what I could see I worked on so all back here was like we can't fucking hold this shit
*  So everything my my shoulders bowed in and one was higher than the other and then eventually it just got pinched
*  Yeah, I just do these fucking things. I know that's for this but I didn't do anything
*  For the middle of my back or lower back all of this shit. I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about
*  You ever use bands?
*  Yeah, bands are a good way to not get hurt. I'm a big fan. There's a
*  product called crossover symmetry and it's a series of different weight bands. I'll show it to you out here
*  I have it attached to one of the
*  bars one of the cages and these
*  These bands they come in 15 pounds
*  25 pounds 40 pounds bunch of different weights and you take these things and I do a whole series of exercises with my shoulders
*  It's great. It keeps everything strong and you're not really you know, you're not pushing it
*  Once I get weights. Yeah, I'd like to look at that. I'm not gonna do it
*  But once I get to a certain level of strength
*  But the things you can do it it's not gonna hurt you because you're not you're just doing it lightly
*  I got a lawsuit coming your way, buddy
*  I
*  Just thought of something I just forgot something that I learned about myself with that shit now come to me
*  As far as like with rehabilitation
*  Yeah, but it also came into my personality just something that I kind of oh, this is what I learned about myself
*  And why I didn't miss stand-up because it was freaking me out is because what I experienced as a kid
*  straight across the board
*  Made me go to this mental place
*  Like I don't care
*  Fuck it. I don't care. I don't need it. I don't give a shit and that caused that caused that's what caused everything to get walled off
*  And that actually feeds into
*  rehabbing
*  injuries because I was a big moment for me where I got this fucking
*  Console thing that I'm trying to put in my podcast studio and they're supposed to deliver it and bring it in there, right?
*  So the day they were gonna deliver it my wife went into labor
*  So I went to the hospital and then they showed up and I didn't want them going out my garage
*  I got all my memorabilia and shit. I just didn't want people in there unless I was there
*  So I said I just haven't drop it off
*  I thought it was gonna be a box and it was already assembled and it was fucking big, right?
*  And it was also the weight load of it. I
*  Was just I was like, ah fuck it if I keep my arms in like this
*  It's mostly biceps and I was gonna do this and I was gonna do this stupid German Irish
*  Fuck it. And what it was gonna do was gonna set me back
*  Once again, like I had a big setback in February. I had an acting gig and they said hey
*  It was just a stupid little action thing. It's a wall put your hands on it hop over. Can you do that?
*  I'm like, yeah, my shoulder feels pretty good in the second went like that
*  I felt like lightning go down my shoulder. I was like, ah fuck right back to the fucking tuna canning and all that shit
*  so I actually
*  Had a friend come over we were gonna do it I said, you know what dude I
*  I'll I
*  Owe you a fucking dinner or something
*  I'm not doing this and I called up this guy that I knew was a construction company
*  I go you got a couple of strong young guys that can just move this thing in there and
*  I just had them do it and and like and that's like something that I'm pushing through where
*  It helps me as a comic and also helps me deal with highly emotional shit because I can just shut shit off and just
*  Do what I have to do
*  Which works like back in the day when you're gonna do Letterman which was fucking terrifying
*  It's freezing cold and you just have to be like fuck this just it's just fucking people
*  This is just a different shiny floor that's freaking me out and there's an icon sitting at that desk
*  I I had the tools to shut that off, which is great for that moment, but it's terrible for the rest of your fucking life
*  Like this shit that's like I just realized there's this shit in me that I needed that I have not dealt with
*  Death of friends all of that shit is just sitting in here, and I think that's also
*  like when
*  People then go like hey, can you do this?
*  Oh, what the fuck like like it's not all just that I'm not gonna get what I want a lot of that is like
*  You got all of this shit that you're sitting on
*  So you're sitting on all that and you haven't addressed it
*  So then it just it the only way for the steam to come out is like for you to snap or whatever
*  So which is really not fair to the people around you
*  To be honest with you, so I don't know if you got a therapy
*  Yeah
*  Yeah, yeah, what about meditating you ever meditate? Yeah, but I find the guy's voice is fucking annoying
*  You don't have to listen shut up
*  Every time I'm getting there he starts fucking talking again, and then he's using this really
*  soothing caring voice
*  That makes me face all of that shit that I didn't get growing up which makes me angry at this person
*  That's trying to help me
*  Wow, yeah
*  Quarantining is not a bad thing if
*  From what it's worth you're always fun to hang around with I always enjoy your company
*  I don't have any issues with any of your crazy cuz I have a crushing need to be liked
*  So I tone down my cuntiness when I'm around you
*  Listen my wife knows me hang out with her one time. She'll tell you some fucking stories. I'm sure yeah
*  well
*  The you that I get I like if that helps you yeah, you know the deal
*  You don't know anybody till you live with them all right, you know I
*  Will not accept your compliments that's another part of my personality
*  Who's the guy that's running the meditation app that's annoying you do you know who's happy using I don't want to put the guy
*  On blast, but yeah, I do okay. Let me know and he's great
*  He's great. He's great. He's doing he's trying to help people I understand yeah
*  You should do it without an app do I got I have a story. I can't say I can't say what I said
*  Nowadays I can't say what I said, but I'm always playing pickup hockey and I suck right, but I'm having a good time out there
*  I'm just you know I'm out there trying to get a sweat going right
*  And you know I'm having my head down and we're playing no contact him because I had it was really my fault
*  I had my head down on this guy fucking knocked me down on the other team. He goes are you all right?
*  Yeah, what I said to that guy still fucking regret
*  I was so mad at him. Mm-hmm
*  I was so mad at him mm-hmm that he was caring in that moment
*  And that's one of those things it was like what is wrong with me
*  Wow
*  You're really trying to come to grips with all this shit right now
*  Yeah, because I don't want to pass this shit on to my kids. That's what happens. That's just like
*  Yeah, when people are like
*  If people say my kids are not like me like I'm like good
*  That's weird, but I do think that a lot if they'll oh, yeah, he's you know she's like you know happy go like my great
*  Like I forget what somebody said one time
*  About my daughter cuz she's like she's this angel right and they made some sort of
*  You know comic made the comment. You know thinking it was gonna hurt me, and I was like yeah, dude. That's fucking music to my ears
*  I don't want to I don't want to be like me
*  Don't
*  Do you think they were trying to hurt you when they said it?
*  No, it was one of those comic things where they don't have kids so and it was a guys and they don't know what to say
*  So then they got to like make a fucking
*  joke
*  Like I had a buddy mine a comedian on my birthday. He goes hey happy destroying your mother's uterus day
*  And I just remember laughing going like oh
*  There's a guy has to do a little more work than I have to or I can say I can say I know but I mean
*  I know what it is it was a Boston comic, and he couldn't just say happy birthday
*  Because that would be gay
*  so he has to
*  Go so so over correct that has to go to that level. It's so fucking stupid
*  It's probably why guys die before women you hang on to shit, and there's all that stuff. You know
*  Can't say enjoy sunset Joe you can't do that
*  Why can't you
*  Shut up, but I know why I know you do
*  I know but the thing about you is you can also beat the shit out of most people in a fucking room
*  So you got that so people can be like oh wow you know they actually want to hear that from you
*  When they see you spinning heel kick they want to know that you enjoy a sunset cuz like I don't want if this guy's
*  As angry as I am and can do all of that shit
*  What are my odds of getting out of here, so you want to see that out of a guy like you?
*  Big guy like you don't want to see it don't want to see you enjoying a sunset Joe. I don't read. I don't
*  I don't know what it is. I
*  Am I am too in here to understand me?
*  This is interesting. I have a very I have a very weird thing
*  I have an alley of my personality that works that I somehow turned into a living yeah, but the rest of it
*  Looks like Fred Sanford's yard
*  Old radiators and bed frames and shit, it's a fucking mess
*  It's interesting because I've never seen you this introspective where you're really trying to work it out
*  You're really thinking about it more than I've ever seen you think about it before you've always joked around about it
*  You know and all the years I've known you it's always been a part of the things you talk about but it seems
*  Much more at the forefront of your consciousness right now like something you really need to work on
*  Yeah, I think it started last year doing the movie. Oh he brings back at the movie
*  It was there was a bunch of shit that I had to play
*  That I never had to play before you want me to be a loud fucking asshole. I can do that
*  but then all of a sudden like I
*  Had a lot of anxiety about a lot of the stuff like my character had two kids
*  And I was like I'm gonna do this. I'm gonna do this. I'm gonna do this
*  I'm gonna do this. I'm gonna do this
*  I had a lot of anxiety about a lot of the stuff like my character had two kids and like the first time I meet
*  The kids it's classic acting where it's just like you just show up. I remember I took this acting class
*  This guy Brendan Hughes. He was great. He was saying like he was talking about what it's like to go in a movie set
*  It's us like how you have to have access to all these emotions because you're showing up and it's just like okay
*  You're this guy and this is your dad and your mother just died and action and it's just like what because that's
*  The way it goes. It just goes real quick. So yeah, so I have to play like this
*  So I got two kids here. So the first day I met them
*  We had to do the family photo. They wanted to have one of those things in the background for a scene
*  so you have to and I'm sitting there going like
*  Fuck, you know, I gotta I gotta act like I love these kids the way I love my kids
*  Like and that was really confronting for me as far as how I'm wide. Well, fuck you. I don't need anybody so
*  I had like a fucking panic attack before like real even that thing like just being like
*  Just that comic thing where you're just like dude, I just I stand on stage
*  I do shit jokes for a fucking hour you give the check and then I fucking leave I
*  Smoked a cigar. It's fucking leave me alone, right and this thing here. It's like no you you're now in a schedule
*  Somebody tells you where you have to be so like, you know
*  I was like a cat on a leash all of a sudden like yeah
*  I have to be all these places. I was freaking out about that and then the the I
*  Had to do the picture with the kids. So what I did was I
*  Just I got myself into a really silly mood and I was deliberately I was joking with all the other actors
*  I was making fun of myself. I was joking with anybody that anything to do with the movie
*  I got this really silly stupid move and I just
*  To get myself in that headspace and then I met them I started joking around
*  About what I look like and this is what your dad looked like and then they started laughing
*  So when they took the picture we were actually laughing about a joke
*  I was making about myself and then I looked at the pictures and they they looked they looked real
*  They look like I love these kids
*  So I got over that hurdle. So like throughout the shoot, you know, obviously the shit yelling at Pete
*  It's like I can fucking do that all day
*  But all that other stuff and it's like okay and you know, Jeb would be like, okay, and then you meet Margie and
*  You're smitten and it's like smitten
*  You know, I've never had I've been smitten in life, but I've never you know as a comedian
*  I don't think you ever really go on stage
*  And if you were to do something where you were smitten you're making fun of that emotion and the stupid things that you do
*  It's like no we need you to play this real
*  Like you really have just and I'm like, oh, so I'm like into her he goes
*  No, I'm your love struck like a lightning bolt and I'm just like
*  And so I don't she's like I don't know how to fucking do this and you know fucking you know
*  I'm in my head. I'm in my head
*  This person's won an Oscar thing. I think I suck, you know, just going through all of that shit. So it took me probably
*  Two weeks on the film I
*  Was two weeks in they had shot enough of my shit where I was like, alright, they're not gonna fire me. I
*  Can kind of relax a little and then after that I had I had a I did I had a great time
*  I had a fucking great time best time I've had on
*  Any acting gigs and I've had a lot of fun throughout the year
*  so I think that's what sort of started it and I was kind of like
*  You know trying to
*  Communicate it to my wife and she doesn't know what I'm talking about. She's like you're doing a movie
*  This is fucking great. She has access, you know opposite to tracks. She has access to all of that shit
*  She's actually, you know a fucking way better actor than I am and stuff. So I she helps me out a lot
*  So after those two weeks, I was able to chill and then I had a great time and I got over a bunch of hurdles
*  And I was kind of oh, this is like
*  Growing as a comic where it's like, okay. I I know how to do this as a comic
*  What if I try to act something out? Oh, that's not my safe space now
*  I start feeling like an open mic or again, they're not gonna like me and like stuck in spots at the store
*  Go home live home with my parents. I start doing that shit. Yeah
*  The whole show going on up here job. Did you watch it after it was done?
*  Yeah, I watched the initial cut of it and
*  Then I saw the final version of it and everything and you enjoy it
*  Yeah, it's one of those things. You're just to you
*  you know everything that was there and wasn't there and like and like especially with jokes like
*  There was there was some
*  You know, there's always gonna be stuff that you are. God. I wish why did they cut there?
*  I wish they put this in but like it's as far as like the movie itself
*  I loved it how it worked and the way they put it together and there's the opening scene
*  That's in the movie initially was in the middle of the movie and somebody Judd
*  I don't know who came up with the brilliant idea to put that scene first and it totally changed the tone of
*  the movie and it then that's when it like took off because I saw a real raw cut and it was like
*  This is a bunch of funny shit and like everybody I've ever talked to edits a movie
*  Like when they watch their first cut in the movie, they're like, oh my god
*  I'm never gonna I'm never gonna work in this business again. I just wasted my fucking
*  You know, I was actually talking to one of the actors who had directed one of my favorite movies trees lounge
*  Steve Buscemi made that movie and he told us how this fucking hilarious story about
*  The way, you know when he the first cut that he watched of it like he just like went home like a zombie
*  You know like going oh my god, like how am I gonna make and it's such a great movie by the time he was done
*  editing it but his first like
*  Look at it. So that helped me out a guy as good as him having that type of thought
*  I was just like, oh jeez. I think that shit all the time
*  You know, this guy's an icon if he thinks that then this is normal
*  So like I guess I'm kind of normal to think this shit
*  So yeah, so they I think that started it and then I just kind of would have just been happy to get through the movie and
*  Then that would have been it and then I had to be quarantined
*  Oh, we all got come with him something like myself typical self-involved me everybody's quarantined
*  and then that just became me sitting around and I was like, I'm not watching TV because this is just gonna
*  Fuck it make me feel like
*  Claustrophobic watching all this news and shit trying to be informed
*  So I kind of went away from that and then I was just in the house with me just sitting there and everybody was asleep
*  It's fucking just thinking thinking but not in a bad way. I don't think I don't know
*  Well, it doesn't seem like it's a bad way it seems like you've isolated some of the things that you
*  You have a problem with that you need to work out
*  Yeah, I mean that's uh, that's one
*  Great leap on the way to figuring it out is knowing what you're trying to work on
*  Some people go though their whole life not understanding what the fuck is wrong. I'm jealous of those people
*  I grew up a lot of those people those people watch TV all the time. No, they just they are who they are and
*  They just fucking do that there is something I know that I have actually
*  So fucked up this people like when I look at people
*  That just do whatever the fuck they want to do
*  You know like who doesn't want to just fucking eat a large cheese pizza and then finish it off with the pine ice cream
*  Like those people that do that. I know they pay for it, but there is something to be I'm reading this book right now on
*  Bobby Lane was a quarterback
*  For the Detroit Lions and there's all these legend that his story is so legendary
*  you don't even know where the the the the legend isn't where the truth is but like
*  this guy art Dunn of and used to tell a story about
*  you know, he was on the other team and he sacked him and
*  You know, he's getting up and Bobby breathed on he goes Jesus Christ, man
*  Where the fuck did you go last night and Bobby allegedly said last night? He goes I had a couple of pops at halftime
*  You know, these guys were fucking lunatics and he lived this life where he had this wide array of friends
*  Really progressive where he he like, you know through playing sports he had
*  African-american friends and if they were to go into some place and they said your friend can't come in he goes
*  No, we're not fucking going in. I mean this guy was doing this in the 50s and 60s, right and
*  He was always like that and but he died at like 58 or 59 and it was hard for all of his friends to see him
*  you know not being like the legend, but there's a great part in the book where he's talking about his life and
*  Like knowing that you know
*  He probably should have gone easier
*  But like this big smile came on his face that he kind of did it the way he wanted to
*  Because believe me dude, I would love to go home and kill a bottle of bourbon right now
*  I would love to smoke another fucking
*  Five of these fucking things, but I got too many people dependent on me
*  but there is something to be said about living, you know, those people they just
*  Like I like booze. I like it. I like getting drunk and and just if I want to do it every night
*  I'm fucking gonna do it. I live at home. I want to get a pizza
*  I'm gonna have a fucking pizza you do pay for but there is I made me think of like well, let me from motorhead
*  Well, what's yeah, what's that life like? Yeah as opposed to being like well, you know
*  I gotta make sure I eat my Brussels sprouts and I flick and you kind of
*  inch your way to death as
*  Opposed to just being like fuck it
*  Pizza tastes good. I want a pizza fuck it. I'm having one
*  Let's try every bourbon that guy like I love that in the lemmy doc
*  When he just had all those
*  Suburban the greatest thing the lemmy thing is when those guys were saying let me goes
*  Hey, you want you want some Jack Daniels?
*  They go
*  Yeah
*  And he takes a bottle down and then hands both of them their own bottle and they were like what the fuck and he starts
*  Drinking out of this like he's having a coke
*  I
*  Said something fucking hilarious, but when he watched the lemmy doc
*  He goes dude if I saw that thing when I was in my 20s and I knew Lemmy was gonna live to be 70
*  He goes I never would have stopped
*  His last days were rough though, I remember I think everybody's last days are rough unless you drop dead
*  But his last days on performing. I mean he basically performed until the wheels fell off
*  There's a video of him like one of the last shows that he did where he had a walk-off stage the middle of his performance
*  He was such a fucking badass even like just the way he had the microphone the way he would sing
*  We just can't be in the fucking bass was all low. Yeah, can't teach that man. That kid was fucking in his DNA
*  well, he lived it that's for sure and he is a legend and
*  There's something to be said for that. There's it's all what you put your energy to
*  Yeah, it's kind of how you like I you notice it's the balls to live that life indulgent and wild
*  Yeah, we're like this. There's all this heroism to sobriety
*  But I which there is yeah being sober and just taking life in the face every day is
*  Is fucking hard and I think
*  To see somebody but that has the balls even with all the surgeon general shit as I'm sitting here smoking a fucking cigar
*  Looking for a toothpick if you have one
*  No, no toothpick who's got to that piece of stick right there you can turn that into a fucking stick in in here
*  This is why I just stopped cigars because I'll smoke it right down on my fucking fingers
*  Yeah, whittle that thing down
*  Jesus Christ Joe give me that stick. Oh, is that the way you supposed to hand somebody a knife?
*  Well, I was gonna oh you were gonna do it. Yeah, I don't need you Joe. I don't need anybody. Good luck
*  You need a roach clip
*  You want another cigar so you don't have to do that?
*  Mean we have now this is the best part. That's the best part of cigar. Yes, mostly get the smoke goes right to you. Yeah
*  Yeah, okay
*  Feel like I'm in therapy. Listen, I'm a therapist right now. Listen, don't switch to kidglove tone with me. All right
*  I'm just fucking around here. I'm sorry bill. See that just
*  Just trying to assess the situation
*  Oh, are you is that what your training has taught you you talked all these whack jobs on your fucking podcast
*  The let me thing is you know, that's one of the things that people love about them, right because
*  Everybody knows you're supposed to eat. Well, everybody knows you're not supposed to get fucked up every night. Everybody knows you're supposed to be
*  responsible and mature and
*  and
*  Smart but we do just want work
*  Didn't work. No, no, it's gonna be slip. Look at them there
*  He was just wild wild to the end
*  And yeah, and I think you need you need people like that
*  You do you do because you can get a lot out of the way that they live where everyone's so I can be like
*  You know, fuck this. Let's go. Let's be Lemmy today
*  Yeah, you get you get great art out of those people too
*  those wild people the Bukowski's and Sam Kinnison's and the Lemmy's and
*  The people that just fucking go hard there's something to that. Yeah, there's something to that too
*  Yeah, and there's also something to people that are stoic, you know, what's interesting to me is the just
*  the range of people I
*  Can get I can get things out of people that just drink water and meditate and I'm fascinated by them
*  I'm fascinated by people like I was watching some
*  Do you know Russell Simmons he lives in like where does he live in like
*  Bali or Indonesia or something like that. He was doing a an Instagram live
*  And he's doing it
*  cross-legged with like
*  Some crazy yoga shawl over his knees and shit in like it looked like an ashram and he's like he's basically talking
*  Like a yogi in an awesome. This guy was the head of Def Jam
*  Yeah, and he got like really really into yoga and now he lives in some
*  Country somewhere and just fucking does yoga
*  Was doing Instagram live talking to people like like like a guru
*  Yeah, I ain't gonna go that hard
*  I'm not either. I'll do
*  I'll do a yo, I mean I kind of do my own version of yoga just shit that I've learned
*  Do you do a little yoga I stretch all the time yeah, I have to cuz I
*  You know you just get to a certain age if you don't I mean, you know, yeah
*  Yeah, you kind of got to do all of that shit. So anyway
*  Enough of that you ever take a yoga class. Yeah, like hot yoga you ever do that
*  I am almost I just felt like I couldn't breathe. Yeah, and I remember to also like my back was fucked up
*  That's why I went to the class and the put like the position she started out with the twisting was happening too quickly
*  So I kind of just went down to the mat and I was doing all the thing and the teacher got like all freaked out
*  By it. Really? She's like, come on, you know, try to stay with the class
*  You can't be like busting out all these different awesome
*  And I just started fucking laughing where I was just thinking like this is all supposed to be about listening to your body
*  And you're literally you're like the oil man in here trying to control
*  This is your own little fucking economy and just the fact that I fuck you're walking around like you got it all figured out
*  You got 99% of people here all doing what the fuck you say and one guy
*  Goes down to his mat because his back is fucked up and you process it like I'm fucking with your authority in a yoga class
*  mmm, so
*  with my broad brush I said fuck hot yoga
*  That's
*  Hilarious yeah yoga teachers like everything else, you know
*  Some of them you're gonna enjoy some of them are gonna be really good at it
*  And some of them are gonna annoy the fuck out of you
*  What annoys the fuck out of me is when they start giving you motivational advice and telling you how to live your life
*  You've got to learn to let go of things like for me and then tell some personal story
*  And so yeah what I got out of that like Jesus Christ, can we fucking move on here?
*  I didn't come here to hear your first grade. I used to go to this one tree psychology. It was a great class
*  It was a great class, but the dude he had it was fucking awesome
*  I like I was after a while I would go I was just psychologically breaking this guy down
*  and
*  Something happened to him at a Gold's gym. I don't know what happened to him at him. He just was forever
*  making fun of muscle heads
*  and I was thinking you know, cuz I've
*  Had the hybrid thing going on like I love you know back before I fucked up my shoulder
*  I loved lifting weights. I loved going to the gym and all that shit and I liked the energy in a gym
*  you know, I liked it and
*  The old-school ones right when the guys used to walk around with the towels tucked into their fucking, you know that shit
*  and he was forever shitting on it and
*  then another thing that he would do with he would
*  Also somehow steer it toward like a subtle comment about lovemaking in the way too and he was putting out like
*  His vibe that he was good in bed
*  at the same time
*  That's a yoga guy move oh
*  You know and he had the little ponytail and shit it was fucking no it was like a Will Ferrell character
*  It was fucking funny. It's like this is like
*  It's like this is like it was like a real-life like Will Ferrell like
*  Like just really just like I know everything kind of vibe it was he wasn't as bad as that but it was just
*  It was funny though and I used to sit there
*  Yeah, this is like this dude in New York. I remember was fucking hilarious and it what was hilarious was I was bad at yoga
*  If there's that you're not supposed to even say that if you're doing it man
*  You just you know wherever your body's at is where you supposed to be right
*  And I just remember when he would walk around the class and he would adjust people
*  He'd always skip me and then adjust some hot chick who was way more flexible than me
*  And it's just like really I'm doing it right as I'm sitting over here for some reason
*  I never needed an adjustment of course and it was this was like the 90s so you could get away with this shit
*  There was a lot of adjusting like this almost cupping a titty and fucking like yeah shit on the hips and stuff. Yeah
*  Hey, God bless him. It's like a pied piper
*  You got all these hot chicks in there and you get them all stretched out before he banged him and it worked
*  so I couldn't hate on him for that, but it was I
*  To get through the class because I have such fucking ADD. I was just
*  There was like a comedy show going on within it like you know like house and then I like a couple buddies
*  I thought you gotta go you know we'll do it. You know like a bet when he's gonna shit
*  How many times he's gonna shit on the gym?
*  What does he say?
*  What would he say he would talk about
*  he would talk about the muscle heads coming in there and they had no flexibility and you know and how
*  Everything was all like overdeveloped, but you know he we'd always been doing some fucked up
*  Pose or something and he goes this works on your psoas
*  Like what machine in the gym?
*  You know is there a psoas machine?
*  You know I can't I was like fucking it was a long time ago and
*  At first it pissed me off. It's just like well. I like fucking doing curls
*  And then it just became funny to me
*  This is a specific type of guy that's like that I went to a yoga guy once used to singing classes
*  He wound up like he want a bang in this lady that was there
*  Back in the day you can't do it there was a lot of bangin back then a lot of this is like
*  I guess this is late 90s early 2000s maybe and he would sing in class and it was so
*  Cheap it was so disingenuous
*  Oh, yeah, like you would do these like yoga songs. I'm like you are so gross
*  There was but there was some really
*  Good ones that I found I found out you know some yeah, this is really good ones
*  This is really this guy go to I mean you hear him talk you think he's gonna be annoying
*  He's got pierced nipples the whole deal, but he's really sincere. He's really into it. He's so gay
*  He's so gay. It's like oozing when he talks
*  But you know he says so okay
*  Wait, so gay like the way he talks. We're here. We're here
*  You're supposed to be here. Let it go and but that's who he is like he's comfortable
*  He's well that's the last class well. That's the thing is if is if it's genuine. Yeah, yeah, then it becomes this great thing
*  Yeah
*  That's who he is he's uh
*  Yeah, it's it's like whoever the fuck you are if that's who you are like I like it
*  I don't I don't want you to try to sell me and who you are like the guy with the love me
*  It goes the last two hours of this podcast
*  The selling you on who they are is where it gets really gross pretending to be something they're not
*  Not be I mean I like flaws. It's good. We all have them you know so my favorite people are all flawed I
*  Don't mind. Yeah, and it's not even that guy was flawed. He was just
*  he was just
*  Like normally you would think if a guy was talking like that teaching yoga class like this is not gonna be fun
*  But it was great. Yeah, there's a lot of people that are really good at it man
*  It's just finding them you know so I like the place that I go to I just look at the schedule
*  I'm like oh, that's a good one. I'll take her class. I like him. He's fun
*  Yeah, and this is one dude. He has weird tattoos like real strange like it always has to be clean, too
*  Cuz there's so much sweating going on I hate when you go like those hot yoga classes
*  There's just no way to get this the floors were sweating like there's just no way to he's got to accept it
*  It's so good for your body
*  So good for your stretching too because you can get into positions when you're doing hot yoga
*  That you're not gonna get into and it's like really stretching that tissue out and extending your range of motion. I love it
*  I'm a fucking evangelist for it though
*  I tell so many people to do it a lot of people have listened
*  But more people just get annoyed well. I love that when you guys do the sober October mm-hmm
*  You know when I watch sagura and fucking
*  Chrysler dry out and like three weeks in they start looking like movie stars and shit
*  Well when we did the fitness one we did one sober October fitness challenge we were all wore these
*  These straps and we had to like compete to see who can get the most fitness points and stuff like that
*  Ari got a fucking six-pack like Ari got shredded
*  Like he doesn't even work out he like before that he was never working out and over the course of the month by the end
*  Of the month he had a legit six-pack and he looked great. He was he's always pretty wiry though. Yeah, he done thin
*  Yeah, he got fat at one point in time because he was eating nothing but candy. He was literally eating candy all day long
*  He was always he was only a bag of gummy bears with him and shit like that
*  But then I got a place still the message when we're done with this I got to play the message him congratulate me
*  Having a kid. It's so arty. It's so fucking funny
*  But yeah, he he dried out with that and then
*  Didn't he never gained it back, but he never never had that six-pack again. He was shredded because he was super competitive
*  He was really trying to win. It was really interesting. It's interesting to watch
*  I and I liked how Burt would do it too where Burt would have like he would always have like a
*  crazy buildup
*  That was totally against
*  What he told me this story?
*  About him running the fucking LA marathon and like drinking the night before it's just like dude you could have fucking died
*  And he never really trained for it, but he but he just but he he's mentally strong
*  He just got himself from this mindset of put one foot in front of the other and I am NOT stopping
*  Until I get to the finish line
*  26 miles fuck fucking hell of a haul for a fat guy
*  He did it. Yeah
*  You won't catch me doing that. No, no marathon running. No, it was on it all
*  No, I was now I used to ride a bike I did that for a while where I
*  I got so into it. I'm one time
*  I actually was drinking in the afternoon and I still had to go on a bike ride. I got on a bike shit face
*  It was sweating
*  This is the 80s to no helmet no nothing and just fucking rode like
*  like 12 miles and
*  I never had heard the expression. I never felt hitting a wall
*  Like whatever the electrolytes there was just nothing left and I was like six miles
*  This East Coast. There's all kinds of hills and shit from my house. And I was like I
*  Don't think I don't what am I gonna do? There was no cell phones
*  Like what am I gonna do?
*  So I just kept riding and then it was like this five minute like I'm gonna die
*  I'm not gonna get through this and then I just got to the other side with a I think my body was just like
*  All right, there must be something
*  Like death must be chasing us. So we need to go into something else here and I pushed through into that
*  That's what they say happens when you do those ultra marathons those people they get to a point where they think there's no way they can
*  Keep going they're doing a hundred miles and they're 38 miles in and they're ready to quit
*  But they just managed to just keep left right left, right left, right
*  And eventually you get into a zone and you're you cross the finish line
*  20 hours later. Hey, god bless him. Now that's that I would just say well that you have all the people handing you cups of shit
*  And you can just tap out. These a lot of things you have to do and those those 24-hour races you have to eat
*  Like you run dry. It's not like a regular marathon
*  Yeah, no, I'm not yeah those triathlons bill burr has been a great therapy session. Thank you
*  Season four coming out tomorrow how you have time to do that
*  How the fuck do you have time to do efforts for family as well as stand up as well as all the other shit you do?
*  drums delegation
*  You you you surround yourself with super talented people you do your job. They do their job and you're able to
*  You're able to do that able to do it, but I I needed this break though. I'm not gonna lie to you
*  I needed it too. I didn't think I needed it. I thought it was fine
*  But now I am like fucking chomping at the bit to get back on stage
*  I can't wait and I yeah
*  I miss hearing people laughing and hanging with comics and hearing the crazy shit. They say next time I see I hope it's at the store
*  Yes, or the troubadour the troubadour either one either or I'm in all right, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you so much. Bye brother. All right
