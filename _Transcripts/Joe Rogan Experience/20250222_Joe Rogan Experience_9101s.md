# Joe Rogan Experience #2277 - Woody Harrelson
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [February 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6.0s)]
*  So what's happening man? How are you? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=10.0s)]
*  Everything's groovy as could be. I'm happy to be in Austin. I love it here, you know. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=15.0s)]
*  It's a fun place. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=20.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. I mean I stay here. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=21.0s)]
*  Oh do you? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=24.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. And I don't know, it's like just a special place in this country. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=25.0s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. It's perfect because it's like a blue city and a red state. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=33.0s)]
*  It's like even the really kooky liberal people are pretty reasonable in comparison to like kooky liberal people from California or New York. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=37.0s)]
*  Yeah, kooky liberals. Yeah, I've been thinking a lot about that lately. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=47.0s)]
*  Did you get a lot of that after Saturday Night Live? A lot of kooky liberals coming your way? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=52.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a good transition. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=57.0s)]
*  That monologue was great by the way. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=61.0s)]
*  Yeah, well I got a lot of blowback as I knew I would. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=64.0s)]
*  Because you told the truth. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=70.0s)]
*  Well yeah, you know, it's just that you don't want to say anything negative about vaccines, which I didn't. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=73.0s)]
*  What I was talking about in that monologue was really about profiteering. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=81.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=88.0s)]
*  Okay, so World War II, necessary. Everyone could say that was a necessary war. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=89.0s)]
*  Let's say that this war on microbes was a necessary war, right? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=94.0s)]
*  Why is anyone profiteering? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=100.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=103.0s)]
*  Why did, you know, FISA get to make $100 billion in 2021? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=104.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=111.0s)]
*  Anyway. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=112.0s)]
*  Why did the government profit off of it? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=113.0s)]
*  The profiteering of war is just wrong. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=116.0s)]
*  Like okay, if you say that it has to be, there's conflicts happening right now I disagree with. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=119.0s)]
*  But I'm wondering why are people making money off of it? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=126.0s)]
*  Even if you think you have a legitimate vantage point from the other side of it, why did someone get to make so much freaking money off of it? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=130.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. It's the dirtiest aspect of human beings. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=140.0s)]
*  We'll find a way to profiteer off everything. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=145.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=148.0s)]
*  Everything and anything, even if it's just and they'll prolong just things in order to make more profit. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=149.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, I'm sure you know that, you know, Richard Nixon knew it was imperative that the war continue. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=156.0s)]
*  You know, the Vietnam War back before he got elected, you know. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=165.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=169.0s)]
*  He didn't want that to get settled. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=170.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=172.0s)]
*  And there's a great phone call. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=173.0s)]
*  I don't know if you've listened to any of Johnson's phone calls. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=175.0s)]
*  Lyndon Johnson. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=180.0s)]
*  What phone call? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=181.0s)]
*  There was a phone call he had with Nixon saying, hey man, you're going against the peace because he was trying to get a peace to go before the 68 election, right? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=182.0s)]
*  Which he eventually just bailed out of anyway because he could see he was going to lose it. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=197.0s)]
*  Johnson. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=202.0s)]
*  Any I don't you know, maybe you haven't. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=203.0s)]
*  No, I've never heard that conversation between Nixon. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=206.0s)]
*  It's an incredible conversation. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=209.0s)]
*  And Nixon's like, oh, I wouldn't have wouldn't do that. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=211.0s)]
*  I would never, you know. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=213.0s)]
*  And of course, he was doing that. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=215.0s)]
*  He was subverting the peace process, you know, in the same way that, you know, they want to make sure Carter didn't get those, you know, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=217.0s)]
*  those guys released in Iran. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=226.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=231.0s)]
*  I was wondered about the Vietnam War. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=232.0s)]
*  How much of it was about heroin? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=234.0s)]
*  Three days before the 1968 presidential election, President Johnson contacted Senate Majority Leader Everett M. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=238.0s)]
*  Dirksen to inform him the White House had received hard evidence from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=245.0s)]
*  The campaign of Republican presidential candidate Richard M. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=251.0s)]
*  Dick Nixon was interfering with Johnson's effort to start peace talks to end the Vietnam War. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=254.0s)]
*  And this called Johnson referred to contacts between Nixon's campaign and South Vietnamese president when Van Thea, I don't know how to say his name, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=259.0s)]
*  urged that they thwart any such negotiations. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=267.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=271.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=272.0s)]
*  And that did happen. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=273.0s)]
*  And also, they definitely Bush, you know, the senior Bush, George Bush, senior, he met in with the leaders of the Iranian, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=275.0s)]
*  why don't we call it a party, whatever, in before the election, the Carter, but the the fight between Carter and Reagan [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=291.0s)]
*  and insisted they needed to not be letting those hostages go. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=302.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=308.0s)]
*  And so I met Carter in Austin or rather in Atlanta. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=309.0s)]
*  I don't know, a couple, three years ago. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=315.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=317.0s)]
*  It's very exciting for me because I've I've always been a big, big fan of Carter. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=318.0s)]
*  I think he's the best president in my lifetime. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=322.0s)]
*  And I talked to Carter and he was like, and I said, I'm sitting there, I'm thinking to myself, is there a better time to ask? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=326.0s)]
*  When am I going to have another time? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=333.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=335.0s)]
*  And so that was known as the October surprise. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=336.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=338.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=339.0s)]
*  That that Bush met with those guys. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=340.0s)]
*  Anyway, I just said, I'm going to ask him, I said, well, I just wonder, is there any truth to the October surprise? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=343.0s)]
*  And he kind of he looks at me like he hadn't heard this question lately. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=353.0s)]
*  And he looks at it and he goes, well, I never talked about this publicly. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=358.0s)]
*  But we did still have people in the in the White House after we left who were there during the Reagan administration. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=363.0s)]
*  And they confirmed it was true. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=371.0s)]
*  Yeah, of course it was true. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=375.0s)]
*  It was too obvious. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=377.0s)]
*  The hostages get released right after Reagan gets elected. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=378.0s)]
*  They released them on the day he took office. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=381.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=383.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=384.0s)]
*  Ridiculous. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=385.0s)]
*  It's kind of disgusting. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=386.0s)]
*  Very disgusting. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=388.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=389.0s)]
*  But I mean, I don't want to be one to talk ill of the American government. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=390.0s)]
*  Far be it for me. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=400.0s)]
*  Yeah, we don't need to. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=401.0s)]

*  Like, it's exciting. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=477.0s)]
*  And I hardly ever go to the movies anymore. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=478.0s)]
*  But your people made me go see it in the movie theater. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=480.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=483.0s)]
*  So I actually go to a theater and see it. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=484.0s)]
*  It was great, though. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=486.0s)]
*  Well, thanks for doing that. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=487.0s)]
*  Oh, my pleasure. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=489.0s)]
*  I know you're a busy man. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=490.0s)]
*  You got a lot going on. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=493.0s)]
*  Yeah, I was excited to talk to you, man. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=494.0s)]
*  I'm a big fan. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=496.0s)]
*  I've been goddamn I've been watching you since Cheers. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=497.0s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=500.0s)]
*  It's a long time. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=501.0s)]
*  Well, I'm a fan of yours, too. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=502.0s)]
*  I really am. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=505.0s)]
*  I'm so I love the things you've done that just flipped everything on its head. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=506.0s)]
*  You know, the people you've interviewed that you got, you know, people generally genuinely [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=513.0s)]
*  up in arms, you know, like you're not afraid. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=519.0s)]
*  You're a fearless warrior. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=522.0s)]
*  And I just I appreciate what you do. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=524.0s)]
*  I get allowing voice to people. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=527.0s)]
*  Other people would be like, you're wrong just to interview that person. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=530.0s)]
*  Yeah, you get a lot of that for sure. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=535.0s)]
*  But that's ridiculous. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=537.0s)]
*  That's ridiculous. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=538.0s)]
*  That's ridiculous thinking. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=539.0s)]
*  I don't even understand that. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=541.0s)]
*  I really don't. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=543.0s)]
*  I don't understand how we got to a place where you're wrong to have a conversation with someone, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=544.0s)]
*  even if you disagree with them. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=549.0s)]
*  This idea of platforming people. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=550.0s)]
*  Well, how the fuck do you know what they really think based on what the mainstream media that [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=551.0s)]
*  lies to you constantly that's supported by all sorts of special interest groups that have [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=555.0s)]
*  no need to tell the American public the truth. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=561.0s)]
*  They have a very specific narrative that they want pushed. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=564.0s)]
*  They want no deviation from that at all. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=567.0s)]
*  The fuck out of here. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=569.0s)]
*  Look out of here. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=571.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=573.0s)]
*  And if you have a large audience, I think you have at least a certain amount of responsibility [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=574.0s)]
*  to talk to some people that you think might be telling the truth. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=579.0s)]
*  Yeah, I liked your interview with Robert Malone. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=582.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=586.0s)]
*  That was a crucial interview at a crucial time. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=587.0s)]
*  Well, that was the most pushback I'd ever experienced ever in my life. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=589.0s)]
*  And I was like, this is crazy. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=592.0s)]
*  When you it was really sad to see people like Joni Mitchell and Neil Young and like you got I wanted to sit down [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=594.0s)]
*  and talk to them and like show them some studies and give them Robert Kennedy's book and say like you don't [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=603.0s)]
*  really know what you're talking about. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=608.0s)]
*  Well, that's the thing that makes me sad is a lot of this information they're receiving is like from [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=610.0s)]
*  mainstream media, which certainly has its own objectives and its own, you know, things that it won't [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=616.0s)]
*  discuss. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=625.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=626.0s)]
*  Yeah, at all. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=627.0s)]
*  And and yeah, and I just felt like after that happened, you know, I almost was going to try to get in touch [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=628.0s)]
*  with you just to tip my hat to you. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=637.0s)]
*  But it just felt like why don't people just listen to the interview? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=639.0s)]
*  Because I feel like everyone who is giving it a hard time hadn't even heard the interview. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=644.0s)]
*  Of course. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=649.0s)]
*  Yeah, they had heard the mainstream media saying that it was dangerous misinformation. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=650.0s)]
*  By the way, everything he said has turned out to be true. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=654.0s)]
*  Every single thing he said had turned out to be true. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=657.0s)]
*  Everything that everybody said about whether it was a lab leak, whether the vaccine had side effects, whether it was [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=661.0s)]
*  pushed, whether they lied about the studies and distorted the information. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=666.0s)]
*  Everything was true. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=671.0s)]
*  All of it, including Yale just released some study about people producing spike protein 700 plus days after the [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=673.0s)]
*  injections, which is never thought to be the case when they gave them to these people in the first place. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=683.0s)]
*  A host of different serious problems that people are having because these that everyone's covering up and people [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=688.0s)]
*  are lying about and everyone's trying to obfuscate and doctors are trying to sweep things under the rug because [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=694.0s)]
*  they don't want to be in trouble for mandating these things and telling people to get these things. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=699.0s)]
*  It's horrible. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=703.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, I agree with you. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=706.0s)]
*  And yeah, if we go back to the allowing, you know, I just feel like to mandate was crazy. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=709.0s)]
*  You're just that's that to me is fascistic behavior. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=720.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=724.0s)]
*  If you mandate that I have to take this thing, that if you take it, you're protected. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=725.0s)]
*  Well, if I take it, wouldn't that might be my prerogative. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=731.0s)]
*  I either want to be protected or don't want to be protected. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=737.0s)]
*  Or maybe I am like I am, which is the last two entities on Earth. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=740.0s)]
*  I would trust with my health would be big pharma and big government. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=744.0s)]
*  Like those would be the last two I would look to. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=748.0s)]
*  You know, how much big pharma is done to just just push it through that they know is bad for you. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=752.0s)]
*  They know harms you. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=759.0s)]
*  And in this case, they know what's happened. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=761.0s)]
*  They know. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=764.0s)]
*  And all we're left with after the what was it, eighty six that they mandated that you couldn't sue the vaccine company. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=765.0s)]
*  And so since then, we've only been left with VARS, right? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=773.0s)]
*  Yeah, VARS. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=777.0s)]
*  Yeah, the government VARS, the government website. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=778.0s)]
*  And then we have millions of people who fought through the red tape and then the bureaucratic whatever just to just to an honest anonymously be known that they were injured. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=782.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=795.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=797.0s)]
*  It was weird watching so many people that I thought were intelligent stand up for the government and for the the pharmaceutical industry. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=798.0s)]
*  And but it's not weird if you think of how. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=809.0s)]
*  I mean, it was ubiquitous. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=813.0s)]
*  It never stopped. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=815.0s)]
*  The mainstream press was just harping on it constantly. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=817.0s)]
*  Yeah, constantly. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=821.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=823.0s)]
*  But it's just weird that so many people went along with it without question. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=824.0s)]
*  I mean, and especially the weirdest part was it was the people on the left. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=827.0s)]
*  That was so confusing to me because all my life, people on the left were very, very hesitant to believe anything that Big Pharma said and always distrusting in any major institution that was profiting off of something. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=831.0s)]
*  And all the it was all very clear. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=847.0s)]
*  You could see where the motivation was with everything. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=849.0s)]
*  You could see the amount of profit that was going to be generated. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=852.0s)]
*  And still, everybody was just so scared. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=854.0s)]
*  It just exposed a lot of cowards, a lot of fools, a lot of cowards and a lot of people that are just at the moment of any form of adversity are willing to just bow down and do what the system tells them to. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=857.0s)]
*  It's very strange. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=872.0s)]
*  Well, yes, I mean, to say cowards, it's interesting because of the nature of it being so mandated. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=874.0s)]
*  You know, I had many people I know got vaccinated because they wanted to be able to fly. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=889.0s)]
*  They wanted to be able to work. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=895.0s)]
*  So when it's mandated that you can't work, you know, how many drivers? [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=897.0s)]
*  Every single driver had to be vaccinated. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=903.0s)]
*  And in Atlanta, every person on the crew had to be vaccinated. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=906.0s)]
*  And you if it was you had the first vaccination. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=913.0s)]
*  But when you got the what do you call the next the boosters, the booster, it had to be within six months. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=917.0s)]
*  If it's six months in a day, you won't work that day. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=924.0s)]
*  You know, it was very regimented. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=927.0s)]
*  Everybody in every crew, including people that had already been sick. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=929.0s)]
*  It didn't even make sense. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=935.0s)]
*  Not only that, if you talk to virologists, they say you never vaccinate during a pandemic because it encourages variance. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=936.0s)]
*  You know, I posted that on Twitter, the study on Twitter. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=942.0s)]
*  So many people were attacking him. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=945.0s)]
*  I'm like, hey, I'm right. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=946.0s)]
*  The study is a study that shows that when you vaccinate with a non sterilizing vaccine during a pandemic, it encouraged encourages variance. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=947.0s)]
*  And that's what happened. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=957.0s)]
*  And they were blaming me non sterilizing. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=958.0s)]
*  So it doesn't a vaccine that doesn't actually prevent you from catching the disease or spreading the disease. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=961.0s)]
*  Oh, right. And that's what COVID is. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=967.0s)]
*  That's what initially it was supposed to stop you. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=969.0s)]
*  It was 100 percent going to stop the. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=971.0s)]
*  And then, of course, that guy had to be modified. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=974.0s)]
*  It came to now. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=978.0s)]
*  It will lessen your symptoms. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=980.0s)]
*  They're completely unprovable. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=982.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, there was never any studies. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=984.0s)]
*  Never any studies ever in the beginning that ever showed that it stopped transmission. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=986.0s)]
*  None. Right. Zero. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=991.0s)]
*  All it did is it showed that it had an immune response. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=992.0s)]
*  So you read Bobby's book. Oh, yeah. Yeah. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=996.0s)]
*  And even the guy, interestingly, you know, Kerry Mullis, I believe his name, the guy who created the PCR tests or well, there was some discrepancy with other people. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1000.0s)]
*  But anyway, it doesn't matter. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1013.0s)]
*  But the guy credited, he said this vaccine, this this test cannot prove infection. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1014.0s)]
*  Doesn't it doesn't prove causation. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1026.0s)]
*  So in other words, you may you're having a response that says that you have a viral load, but you don't know what the cause of that is. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1030.0s)]
*  You don't know what generated that. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1040.0s)]
*  It can't prove what the illness is. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1042.0s)]
*  Not only that. What the problem is that causes that. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1045.0s)]
*  Depending upon the amount of cycles that you run the PCR. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1048.0s)]
*  I mean, you could detect like the most minute amount that is not indicative of the person being infected. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1051.0s)]
*  Right. And that person will have a false positive and they there's false positives were through the fucking roof. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1058.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1063.0s)]
*  Yeah. The whole thing made no sense. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1065.0s)]
*  And it was just designed to push a vaccine that they profited off of massively. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1067.0s)]
*  And I hope we learn. I hope we learn. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1071.0s)]
*  I hope next time things roll around, people are a lot more hesitant to just jump in and believe this shit. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1073.0s)]
*  Well, already they were coming up with additional vaccines for this or that or another booster. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1079.0s)]
*  And people were like, yeah, no. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1085.0s)]
*  So I think people have already started to question the validity of things. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1088.0s)]
*  Well, I think this pandemic and the response and the mandates and all that shit, it it it ruined people's faith in. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1094.0s)]
*  First of all, the mainstream media, I think the mainstream media took the biggest hit out of anybody like the trust in the television shows and the newspapers that are supposed to be delivering the truth is at an all time low. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1104.0s)]
*  Well, I hope you're right. Oh, it's I think I think I'm right. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1118.0s)]
*  Pretty obvious. I mean, the ratings are down on every fucking show there is newspapers. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1122.0s)]
*  You mean no one wants to buy them since. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. OK. I didn't know that. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1128.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. CNN is fucking no one's watching anymore. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1133.0s)]
*  MSNBC is is a ghost town. No one's watching these shows because they're all just lying. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1136.0s)]
*  They're lying. They're still lying. They're lying constantly. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1141.0s)]
*  And now, you know, now they're lying about the Department of Government Efficiency when before they were lying about van pandemics and vaccines. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1144.0s)]
*  It's just it's not really the news. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1153.0s)]
*  You know, if it was the news, they wouldn't be paid for by the pharmaceutical drug companies. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1156.0s)]
*  You can't have the fucking news sponsored by the people that you're supposed to be reporting on and then you never report on them. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1160.0s)]
*  That's just crazy. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1166.0s)]
*  Well, also that that hold a trusted news initiative. Yeah. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1169.0s)]
*  You familiar with that? Yeah. Yeah. I guess you would be. Yeah. You talk to Bobby and everybody. Yeah. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1174.0s)]
*  But yeah, the trusted news initiative is just like, OK, we won't we won't. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1181.0s)]
*  You like when you I'd send a YouTube video that I just got to someone else. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1186.0s)]
*  And by the time it gets to them, they're like, it won't let me watch it. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Why? [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1192.0s)]
*  You know, misinformation. But isn't misinformation also information? Yeah. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1198.0s)]
*  You know, it's like how can you term it misinformation and what what you know, what are your criteria that allow you to call that misinformation? [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1206.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I'm hoping people have learned that it was a weird time, an educational time, though. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1219.0s)]
*  It was a good, good experience for some people to just to learn that, like, hey, like there's sources that you cannot trust. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1225.0s)]
*  And I think now the beautiful thing about someone like Elon buying Twitter and turning it into X and having community notes is now you have a way of fact checking things [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1233.0s)]
*  where people use the community notes and they start posting studies in the community notes and saying, no, this story is not true. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1245.0s)]
*  Here's why it's not true. Here's why it's provably not true. You know, so this is the best way to handle misinformation. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1251.0s)]
*  It's not leave it up to government sensors. Yeah. You know, and that was where everybody was going in 2020. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1258.0s)]
*  It was just fucking crazy. Those weren't government sensors. Those were the these were the mainstream media censoring themselves. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1265.0s)]
*  Well, yeah. Yeah. But I mean, at the behest of government, but also at the behest of Big Pharma. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1273.0s)]
*  Well, we found out that the government was actively contacting social media companies and having them remove things that were true. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1281.0s)]
*  Oh, because there was malinformation that could do that. That term. I haven't heard. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1290.0s)]
*  So there's misinformation, disinformation and malinformation. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1295.0s)]
*  Malinformation is true, but could have a detrimental effect on society. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1300.0s)]
*  True information that can have a detrimental effect on society is malinformation that also should be censored. It's Orwell. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1306.0s)]
*  It's right out of right out of 1984. It's crazy. I feel so Orwellian. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1314.0s)]
*  I mean, I guess the time we've gone through and the time we're in, it feels extremely Orwellian. It's very weird. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1320.0s)]
*  It's a weird time, but I'm optimistic. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1328.0s)]
*  I want to be optimistic. I think cynicism is the worst disease of old age. You know, you want your cynical. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1334.0s)]
*  You are fucked. Yeah, just it affects every part of your being, you know, but you say very positive, right? [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1342.0s)]
*  Yeah. You're just you seem like nothing can stop you. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1351.0s)]
*  I try to stay positive. Yeah. I mean, I'm affected like everybody else is. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1357.0s)]
*  I was down during the pandemic. It bothered the shit out of me. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1362.0s)]
*  But, you know, we came through it on the other end that I think people have more resolve now. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1365.0s)]
*  I think generally the general public has at least a good percentage of the general public has a healthy distrust now for bullshit. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1369.0s)]
*  Certainly your listeners. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1376.0s)]
*  Now, but after that Robert Malone thing happened, I was really curious. I was wanting to contact you and I didn't. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1379.0s)]
*  But but I was just curious how because, man, I never seen anyone take more body blows. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1386.0s)]
*  But I got to say it was cool. They would like stood behind you. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1392.0s)]
*  Is it Spotify? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Spotify. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1396.0s)]
*  Well, fortunately, they're not American. It's not an American company. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1400.0s)]
*  You know. Oh, yeah. They're sweet. Where are they from? Sweden. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1403.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. So they're like, yeah, we're not buying it. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1407.0s)]
*  Also, it was the show is big enough where they were like, why would we pull this thing off the air? [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1413.0s)]
*  Let's hang in there and see what happens. And it just kept getting bigger. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1418.0s)]
*  And so they're realizing the people were basically on the side of free distribution of information and they didn't buy it. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1422.0s)]
*  But there was two two two guys, Peter McCullough and Robert Malone. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1429.0s)]
*  Those are the ones. And then there was like some. Oh, yeah. Peter McCullough. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1433.0s)]
*  Boy, he took a lot of hits. He did. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1436.0s)]
*  Time during most published doctor in human history in his particular field of study. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1438.0s)]
*  I mean, he's well respected, rock solid credentialed. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1445.0s)]
*  And it was one of his videos I tried to send right after I got it. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1449.0s)]
*  I tried to send the people. No, they were so quick. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1453.0s)]
*  I've never seen such quick censorship or editing. Yeah. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1457.0s)]
*  Well, almost impressive. You know, it was creepy. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1462.0s)]
*  What was it like in Hollywood having your perspective, your healthy distrust of what was going on where everybody was sort of in lockstep with whatever the government propaganda was? [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1466.0s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. Well, you know, I mean, I don't know how many sets you visited, but everybody was like, you know, in mass. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1478.0s)]
*  Yeah. And then there'd be different zones. Yeah. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1486.0s)]
*  And then, you know, you get the closer you get to the actual set where the shooting is and then that red zone people put your mask on. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1490.0s)]
*  And I just say I never bought it. And I, you know, I never bought it from the beginning. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1499.0s)]
*  I'm just like, I don't I just this doesn't feel right. All right. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1505.0s)]
*  I'm supposed to wear a mask, but I haven't been. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1510.0s)]
*  Now, at this point, this right now, I haven't been sick in eight years. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1514.0s)]
*  Right. Well, back then was whatever six years. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1519.0s)]
*  But but it was just like I knew. Well, no, I'm doing the math. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1523.0s)]
*  But you know what I mean? It had been a long time since I'd been sick. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1527.0s)]
*  And I'm like, I don't feel like I need to wear a mask. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1531.0s)]
*  So I I would just not wear a mask, you know, but everybody else on the sets wearing a mask, which is very discomforting because, you know, you can't even relate to people so well without seeing their face. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1534.0s)]
*  It's very weird. It was very weird. Very strange time. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1549.0s)]
*  Yeah, the strangest. And it didn't make any sense. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1553.0s)]
*  There was also this narrative that if you weren't vaccinated, the vaccine, the virus is going to hunt you down. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1556.0s)]
*  They keep saying that the virus will find you if you're not vaccinated, the virus will hunt you down. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1561.0s)]
*  Like, what is what the fuck are you talking about? [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1569.0s)]
*  It's so funny. I like I did a video. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1572.0s)]
*  I wish I had it with me. But maybe Ilya's out there. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1576.0s)]
*  My assistant, maybe she could pull it up for you. Is it online? [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1581.0s)]
*  I did. No, but I did. It's 11 seconds. Yeah, she's listening. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1584.0s)]
*  Hopefully she'll look at it. But it's like it's it's I take I take inhale and hit a pot. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1589.0s)]
*  Right. And then I put on my mask and blow it right to the and I exhale. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1598.0s)]
*  And it no, it just comes out every right. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1602.0s)]
*  And in every exhale and by the way, hundreds of times heavier than like a virus. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1606.0s)]
*  Right. Right. So viruses don't just you know what the concept people have for people saying, you know, trust in science, very unscientific concepts. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1613.0s)]
*  Yeah. And Fauci anyway, in the beginning, no, we don't need to wear a mask. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1624.0s)]
*  And then someone said, no, you do. Oh, we do. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1629.0s)]
*  We should wear a mask. And yeah, so so silly that mask man that just something about it felt like, you know, it was just like Big Brother one. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1632.0s)]
*  Yeah. Big Brother one. They want to battle. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1646.0s)]
*  But I want to ultimately that's going to that's what's going to cost them the war. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1649.0s)]
*  I think what do you think Bobby's going to be able to think you'll be able to accomplish anything? [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1653.0s)]
*  You know, you're going to have to do something, forget about it after the trial period ends and then you're charged month after month after month. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1683.0s)]
*  Subscriptions are there, but you're not using them. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1690.0s)]
*  In fact, I just learned that 85 percent of people have at least one paid subscription going unused each month. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1693.0s)]

*  Well, one big one that he wants to accomplish is to remove this liability waiver for vaccines. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1777.0s)]
*  And to make them go through real trials. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1784.0s)]
*  And how do you think that's going to get through Congress? [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1789.0s)]
*  We're going to find out. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1792.0s)]
*  Come on, dude. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1793.0s)]
*  We're going to find out. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1794.0s)]
*  There's no way that gets through Congress. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1795.0s)]
*  We'll see. You know, we'll see. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1797.0s)]
*  We'll see what the resistance is. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1799.0s)]
*  But every one of those guys is getting money from big pharma. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1800.0s)]
*  A lot of them are. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1803.0s)]
*  But also... [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1804.0s)]
*  Certainly all the Democrats. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1805.0s)]
*  People are paying attention now and they will get primaried. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1807.0s)]
*  And I think they're aware of that. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1809.0s)]
*  So I think there's a vulnerability for their entire career. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1811.0s)]
*  If people find out that they weren't willing to do this in the face of overwhelming evidence. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1813.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1819.0s)]
*  Like Bobby was just talking about the hepatitis vaccine. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1820.0s)]
*  That they were saying that the hepatitis B vaccine, they were having a hard time selling it. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1823.0s)]
*  And so they all of a sudden start saying, don't worry about it. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1827.0s)]
*  We're going to prescribe it for children. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1831.0s)]
*  And they put it on the vaccine schedule for children. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1832.0s)]
*  And they did that just because they were having a hard time. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1834.0s)]
*  Because the only time you get hepatitis B is from dirty needles and risky sex. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1837.0s)]
*  And people are like, I don't want that fucking thing. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1842.0s)]
*  And so they're like, nobody wants to take it. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1845.0s)]
*  You want to stand by that statement. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1847.0s)]
*  Those are the only times you get hepatitis B. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1848.0s)]
*  I think that's it. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1851.0s)]
*  And there's just two possibilities. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1852.0s)]
*  Dirty sex and dirty needles. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1854.0s)]
*  Do you know of any other ones? [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1856.0s)]
*  I mean, I think... [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1857.0s)]
*  It's a sexually transmitted disease. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1858.0s)]
*  Oh, it is? Okay, okay. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1860.0s)]
*  It's transmitted through intravenous drug use. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1861.0s)]
*  Okay, then I didn't know. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1864.0s)]
*  Yeah, how do you think you got hepatitis B? [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1866.0s)]
*  I mean, I just assume you get run down. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1868.0s)]
*  Like most sick people, you get run down, you get sick. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1870.0s)]
*  Well, let's Google it. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1873.0s)]
*  What is the cause of hepatitis B, Jamie? [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1874.0s)]
*  Infected blood or body fluids. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1876.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's how you get it. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1878.0s)]
*  You don't get it as a fucking baby. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1880.0s)]
*  So injecting babies with it, the only reason why they did that is to sell more hepatitis B vaccines. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1882.0s)]
*  Yeah, if the mother has it. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1887.0s)]
*  Unprotected sex with a defected person, mother to child, during childbirth, breastfeeding. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1889.0s)]
*  If the mother's infected. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1893.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1895.0s)]
*  Uh-huh. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1896.0s)]
*  So tattooing. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1897.0s)]
*  Dude, you got a lot of avenues you could be. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1898.0s)]
*  Yeah, I guess dirty needles. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1901.0s)]
*  I guess that falls under dirty needles. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1904.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1907.0s)]
*  But anyway, I just wonder that, you know, it just, again, the profiteering, like why are we not talking about profiteering? [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1908.0s)]
*  That should be on everyone's lips. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1917.0s)]
*  Exactly. That's what it's all about. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1919.0s)]
*  That's all the woes and ills of our society. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1921.0s)]
*  It's people emphasizing profit over humanity. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1925.0s)]
*  That's really what it is. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1930.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1931.0s)]
*  That's really what it is. Yeah. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1932.0s)]
*  I agree. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1934.0s)]
*  Yeah, and it's also, it's like, it's this fucking disgustingly short-sighted approach because you don't live that long. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1935.0s)]
*  To live your life just profiteering off of the expense of other people's suffering is so crazy. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1943.0s)]
*  When you've got 80 years, if you're lucky, you got 80 summers, 80 summers, 80 spins around the sun, and you're going to fucking sell people out for some money that you're never going to have enough of anyway. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1949.0s)]
*  All those cocksuckers, they all want more. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1964.0s)]
*  It never ends. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1966.0s)]
*  They all want a bigger yacht. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1968.0s)]
*  They all wanted this. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1969.0s)]
*  They all wanted that. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1970.0s)]
*  There was always something. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1971.0s)]
*  It never ends. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1972.0s)]
*  And somehow I know that we let them get away with it because we're profiting as well. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1973.0s)]
*  I was wondering about like billionaires. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1978.0s)]
*  You got to figure there's a certain hierarchy of billionaires. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1981.0s)]
*  And so even if you're a billionaire and you're thinking, well, that guy's he's good. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1985.0s)]
*  He's made it. Right. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1990.0s)]
*  Nope. Well, no, I want to be the richest guy. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1991.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I don't know. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1994.0s)]
*  I guess it never does end in a way. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1996.0s)]
*  Well, if that's what your game is. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=1998.0s)]
*  Right. So if your game is just numbers, you're never going to be satisfied. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2000.0s)]
*  You know, if your game is just numbers, you're always going to look at the other people. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2004.0s)]
*  Like my friend Brian has a friend that has three billion dollars and he says he hangs out with his billionaire friends and he feels poor because they have 30 billion dollars. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2008.0s)]
*  You know, crazy. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2018.0s)]
*  Imagine having three billion dollars and feel poor. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2020.0s)]
*  But I can kind of understand the thought. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2024.0s)]
*  I mean, it's stupid. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2027.0s)]
*  The poor white trash. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2028.0s)]
*  Only three bills. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2030.0s)]
*  Poor bastard. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2035.0s)]
*  How's he even buy a country? [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2036.0s)]
*  How do you even affect elections with three billion dollars? [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2038.0s)]
*  That's nothing. Yeah. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2041.0s)]
*  That's weird. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2042.0s)]
*  Local election. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2043.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, this is just a symptom of the moral decay of our society that, you know, we don't we don't have a moral and ethical framework. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2044.0s)]
*  We don't have a moral and ethical structure that we operate under. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2057.0s)]
*  And too many people are just motivated by my money instead of humanity and sort of looking at people as like a community for a community of people. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2062.0s)]
*  And you can still profit and you can still make money. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2071.0s)]
*  But like making more money at the expense of people's lives and suffering should be the most abhorrent thing that we could possibly imagine, especially if you're already wealthy. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2074.0s)]
*  That should be absolutely disgusting to us and that it's condoned and just like accepted. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2086.0s)]
*  And, you know, you shrug your shoulders. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2091.0s)]
*  That's what people do. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2093.0s)]
*  Well, I think I think the majority of people agree with you 100 percent on that. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2094.0s)]
*  And majority people have a very humane and compassionate view of others. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2099.0s)]
*  You know. Yeah. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2106.0s)]
*  But there are those people who are just, you know, it's like you say, it's a numbers game. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2107.0s)]
*  Yeah. And and unfortunately, war makes people really rich. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2112.0s)]
*  Yeah. Gets a lot. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2120.0s)]
*  It's I mean, I guess I don't know. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2122.0s)]
*  Big Pharma would be the number one industry, but not far behind. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2125.0s)]
*  It's got to be the weapons industry. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2130.0s)]
*  Yeah. And it's just like, why are these if you even get away from why are these wars happening? [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2133.0s)]
*  Or are they justified? [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2141.0s)]
*  Why are they making that much profit off of these wars? [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2143.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know, strange. Yeah. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2147.0s)]
*  That bothers me. I get sleepless over that. It should. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2151.0s)]
*  Especially because the United States is just done. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2155.0s)]
*  You know, I you know, one World War Two. OK, I give you that one. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2158.0s)]
*  You know, but I don't give you the Korean War over the potential domino theory, which was absurd. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2162.0s)]
*  The same theory that so four million four million people die in Korea. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2169.0s)]
*  Three and a half million in Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2175.0s)]
*  They started carpet bombing in Laos, you know, which is everything in a two mile radius presumed dead. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2180.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know what we've done throughout Central South America all over the world. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2187.0s)]
*  We've become masters of war. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2192.0s)]
*  But like toward what end to help those rich people get richer? [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2194.0s)]
*  Yeah. It's like I would understand if it's a justifiable, you know, you have to stop Hitler. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2199.0s)]
*  Mussolini. I get it. Yeah. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2206.0s)]
*  But, you know, come on. It's crazy that it all really boils down to that. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2208.0s)]
*  It really boils down to a lot of his people profiting. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2213.0s)]
*  You know, I always have said that if war weren't so lucrative, there'd be a lot less of it. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2216.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know, no doubt. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2223.0s)]
*  Sometimes just the war itself is that's a moneymaker. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2226.0s)]
*  Yeah. But it's like, how do you fucking do that? What do you got there, fella? [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2230.0s)]
*  I brought this for you, man. What is it? [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2233.0s)]
*  It's a it's a very nice Northern California. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2236.0s)]
*  You know, I have a dispensary in LA. Yeah. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2240.0s)]
*  Call it the woods. It's phenomenal. It's the most beautiful dispensary in the world. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2245.0s)]
*  It's amazing. You can have a I remember when it was completely, totally illegal. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2249.0s)]
*  And then you had to have a medical card. And right. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2254.0s)]
*  And you just say you had a headache. That's all you have to say. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2258.0s)]
*  You got back pain, you got a headache, you can get a subscription or prescription rather. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2263.0s)]
*  And then it became legal. But just in 2016. It's not here. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2267.0s)]
*  No, it's decriminalized. It needs to be legal in Texas. It should be. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2270.0s)]
*  Well, it should be federally legal. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2273.0s)]
*  This could be such a this state's so great anyway. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2275.0s)]
*  We could we could change everything if Texas was legal. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2279.0s)]
*  Well, the whole country should be legal. Yeah. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2283.0s)]
*  The idea that America, the land of the free, criminalizes the use of a plant that's never killed anybody is fucking crazy. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2285.0s)]
*  It's legislating morality. And it's an odd morality anyway, because most people believe you should be able to smoke if you want. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2292.0s)]
*  Not only that, it's a morality that's based off bullshit about profiteering from the 1930s. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2299.0s)]
*  So propaganda from the 1930s that's still working today, 90 years later, which is really crazy. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2305.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's the craziest part of it. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2312.0s)]
*  And that the really the only reason why I picked up steam is because they needed to put people to work after they had stopped banning alcohol. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2314.0s)]
*  So prohibition ended. Everybody's like, what do we do now? [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2321.0s)]
*  Well, let's fucking go after marijuana. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2324.0s)]
*  And then you get Harry Anslinger, will you have Randolph Hearst? [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2326.0s)]
*  They're all profiting from it. And they all fucking make the marijuana movies like Reefer Madness. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2329.0s)]
*  And everyone's going to go crazy. And to this day, there's a lot of people who believe that they think it makes you lazy. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2334.0s)]
*  It makes you stupid. And it really is. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2340.0s)]
*  Although I would say my stupid quotient. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2344.0s)]
*  I'm dipped down to a new low. No, but I agree with you. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2349.0s)]
*  I think that, yeah, like Anslinger, nobody knows about that. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2353.0s)]
*  How this guy went all over the place and got governments all over the world to make, you know, declare this the enemy drug. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2357.0s)]
*  And but, you know, like I really just believe, you know, there's such a thing as a consensual crime, which is victimless crimes. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2365.0s)]
*  So if I'm smoking a joint, well, a lot of it's like the vaccine. If I'm smoking a joint, how does that hurt you? [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2375.0s)]
*  Right. What am I doing to hurt you? [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2382.0s)]
*  If you drive and fall asleep at the wheel and slide into a school bus. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2385.0s)]
*  Well, that's one thing, of course. Yeah, but there's already laws for that. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2388.0s)]
*  Okay, yeah, but that's another, okay, outside of the driving world, I don't see how I'm hurting you. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2391.0s)]
*  Outside of the driving world, that's really the end of it. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2397.0s)]
*  And if I'm not getting my job done, then fire me. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2400.0s)]
*  Okay, so there's it just there's no and by the way, most people do agree with this. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2403.0s)]
*  But when you have like over 70 percent of the people in jail are there for victimless crimes, yes, mostly drug related crimes. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2409.0s)]
*  Well, then we go back to another thing, profiteering, because we have private prisons, which is crazy. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2420.0s)]
*  We're essentially taking human beings and you're using them as batteries to generate money. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2427.0s)]
*  That's really what you're doing. Yeah. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2432.0s)]
*  The more people you get in there, the more profit you're pulling out of it, which is just crazy. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2434.0s)]
*  So then you have prison guard unions that are lobbying to keep laws on the books. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2438.0s)]
*  Victimless crimes on the books like like marijuana. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2443.0s)]
*  Yeah, I imagine there's a lot of unions pushing it. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2447.0s)]
*  But, you know, I didn't know till I saw the 13th. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2452.0s)]
*  Is that what it was called? That movie? Thirteenth Amendment? It was about the 13th Amendment. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2456.0s)]
*  I didn't know about the. What's it called? [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2462.0s)]
*  There's a movie I think it's called The 13th. I'm not wrong. Yeah. Is that right? Yeah. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2466.0s)]
*  Anyway, it. Oh, there it is. Yeah. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2473.0s)]
*  That's the first time I really thought about in spite of being around prisons, you know, much of my life. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2477.0s)]
*  I had never thought about the fact that they're there. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2484.0s)]
*  That that's just they're they're making them work. It's just slave slave labor. Exactly. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2489.0s)]
*  Just yeah, making them work. I'd never thought about it. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2496.0s)]
*  Slave labor for insanely small amount of money and they keep them locked up and they produce things. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2499.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2506.0s)]
*  And when you watch that, you believe it for sure. Did you see that? [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2508.0s)]
*  No, I didn't see it. I'm aware of the law. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2512.0s)]
*  I mean, I'm aware of that's that's a lot of where the Jim Crow laws came from. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2515.0s)]
*  When they then they abolish slavery. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2519.0s)]
*  What they did was just arrest people for basically anything and put them to work. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2521.0s)]
*  I mean, that was right. That was the modus operandi. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2525.0s)]
*  Yeah, which is I guess that's when all that the 13th started was back then. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2528.0s)]
*  Yeah. As a part of the Jim Crow law goes the same thing profit. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2533.0s)]
*  And ironically, a lot of this lack of compassion could be solved with psychedelics. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2537.0s)]
*  A lot of it, a lot of it where people expand their consciousness, [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2544.0s)]
*  understand that what they're doing is morally reprehensible. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2548.0s)]
*  Even though you can sort of justify it because it's legal. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2553.0s)]
*  It's disgusting. We should change those laws. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2555.0s)]
*  Those laws don't make any sense because written on paper doesn't mean it's just doesn't mean it makes sense for logical, rational people. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2557.0s)]
*  I agree. It'd be nice to get some acid in the punch bowl at some kind of congressional. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2565.0s)]
*  You know, well, consensually, I think, you know, consensual. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2571.0s)]
*  I mean, you're not going to get all those guys who needed to agree to it. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2575.0s)]
*  So I'm just saying throw a little in the punch bowl. They're all going by the punch bowl. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2579.0s)]
*  Do you ever do you know who Graham Hancock is? [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2583.0s)]
*  He's an expert on ancient history, like a kind of a renegade historian. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2587.0s)]
*  He's got a sort of alternative version of ancient society, ancient civilizations. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2594.0s)]
*  But the point is like he's all he has a podcast. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2603.0s)]
*  He's got a two seasons of a series called Ancient Apocalypse on Netflix. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2606.0s)]
*  It's really amazing. It's all is basically his field of study is the evidence that human beings and human civilization has gone through a reset. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2612.0s)]
*  And that somewhere around 12000 years ago. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2622.0s)]
*  And this is all supported by this this theory called the Younger Dryas Impact Theory, [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2625.0s)]
*  where they found evidence that the earth was bombarded by comets at more than two different times in history that probably reset civilization. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2632.0s)]
*  And that this is probably why you see like like ancient structures that people can't explain and that, you know, [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2642.0s)]
*  these stone buildings that have incredibly complex geometry and precision building from thousands and thousands of thousands of years ago. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2648.0s)]
*  Chicago, like they had all those buildings. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2657.0s)]
*  That's a little different. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2660.0s)]
*  You're talking about that? [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2661.0s)]
*  No, that's a little different. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2662.0s)]
*  I'm talking about like ancient Egypt. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2663.0s)]
*  You're talking about super ancient. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2664.0s)]
*  Turkey, you know, I'm talking about like Gobekli Tepe and these ancient structures. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2666.0s)]
*  They found that are absolutely 11000 plus years old, where people are supposed to be just hunter and gatherers. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2671.0s)]
*  And that we had thought up until, you know, last 40 or 50 years that society emerged around 6000 years ago in Mesopotamia. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2677.0s)]
*  What he believes is that that is a reemergence of society and that society had already reached a very high level of sophistication around 12000 years ago. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2686.0s)]
*  And that something happened, some sort of gigantic cataclysm and reset things. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2695.0s)]
*  But Graham is also an enthusiast of ayahuasca and the power of psychedelic medicine. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2700.0s)]
*  And he has often said that to run governments, it should be mandatory that you have psychedelic sessions. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2706.0s)]
*  And you should probably do it publicly. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2714.0s)]
*  Hopefully. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2717.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, imagine getting Lindsey Graham fucked up on mushrooms and then filming. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2720.0s)]
*  I would love to see that. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2727.0s)]
*  It would be amazing. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2729.0s)]
*  What I would give to see that. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2730.0s)]
*  Oh, it would be amazing. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2732.0s)]
*  But it would be nice if they had a little more because it's almost those drugs that you're talking about are just like it's like the universal. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2733.0s)]
*  So God's little helper. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2743.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2746.0s)]
*  Help you see how the world really works. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2747.0s)]
*  God's little helper. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2749.0s)]
*  The illusory nature of what it is we're experiencing. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2750.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2753.0s)]
*  And to come from the heart. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2754.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2755.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2756.0s)]
*  Yeah, they they encourage compassion and they encourage kindness and love. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2757.0s)]
*  And that's we need a lot more of that in this world. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2761.0s)]
*  And that's the problem with being so politically and ideologically divided. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2764.0s)]
*  It's so it's so easy because people are so tribal. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2769.0s)]
*  It's so easy to hate the other tribe, the other people, the enemy. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2772.0s)]
*  You know, and so we've got this bizarre thing where we're supposed to be a community, but we're a two sided community and one side hates the other side. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2775.0s)]
*  And whoever is in power, those those those people are the problem. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2782.0s)]
*  It's like that is such a weird part of the human, you know, you had nature or whatever you want to call it. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2785.0s)]
*  Psychology is like and I noticed just the other day there was some dude like I was I can't remember what the context was, but I remember he kind of came into my zone and I thought, look at this fucking guy, man. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2794.0s)]
*  He's got such an asshole. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2808.0s)]
*  You could just tell you could just feel it. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2810.0s)]
*  You know, and then and then I thought, why are you what you've got nothing that tells you that that's true. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2812.0s)]
*  You know, right. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2820.0s)]
*  Other than maybe you're jealous because he's more handsome than you are. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2821.0s)]
*  So I mean, anyway, and so I go, how are you doing? [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2825.0s)]
*  And he smiles and I'm like, this guy's incredible. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2830.0s)]
*  You know, like you just all you need to do sometimes is just generate a smile on that other person who you think's an asshole's face. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2834.0s)]
*  And suddenly they're they're a kid. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2843.0s)]
*  You know, it's suddenly you're in a different you're you're using your kid juice to interact. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2846.0s)]
*  Well, that's like the important of the importance of charisma. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2852.0s)]
*  Right. Because a person isn't exactly who they are. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2855.0s)]
*  They're who they are when they interact with you. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2858.0s)]
*  And however you interact with them will affect the way they interact with you. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2860.0s)]
*  It's not it's a two way street. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2866.0s)]
*  Most sort of interactions, if they see a frown on your face, then inevitably there's a frown on their face. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2868.0s)]
*  Inevitably. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2875.0s)]
*  Yeah. But it smiles, generates smiles. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2876.0s)]
*  And if you think about it, that is the easiest energy generating thing is another person smile. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2879.0s)]
*  Sure. And getting you to smile and common ground. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2888.0s)]
*  You know, and I think we have that's the problem with the media and with political ideologies is that there's no currency in common ground. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2891.0s)]
*  The currency is all in division. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2903.0s)]
*  That's where you can gain the most momentum, get the most people on your side. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2905.0s)]
*  You have to say the other people are the enemy. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2909.0s)]
*  Common ground is much more common. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2911.0s)]
*  Most people agree. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2913.0s)]
*  Most people want to be safe. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2915.0s)]
*  They want to be healthy. They want to be happy. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2917.0s)]
*  They want to have friends. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2919.0s)]
*  They want to have a good time. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2920.0s)]
*  They want to have a nice family. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2921.0s)]
*  They want to be loved. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2923.0s)]
*  They want to have love. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2924.0s)]
*  That's most people. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2925.0s)]
*  And they think that the other people are trying to prevent that. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2926.0s)]
*  Instead of just accentuating those important factors and saying we should all concentrate on that and then we shall look at things that prevent that. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2928.0s)]
*  What are the things that prevent happiness and love and health? [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2937.0s)]
*  And let's let's all work collectively together to eliminate those aspects of our society. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2941.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2948.0s)]
*  The problem is, you know, make a lot of profit doing that. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2949.0s)]
*  You know, the profit is in the division. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2952.0s)]
*  The media does push the divide for sure. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2955.0s)]
*  The media is bullshit. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2958.0s)]
*  They're first of all, they're dying. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2959.0s)]
*  They're dying like AM radio. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2961.0s)]
*  They're not going to make it. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2963.0s)]
*  They're not going to make it. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2964.0s)]
*  The internet is more compelling and independent journalism is more accurate. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2965.0s)]
*  And it's going to be more and more. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2970.0s)]
*  Are you sure that's not a subjective vantage point, Joe? [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2972.0s)]
*  It's certainly subjective. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2975.0s)]
*  Yeah, it certainly is. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2977.0s)]
*  All your vantage points are subjective. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2978.0s)]
*  Yes, everything is subjective. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2980.0s)]
*  It's definitely subjective. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2982.0s)]
*  But I listen, I think there are very good people that work in journalism. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2983.0s)]
*  I think they're very good people that work in the New York Times, the Washington Post and even in CNN. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2987.0s)]
*  I know them. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2991.0s)]
*  I know people that work at CNN and I like them. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2992.0s)]
*  I know people that work at the New York Times and I like them very much. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2994.0s)]
*  The problem is the institution and the institution is based on profit. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=2997.0s)]
*  And where do you get your money? [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3002.0s)]
*  Well, you get a lot of your money from pharmaceutical drug companies, from NGOs. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3004.0s)]
*  There's funding from all these different political groups. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3009.0s)]
*  And that's the problem. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3012.0s)]
*  The problem is enormous entities that need incredible amounts of capital in order to stay relevant. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3016.0s)]
*  And in doing so, what's crazy is if you're in the information business, well, you can't be accurate. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3021.0s)]
*  You cannot be accurate about the distribution of information if your profits are based on you pushing a bullshit narrative. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3027.0s)]
*  Because those are the people that are supporting you. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3035.0s)]
*  So therefore, they're not going to make it. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3037.0s)]
*  It's like you see the writing on the wall. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3040.0s)]
*  It's like this is not tenable. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3042.0s)]
*  You're not going to be able to continue this. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3043.0s)]
*  You're going to either have to adjust course or you're going to be swallowed. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3045.0s)]
*  And that's what people realize that now with the Internet. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3048.0s)]
*  When you got people like Matt Taibbi and Michael Schellenberger and Glenn Greenwald, respected journalists who are now on the outside. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3053.0s)]
*  And so now they've amassed this huge following on the outside because, you know, if you go to Glenn Greenwald, he's going to tell you what's actually going on. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3062.0s)]
*  Why are we invading this? [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3071.0s)]
*  Why are we bombing this? [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3073.0s)]
*  What is going on? [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3075.0s)]
*  And he'll tell you it all goes back to 2013 when this was passed and this is what happened and they tried to do this. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3076.0s)]
*  And this is what we're trying to do because there's oil here or there's minerals there. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3082.0s)]
*  And like, oh, fuck. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3086.0s)]
*  And so but most people don't have the time to do that kind of a deep dive. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3088.0s)]
*  So you turn on CNN and CNN's is safe and effective. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3091.0s)]
*  Have you gotten your nice booster? [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3094.0s)]
*  Get your nice booster. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3096.0s)]
*  The fucking anchors are blacking out on TV and it's like, wow, like it's they're in a trap. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3099.0s)]
*  They're in a trap. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3106.0s)]
*  First of all, they're in a trap because of the actual format of the show sucks. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3107.0s)]
*  Right. Format of television show suck. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3112.0s)]
*  You have three talking heads yelling at each other five minutes before commercial. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3114.0s)]
*  Everyone's trying to get a sound bite that goes viral. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3119.0s)]
*  And then you cut to a commercial by the antidepressants and then you come back. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3121.0s)]
*  You come back and there's a flood and there's fucking Detroit's frozen. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3127.0s)]
*  Do you see that shit in Detroit? [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3131.0s)]
*  Well, they had a flood and then it froze. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3133.0s)]
*  And so you got cars like up to the fucking windshield frozen solid in the streets and car alarms going on. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3135.0s)]
*  I haven't seen that. Yeah, it happened yesterday. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3141.0s)]
*  There was some sort of a water main line broke probably because of the cold. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3143.0s)]
*  And then the streets flooded. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3147.0s)]
*  And then the streets when they flooded, then they froze. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3149.0s)]
*  And so all these cars like literally up to the windshield stuck. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3152.0s)]
*  See if you can find it. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3156.0s)]
*  It's crazy to look at. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3157.0s)]
*  Look at this entire streets filled. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3159.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3162.0s)]
*  And if you watch a video of it, all the car alarms are going off. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3163.0s)]
*  So the car alarms are going off and all the cars are frozen. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3166.0s)]
*  Give me some. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3170.0s)]
*  You can hear it if you put your microphone. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3171.0s)]
*  Yeah, put your headphones on. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3173.0s)]
*  Oh, that is wild. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3175.0s)]
*  So everybody's fucking car alarms going off because the cars getting crunched. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3180.0s)]
*  So the cars are getting disturbed. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3184.0s)]
*  So they're getting crunched. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3186.0s)]
*  The cars think that people are breaking into them. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3187.0s)]
*  Minus 70 degrees. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3190.0s)]
*  As if Detroit doesn't have enough fucking problems. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3191.0s)]
*  Poor Detroit. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3194.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3196.0s)]

*  Artists and artisans and companies that are like proud, like Shinola. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3215.0s)]

*  And they got the record player that he did with Mike White. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3240.0s)]
*  You know, the Mike White. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3246.0s)]
*  No. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3252.0s)]
*  Jack White? [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3253.0s)]
*  Jack White. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3254.0s)]
*  I knew that wasn't right. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3255.0s)]
*  Mike White makes the White Lotus. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3256.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, Jack White. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3258.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3260.0s)]
*  And they also do vinyl. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3261.0s)]
*  They make all these vinyls. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3263.0s)]
*  Those guys do cool stuff, man. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3265.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, last time I was in Detroit, I did the Fox Theater. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3267.0s)]
*  And I saw a lot of that too. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3270.0s)]
*  A lot of like small shops and cool places. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3272.0s)]
*  Because real estate is cheap. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3274.0s)]
*  So people are like moving in and artists are doing things. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3276.0s)]
*  And it's fun. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3280.0s)]
*  It's like a little bit of a revival after they got fucked by the auto industry. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3281.0s)]
*  Well, yeah, for sure. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3285.0s)]
*  More profiteering, right? [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3287.0s)]
*  Sent all the fucking jobs to other countries because you can get people to work for slave labor. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3288.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3291.0s)]
*  And now they're dealing with this incredible ice flood. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3292.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3298.0s)]
*  I think that's a small isolated area, but still pretty fucked. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3299.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3303.0s)]

*  Where do you live, though? [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3312.0s)]
*  Where do you spend most of your time? [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3313.0s)]
*  No, I live in Austin. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3315.0s)]
*  Oh, do you? [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3317.0s)]
*  I live in Austin. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3318.0s)]
*  I didn't know you lived here. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3319.0s)]
*  Yeah, I live in the drip. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3320.0s)]
*  Oh, nice. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3321.0s)]

*  I love it out there. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3323.0s)]
*  That's a nice place. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3324.0s)]
*  That's a nice area. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3325.0s)]
*  No, I'm determined. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3327.0s)]
*  You and I are going to have to hang out sometimes socially. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3329.0s)]
*  Let's do it. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3331.0s)]
*  I would love to do that. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3332.0s)]
*  Let's do it. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3333.0s)]

*  Okay, well, you don't feel just like you're back against the wall because we're on it. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3336.0s)]
*  No, I love you, man. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3339.0s)]

*  I'll go meet you somewhere. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3344.0s)]
*  I don't give a fuck. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3345.0s)]
*  Okay, perfect. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3346.0s)]

*  Oh, yeah. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3348.0s)]
*  Oh, right. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3349.0s)]
*  Yeah, about a comedy club on 6th Street. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3350.0s)]
*  What's it called? [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3351.0s)]
*  Comedy Mothership. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3352.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'd like to do that. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3353.0s)]
*  It's fun. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3354.5s)]
*  It's a great place. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3355.5s)]
*  My buddy Jimmy Dore is there this weekend who's also great, and he's filming his comedy [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3356.5s)]
*  special there this weekend. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3359.68s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3361.0s)]
*  Yeah, Jimmy Dore is amazing. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3362.0s)]
*  He's another guy that's risen as an independent journalist. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3364.0s)]
*  He's a comedian. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3367.0s)]
*  And he started his show basically just making fun of political things. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3368.32s)]
*  And then during the pandemic, got vaccine injured and really got kind of red-pilled [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3373.6400000000003s)]
*  and kind of became like the voice of truth and reason. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3377.96s)]
*  And another guy has been completely outcast by supposedly progressive people for just [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3381.84s)]
*  telling the truth, the inconvenient truth. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3388.48s)]
*  Inconvenient. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3391.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, but I guess the progressives, are they now the conservatives? [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3392.2000000000003s)]
*  We got to change the term because progressives seem a lot less progressive. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3397.72s)]
*  I really felt quite, you know, during this whole thing. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3403.4399999999996s)]
*  I think they got co-opted. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3407.12s)]
*  I felt quite, yeah. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3408.12s)]
*  I think they got co-opted and I think it was on purpose. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3409.12s)]
*  I think there was some very sophisticated psychological manipulation that was involved [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3411.8399999999997s)]
*  and a lot of money was being spent in order to push some very specific narratives. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3418.7599999999998s)]
*  And they did a great job of it. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3424.3999999999996s)]
*  They did a great job of it, but we're finding out because of the Department of Government [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3426.32s)]
*  Efficiency that most of this was funded by our own tax dollars, which is really fucking [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3429.8s)]
*  crazy. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3433.88s)]
*  A lot of these NGOs that supported a lot of these crazy riots and all these different [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3434.88s)]
*  things that were happening in our cities was really supported by our own tax dollars. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3438.88s)]
*  And it was just a subversion of public discourse. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3443.4s)]
*  You know, instead of allowing people to figure out what's right and what's wrong, they pushed [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3447.96s)]
*  what they wanted you to say. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3452.56s)]
*  And anybody who deviated from that was canceled. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3454.48s)]
*  And because of the fact that before Elon bought Twitter, the left had complete total control [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3457.44s)]
*  over the narrative because they owned all the social media sites and they were in lockstep [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3463.12s)]
*  with the government. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3467.12s)]
*  So it was just a dark time for information. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3468.12s)]
*  But a few brave people, you know, brave the storm. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3471.28s)]
*  And one of them was Jimmy. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3474.88s)]
*  Oh, that's good. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3475.88s)]
*  That's a good shout out to him. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3478.88s)]
*  I remember when the guy was, remember that guy, I think they were in London maybe, but [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3482.68s)]
*  it was the guy who was, I think, directed one portion of Pfizer. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3490.56s)]
*  And he met with some guy and he had a body cam. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3499.0s)]
*  The other guy had a body cam. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3502.84s)]
*  It was like a date on Tinder or something. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3504.52s)]
*  Oh, it was like one of those Project Veritas, James O'Keefe things. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3506.72s)]
*  Did you not see it? [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3510.3199999999997s)]
*  I'm sure I did. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3511.4s)]
*  But this is the perfect example of how the Trusted News Initiative managed to, a lot [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3512.4s)]
*  of news just never got to people because the guy had a body cam and is talking to him and [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3519.1600000000003s)]
*  the guy who works for Pfizer saying they just had a meeting talking about how they could [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3525.88s)]
*  weaponize these other viruses in order to basically create another pandemic to create [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3531.2400000000002s)]
*  so that they would have the vaccine to address it and make more money, which is not a surprising [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3539.3999999999996s)]
*  thing that they would be discussing. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3545.72s)]
*  But what was great was he admitted it to the guy while they're sitting there at a little [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3548.2799999999997s)]
*  diner. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3552.2799999999997s)]

*  It's always chatty gay guys. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3556.6s)]
*  It's always a guy on a date with another guy and he's like, I'll tell you what we're doing. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3558.08s)]
*  It's like they just chat it up. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3562.68s)]
*  The incredible thing like he got, the stuff that he said was incredible. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3564.92s)]
*  What was more incredible, he told the guy basically that he'd been filming him. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3569.88s)]
*  The guy freaks out. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3575.72s)]
*  Anyway, this should have been across every possible platform of media. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3577.0s)]
*  Of course. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3581.64s)]
*  And yet you did not see it zero in mainstream media. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3582.2s)]
*  But because Musk had bought Twitter, Musk put it on and immediately got 40 million views [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3586.6s)]
*  and also, what's his name, Tucker Carlson put it on and then there was a lot of views [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3593.72s)]
*  that way. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3598.2s)]
*  But other than that, but if you ask your average person, they never heard of this incident. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3598.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3603.64s)]
*  It's like an amazing thing talking about what's the term for that? [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3603.8799999999997s)]
*  The weaponization of a virus. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3608.52s)]
*  Do you know? [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3612.2s)]
*  He's looking at a term for the weaponization of a virus. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3613.9599999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3617.9599999999996s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3619.0s)]
*  Anyway, they do it. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3620.3599999999997s)]
*  But that's what they think that they were doing in China. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3623.08s)]
*  100%. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3629.3199999999997s)]
*  That they were weaponizing. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3629.88s)]
*  Well, that was why you would get banned off of all these social media platforms if you [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3630.84s)]
*  even brought that up. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3634.52s)]
*  It used to be if you brought that up on YouTube, you get pulled from YouTube. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3636.2799999999997s)]
*  Now it's a fact. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3640.2s)]
*  Right. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3640.84s)]
*  Now it's a fact. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3641.08s)]
*  Now it's an undeniable fact. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3642.36s)]
*  All the things, like you said about Robert Malone, all the things that he said are now [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3645.16s)]
*  fact. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3649.24s)]
*  Everything. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3650.12s)]
*  Every single one of them. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3650.7599999999998s)]
*  The fact that the injection doesn't stay locally, that it infects various parts of [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3652.12s)]
*  your body in different ways. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3656.8399999999997s)]
*  If it gets to your heart, it's very dangerous because your heart doesn't have the ability [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3657.64s)]
*  to heal, which is why you don't get heart cancer. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3660.68s)]
*  So your heart just scars over and you get myocarditis. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3662.44s)]
*  He started talking about all these different effects and he personally was vaccine injured. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3665.56s)]
*  So he's a guy who took it, almost had a fucking heart attack. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3670.6s)]
*  I was like, what is going on? [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3673.16s)]
*  His whole body freaked out. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3675.24s)]
*  It was deadly sick. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3676.7599999999998s)]
*  Managed to get through it. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3678.52s)]
*  Then started speaking out against it. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3679.72s)]
*  Then started doing more research and finding out what was going on. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3681.16s)]
*  And then that was the collective freak out. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3684.2s)]
*  Well, it's incredible that so many people were injured and yet it's still kind of not [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3687.3999999999996s)]
*  widely disgusting. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3699.3199999999997s)]
*  I think people are discussing it. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3700.6s)]
*  More people are discussing it now, but it's still, there's a lot of people that don't [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3702.3599999999997s)]
*  want to bring it up because they don't want the heat. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3707.16s)]
*  They saw what happened to people that did bring it up and they don't want that coming [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3708.84s)]
*  their way. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3712.1200000000003s)]
*  It's still fresh in their memory and they keep their mouth shut. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3712.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3716.2000000000003s)]
*  But over time, did you find out what it was called? [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3716.76s)]
*  What biological warfare? [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3719.2400000000002s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3720.92s)]
*  No, no. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3721.7200000000003s)]
*  Is it term? [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3722.84s)]
*  It's a term for, huh? [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3723.4s)]
*  A term? [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3724.76s)]

*  Anyway, it doesn't matter. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3726.44s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3733.56s)]
*  But crazy times are fun too. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3735.32s)]
*  Because people snap out of it. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3737.5600000000004s)]
*  They pop through it. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3739.88s)]
*  They come out on the other side and they go, what the fuck was going on? [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3740.84s)]
*  And then you have a re-examining of society. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3744.1200000000003s)]
*  And I think that's happening right now. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3748.44s)]
*  And I think that's a good thing. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3750.28s)]
*  As long as people keep their cool and they don't go tribal. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3752.1200000000003s)]
*  You can't go tribal. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3754.84s)]
*  You can't go us versus them. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3756.28s)]
*  They're the bad guys. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3758.5200000000004s)]
*  The fucking, all those people with blue hair, those fucking pieces of shit. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3759.96s)]
*  No, they're sad, lost people. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3762.76s)]
*  That's what it is. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3765.4s)]
*  Sad, lost, angry people that think they have to lash out at the other for the problems [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3766.7599999999998s)]
*  that is really caused by gigantic corporations and the exchange of money. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3771.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3777.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3777.72s)]
*  It always comes down. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3778.2799999999997s)]
*  Hey, yeah, follow the money. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3779.48s)]
*  Follow that fucking cheese. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3781.16s)]
*  Every time. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3784.2799999999997s)]
*  It's always the money. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3785.56s)]
*  And it's never enough. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3787.64s)]
*  It's a weird thing about us. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3789.88s)]
*  And again, I think part of the problem is this lack of methods to escape. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3791.64s)]
*  And I don't mean escape reality. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3799.0s)]
*  I mean, to escape the fog, the fog of propaganda. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3800.44s)]
*  And that's, I mean, that's literally why all that stuff was made illegal in 1970. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3805.8799999999997s)]
*  Richard Nixon was trying to stop the anti-war effort in the civil rights movement. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3810.6s)]
*  That's why they turned the Schedule One, the sweeping Schedule One Prohibition Act [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3814.68s)]
*  of all psychedelic drugs. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3820.92s)]
*  That's what that was about. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3822.6800000000003s)]
*  It wasn't about protecting society. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3823.7200000000003s)]
*  If it was, they would have got rid of Oxycontin. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3825.4s)]
*  They would have got rid of addictive painkillers and Vicodin, Percocets. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3828.04s)]
*  They never got rid of any of that stuff. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3833.4s)]
*  They got rid of Big Macs for that matter. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3834.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3836.52s)]
*  See, here's the thing about Big Macs. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3837.88s)]
*  Oh, I know, listen, I know you're a meat guy. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3838.52s)]
*  You love meat. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3840.36s)]
*  But can we say Big Macs are not the greatest thing for you? [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3841.0s)]

*  It's like I say about Doritos. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3858.04s)]
*  People are like, oh, we should get Doritos off. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3859.3199999999997s)]

*  You know, some precipice after 21. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3891.4s)]

*  I became immoderate, you know? [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3897.88s)]
*  In fact, I didn't even smoke pot until I was 21. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3900.6000000000004s)]

*  I grew up with a lot of people that had drug problems. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3912.04s)]
*  And I wanted to succeed in life. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3915.16s)]

*  And now, what at point did you say to yourself, [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3930.52s)]

*  Well, I definitely think I'm very hypercritical, self-critical. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3947.0s)]
*  So, you know, I battle against that because I think that's something [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3952.9199999999996s)]
*  that anybody who strives to be successful battles against. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3956.7599999999998s)]
*  You always feel like you could do more, you know? [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3959.72s)]
*  But there's a balance. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3962.04s)]
*  Doing more and being happy, enjoying yourself, [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3963.64s)]

*  you know, having worthwhile goals, things that you think are valuable, [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3970.12s)]
*  not just to you, but valuable to other people. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3976.44s)]

*  Must feel pretty good about- [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3982.52s)]
*  I feel like that now. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3983.08s)]
*  Yeah, but I don't think about it, honestly, [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3984.84s)]
*  because I think if you think about it, then you get lost. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3986.68s)]
*  Then you get like, look how good I am. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3990.04s)]
*  You can get really lost in success or you get intoxicated by that too. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=3992.3599999999997s)]

*  You got to kind of exist and not feed your insecurities, [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4000.3599999999997s)]
*  but also don't feed any delusions of grandeur either. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4005.8799999999997s)]
*  Just be a person. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4010.92s)]
*  Just learn how to be a human being. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4012.52s)]
*  But that's got to be hard for you, dude, [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4015.0s)]
*  because I mean, you're at the tippy top of the tippy top. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4017.48s)]
*  And everybody's got to be kissing your ass and telling you how great you are. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4021.7999999999997s)]
*  It's got to be hard to not allow your ego to dictate things, you know? [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4026.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4032.8399999999997s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4034.04s)]
*  I stomp my ego pretty good. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4035.0s)]
*  I do it with workouts. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4038.2s)]
*  I do it with martial arts. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4039.56s)]
*  I do it with cold plunging and saunas. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4040.68s)]
*  I put myself through voluntary adversity. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4042.6s)]
*  That's pretty fucking brutal. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4044.8399999999997s)]
*  And that's my best way to achieve like homeostasis. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4046.44s)]
*  That's my best way to achieve like a balance. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4050.76s)]
*  Because I put myself through way more than life ever gives me. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4053.7200000000003s)]
*  So that I'm always, you know, I get it. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4059.1600000000003s)]
*  You know, you're always vulnerable. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4062.44s)]
*  You're always weak. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4063.88s)]
*  You're always late. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4064.6800000000003s)]
*  There's always something. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4066.44s)]
*  So as long as you confront that all the time, all the time, [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4067.7200000000003s)]
*  and keep your mind healthy and balanced, [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4071.96s)]
*  have a healthy perspective. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4075.6400000000003s)]
*  There's a lot of like new agey sort of bullshit terms [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4078.04s)]
*  that unfortunately have been co-opted by silly people. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4083.48s)]
*  But a lot of those like they're very important, like gratitude. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4088.92s)]
*  Gratitude is a really important quality that people should have. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4094.52s)]
*  Mindfulness is a really important quality that people should have. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4100.28s)]
*  But these things are co-opted by goofy people that wear wooden beads [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4104.44s)]
*  and want you to join their cult. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4108.599999999999s)]
*  They want you to think that they're special [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4112.2s)]
*  and they're particularly spiritual. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4113.799999999999s)]
*  And so unfortunately, really good concepts [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4116.2s)]
*  are often tainted by silly people. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4120.04s)]
*  Like love and God and a lot of the things [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4124.36s)]
*  that are really like beneficial to us as a society. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4127.5599999999995s)]
*  They get co-opted by goofy people. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4131.88s)]
*  Like how many people have been turned off by religion [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4134.68s)]
*  by watching mega pastors in these huge churches [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4136.92s)]
*  flying around in private jets and driving in Rolls Royces? [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4141.24s)]
*  Like, oh, well, this is all bullshit. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4143.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4147.400000000001s)]
*  I had a couple of jokes. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4152.36s)]
*  No. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4154.12s)]
*  Go ahead. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4154.62s)]
*  Do you think that, do you think, I mean, I'm curious. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4155.12s)]
*  I must know, I must have heard you talk about this, [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4160.44s)]
*  but what is your concept of religious? [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4163.56s)]
*  I mean, do you have a specific religion that you adhere to? [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4167.24s)]
*  Not necessarily. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4172.52s)]
*  I'm not in favor of any restrictive religions. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4175.56s)]
*  I'm not in favor of any religions that punish people that don't follow them. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4177.96s)]
*  And I'm not in favor of any religions that [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4183.32s)]
*  that force a very rigid structure on people that has to be adhered to, [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4186.2s)]
*  or you're a sinner or cast out. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4193.88s)]
*  I think that most religious experience, I think most religion is based on human beings, [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4199.88s)]
*  very unique experiences that have provided enlightenment. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4208.04s)]
*  And they're trying to express that enlightenment to other people. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4212.76s)]
*  And I think the problem with religious stories [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4217.24s)]
*  are that people are full of shit, and a lot of those stories suck. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4221.32s)]
*  A lot of those stories are probably distorted by the hand of man. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4225.32s)]
*  But I think, I'm of the school of thought that a lot of the religious experiences [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4229.56s)]
*  that people talk about were probably inspired by psychedelic experiences. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4234.2s)]
*  And there's a great book called The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross by John Marco Allegro. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4239.160000000001s)]
*  Do you know about that book? [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4244.120000000001s)]
*  I've heard of it, but I never read it. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4245.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4247.0s)]
*  It's a great book. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4247.400000000001s)]
*  I heard it's a great book. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4247.96s)]
*  It's very hard to follow because it's very, unless you understand Aramaic, [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4248.68s)]
*  unless you understand the translation of the Dead Sea Scrolls. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4253.320000000001s)]

*  Oh, really? [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4277.24s)]
*  No, I only speak only English. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4277.96s)]
*  Come on, Jay. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4280.36s)]
*  Well, the John Marco Allegro book, he was an ordained minister, [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4284.28s)]
*  but he was one of the people that was assigned to translate the Dead Sea Scrolls. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4288.84s)]
*  And he did it over the course of, I think it was about 14 years. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4292.04s)]
*  And then he wrote this book because it was his belief. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4294.92s)]
*  And he was a very straight-laced scholar. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4297.88s)]
*  He wasn't a psychedelic enthusiast, but he believed that the entire Christian religion [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4299.8s)]
*  was based on the consumption of psychedelic mushrooms and fertility rituals. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4305.4s)]
*  And he thinks that a lot of these stories, that their origins come from that. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4309.56s)]
*  Really? [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4314.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4315.48s)]
*  And he believed that a lot of it was the Ammonita muscaria mushroom, [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4315.88s)]
*  which is a very confusing mushroom because a lot of people have a hard time tripping on it. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4318.92s)]
*  They don't know exactly. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4322.84s)]
*  And Terrence McKenna believed that the problem was that it was... [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4324.12s)]
*  The psychedelic compounds in it varied regionally and genetically. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4330.4400000000005s)]
*  And that they weren't all the same. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4334.84s)]
*  And that a lot of these people that were having these experiences were not... [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4337.0s)]
*  It really depended upon where you get them from and how you got them [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4342.84s)]
*  and how you treated it. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4346.28s)]
*  And a lot of that information was lost. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4347.0s)]
*  And also, there's certain religious ceremonies that involved very mysterious things like soma. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4348.92s)]
*  Soma from the ancient Hindu texts. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4357.56s)]
*  They don't know what was in there. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4360.2s)]
*  They don't know what it was. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4361.8s)]
*  But it seems like it was some sort of a psychedelic compound, [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4362.92s)]
*  whether it was a blue lotus and psilocybin or a combination of many things. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4366.84s)]
*  Like the Alicinian mysteries where in ancient Greece, they believed that that was ergot, [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4372.4400000000005s)]
*  that ergot was mixed in with the wine. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4377.4s)]
*  Ergot, which is a very similar experience to LSD. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4379.16s)]
*  Oh. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4383.96s)]
*  Yeah. There's a great book on that too, if you've never read it. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4384.599999999999s)]
*  It's called The Immortality Key by a scholar named Brian Murorescu, [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4387.5599999999995s)]
*  who's a brilliant guy who's been on the podcast a couple of times. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4392.679999999999s)]
*  But he's done a lot of really legitimate work on proving that these vessels, [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4395.719999999999s)]
*  these wine containers that they had from these ancient times, [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4403.08s)]
*  they found trace elements of ergot in these wine vessels. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4407.0s)]
*  And they know that wine back then was not just fermented grapes. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4410.28s)]
*  They would add a bunch of things to the wine. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4413.96s)]
*  So party places. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4416.92s)]
*  Yeah. So these experiences that people would have, they would go to the [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4418.12s)]
*  Illysis and I went there when I was in Greece a couple of years ago. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4421.8s)]
*  And it's an amazing place, man. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4425.4s)]
*  When you're there, it feels weird. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4427.16s)]
*  When you go to the place where they had these psychedelic rituals, [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4429.8s)]
*  the place has a bizarre memory that you feel when you're there. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4432.28s)]
*  Because you can literally walk on the grounds where they had these rituals. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4437.8s)]
*  And you're there and you're like, whoa, this place feels wild. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4442.5199999999995s)]
*  It's just like, my parents, my kids, rather, were like, what's wrong? [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4447.0s)]
*  Like, I'm like, I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4451.16s)]
*  I'm just like, I'm weirded out by this place. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4452.92s)]
*  Like, I feel it. I feel like a bizarre connection with this place. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4455.24s)]
*  Like, it feels alive. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4458.759999999999s)]
*  Like, it's like it's humming or something. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4460.76s)]
*  It was very weird. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4462.52s)]
*  Very weird. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4464.2s)]
*  I was touching the rocks and just trying to like feel like what's going on here. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4464.92s)]
*  It's like you get thousands of years ago. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4468.92s)]
*  These people were just tripping balls and inventing democracy right here at this very spot. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4471.56s)]
*  You know, it's literally the roots of democracy. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4478.12s)]
*  They had to be tripping to think of something so bold as democracy. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4480.68s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, it is literally what we were talking about. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4484.52s)]
*  Like, if you want something that accentuates compassion and this sense of family and brotherhood [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4489.08s)]
*  and sisterhood that we're all together in this thing, what better than psychedelic drugs? [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4496.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4501.96s)]
*  And that's why they're illegal. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4502.44s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4505.08s)]
*  It gets in the way of this us versus them narrative that is so prevalent in our goofy society. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4506.36s)]
*  It's detached from these sacred compounds. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4514.2s)]
*  Yeah, the herb, you know, it really is a unifying thing. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4518.12s)]
*  I've always, from the first time I tried it, you know, I just felt such bond on me, you know. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4521.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4527.08s)]
*  Such compassion to everybody around me. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4527.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, makes you kinder. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4531.320000000001s)]
*  It makes you kinder. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4533.0s)]
*  Makes you kinder. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4534.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah. That's why they call it kind bud. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4535.320000000001s)]
*  Kind bud. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4537.8s)]
*  That's probably why they call it that. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4538.6s)]
*  I have a little of the kind bud. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4540.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, no, I like the image of it as just a unifier, you know. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4543.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4549.32s)]
*  And so that's what makes me wonder why does Texas not just say, hey, let's open the doors to this? [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4550.2s)]
*  It's not a bad thing. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4556.6s)]
*  You could have the best cafes in Austin. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4558.44s)]
*  I know. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4560.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4561.8s)]
*  Well, it's weird because there's certain weed here that's legal. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4562.44s)]
*  What is it? [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4566.36s)]
*  Delta 9? [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4566.76s)]
*  Is that the legal stuff or Delta 8? [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4567.5599999999995s)]
*  I know what you're talking about. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4569.0s)]
*  It's weird. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4570.28s)]
*  It's weird because it's like pretty much just weed. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4571.4s)]
*  Yeah, I never got into that stuff though. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4574.44s)]
*  It's just a different version of the plant. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4577.16s)]
*  But it doesn't get you high. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4579.4s)]
*  Oh, yeah, it does. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4580.92s)]
*  Really? [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4581.799999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4582.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4584.28s)]
*  I'll get you some. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4585.48s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4586.84s)]
*  I don't know what they're doing. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4589.08s)]
*  I don't know what they're doing. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4589.96s)]
*  I don't know how they're doing it, but somehow or another they're skirting around the rules [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4594.599999999999s)]
*  and developing something that is basically the same. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4599.64s)]
*  I'll get over to the Delta 9 Center. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4602.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's basically like weed's twin sister that has different genetics. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4604.68s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4609.24s)]
*  I don't understand it. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4610.04s)]
*  Now, I heard they're trying to work out a thing where there's no more of those exceptions here. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4611.16s)]
*  Oh, well, that would suck. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4617.88s)]
*  The legislature. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4619.48s)]
*  That's goofy. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4620.84s)]
*  I mean, there's plenty of things to concentrate on. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4621.96s)]
*  Why concentrate on that? [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4623.88s)]
*  It's just a dumb rule. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4625.56s)]
*  It's a dumb rule that's mostly enforced by people who don't know what the experience is. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4627.96s)]
*  They have a distorted idea what the experience is, and they think it's just going to make people losers. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4634.2s)]
*  Well, also, it's being mandated from people with different kinds of desires, and a lot of it financial. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4638.6s)]
*  You know, I consider a crime anything I do that hurts you or your property. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4651.88s)]
*  Otherwise, there's no crime. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4657.16s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4658.76s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4660.5199999999995s)]
*  And I think we've got to get past that. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4661.24s)]
*  I think there's just a lot of people that recognize that what they did in the 1970s was very effective. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4663.48s)]
*  They threw water on the entire psychedelic movement and the civil rights movement and the anti-war movement. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4669.8s)]
*  And they did it by banning a lot of these compounds that were changed in the way people thought about life. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4677.88s)]
*  And the whole peace, love, and hippie movement of the 1960s was all inspired by psychedelic drugs, all of it. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4683.88s)]
*  And it was a revolutionary, complete change of society from 1950 to 1960. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4691.4s)]
*  I mean, 10 years, things became, the music and culture became almost unrecognizable. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4697.8s)]
*  It could change so radically. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4703.0s)]
*  And I think it was terrifying to the powers that be. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4705.0s)]
*  And unfortunately, the propaganda that they pushed, just like the propaganda that we saw during the COVID times and propaganda that you have whenever there's a war, that propaganda is sticky. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4707.72s)]
*  That stuff sticks. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4718.92s)]
*  It sticks around for a long time. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4720.4400000000005s)]
*  And unless you have viable representations of opposing narratives that are really effective, it's very hard for people to change their perspective on things without a personal experience. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4722.6s)]
*  Right. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4736.360000000001s)]
*  And most of these people that are like, you know, straight-laced, you know, no-nonsense type folks, they don't want to smoke weed. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4736.84s)]
*  They don't want to ruin my brain. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4742.84s)]
*  I've heard legitimate scientists say, I would never want to interfere with the way my brain works. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4744.84s)]
*  Okay, do you drink coffee? [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4750.84s)]
*  Shut the fuck up. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4752.04s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4753.16s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4754.2s)]

*  Do you eat good food? [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4757.56s)]
*  There's a lot of things that change the way your brain works. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4758.6s)]
*  This is a dumb way to look. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4761.24s)]
*  You really want your doctor looking healthy. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4763.400000000001s)]
*  You don't want to walk in and see some obese, you know, having heart trouble breathing type of guy. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4765.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4772.6s)]
*  You know, it's going to give you your advice. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4772.76s)]
*  Well, that was one of the most fascinating things about COVID. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4775.8s)]
*  When I was talking to Dr. Peter Hotez, who's an overweight guy who eats junk food, and he's telling me everybody's got to get vaccinated. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4777.72s)]
*  I'm like, are you healthy? [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4783.88s)]
*  Like, are you healthy? [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4788.04s)]
*  Because you don't see, do you work out? [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4789.400000000001s)]
*  Like, do you eat well? [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4791.0s)]
*  Do you take vitamins? [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4791.8s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4792.68s)]
*  None of those things. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4795.0s)]
*  But you think that like chemicals, that the only way that you're going to get healthy is from a laboratory and an injection. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4795.719999999999s)]
*  That doesn't seem real. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4806.44s)]
*  That seems crazy. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4807.5599999999995s)]
*  Well, the whole notion is to bolster your immune system's response to this specific item, right? [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4808.44s)]
*  But so if your immune system's strong, you really have nothing to fear. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4814.44s)]
*  Well, that's when- [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4820.04s)]
*  If your immune system's weak, you have also a lot to fear by taking a vaccine that can, with this recent one, it actually hurts the immune system. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4820.84s)]
*  It harms the immune system. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4833.400000000001s)]
*  Especially with repeated doses. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4835.08s)]
*  Well, at least old people should get vaccinated. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4836.200000000001s)]
*  Should old people get vaccinated? [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4837.64s)]
*  I don't think so. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4839.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the problem was also any sort of, I mean, this is Dr. Birx is now admitting this when she's being questioned, [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4840.68s)]
*  is that they stopped any early treatments that weren't the vaccine and that they probably shouldn't have done that. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4849.64s)]
*  And that a lot of people could have been saved because of that. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4857.72s)]
*  And that's true. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4860.12s)]
*  And then that's something that people need to, that's one of the best aspects of Bobby's book, Bobby Kennedy's book, The Real Anthony Fauci, [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4861.0s)]
*  is understand what pressures were put on these organizations to stifle and completely stop the prescription use of a bunch of different things. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4869.24s)]
*  Hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, also the studies that were done on vitamin D deficiencies and how that impacted immune systems and just sunlight, exercise, diet. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4882.2s)]
*  All those things play a critical factor in how well your immune system functions. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4893.639999999999s)]
*  The idea that the only way your immune system functions at its peak is you got to stick a fucking metal pin filled with a solution that gets plunged into your tissue. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4897.24s)]
*  That's the only way. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4907.16s)]
*  It's the only way, Woody. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4908.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4909.719999999999s)]
*  You got to shove a fucking needle in your arm. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4910.2s)]
*  Like, what? [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4913.24s)]
*  But you make a great point because it's like, you know, why didn't we hear from America's Dr. Fauci or the other representatives in the medical industry, [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4914.04s)]
*  maybe eat less sugar, maybe eat less fast food, maybe exercise. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4923.88s)]
*  There was no other directive. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4932.04s)]
*  No. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4934.2s)]
*  Take the vaccine. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4934.4400000000005s)]
*  No. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4936.12s)]
*  It's the only directive. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4936.36s)]
*  They didn't want a fat shame, so they never told anybody to lose weight, which is one of the major comorbidities that affected people negatively. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4937.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4945.400000000001s)]
*  Bill Maher was on to that really early. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4946.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4948.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4948.76s)]
*  That's a good point. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4949.4800000000005s)]
*  Weird, weird times. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4950.92s)]
*  But again, I have hope. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4953.16s)]
*  Yeah, me too, man. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4955.64s)]
*  In spite of everything, I have hope. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4956.92s)]
*  Because I believe in people generally. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4959.72s)]
*  I do too. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4961.64s)]

*  Greatest, kindest, nicest people. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4974.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4977.4800000000005s)]
*  But you may not want to talk about certain subjects. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4978.6s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4982.68s)]
*  So yeah, just avoid those subjects. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4985.400000000001s)]
*  You get along. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4988.92s)]
*  And even the subjects that you're supposed to avoid, why? [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4991.4800000000005s)]
*  Why are we avoiding them? [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4994.76s)]
*  Well, I agree. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4995.96s)]
*  I'd like to talk about any subject. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4997.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=4999.16s)]
*  I like a little healthy debate. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5000.52s)]
*  Also, I want to know why you think the way you think. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5004.52s)]
*  If you think totally different than me, I want to sit down with you. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5006.68s)]
*  And I want to give you all the room in the world to say what you think. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5009.8s)]
*  I want to know how you came to those conclusions. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5015.320000000001s)]
*  I want to know what your childhood was like. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5017.8s)]
*  I want to know what experiences have you had that led you to have these concrete evaluations [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5019.8s)]
*  of the way society is that are so different than mine. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5027.160000000001s)]
*  That's a great compassionate vantage point. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5030.04s)]
*  That's what we really lacked. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5032.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5034.6s)]
*  We need that. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5035.56s)]
*  You need to sit down with people that you don't agree with and find out. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5037.0s)]
*  And oftentimes, they fall apart. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5040.6s)]
*  That's the fascinating thing. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5042.76s)]
*  You give them enough room. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5044.4400000000005s)]
*  You just keep talking to them. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5045.96s)]
*  They fall apart. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5047.080000000001s)]
*  One of the weirdest conversations I had on this podcast was talking to Dr. Sanjay Gupta from CNN. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5049.160000000001s)]
*  They sent him over here to fucking straighten me out. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5054.280000000001s)]
*  And by the end of it, it was a very bizarre conversation. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5056.84s)]
*  By the end of it, he was essentially agreeing with me. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5061.080000000001s)]
*  I had heard that he didn't think you should necessarily vaccinate. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5062.92s)]
*  I thought he was a little more progressive on that. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5068.4400000000005s)]
*  He's smart, but he's also working for CNN. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5071.16s)]
*  And he's also a neurosurgeon. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5074.6s)]
*  So he's a bright guy. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5076.84s)]
*  He's just captured by the system. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5079.8s)]
*  And that's part of the problem. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5082.04s)]
*  But there was a lot of things that didn't make any sense. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5083.56s)]
*  One of the ones where he wanted me to get vaccinated after I'd recovered from COVID. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5085.400000000001s)]
*  I'm like, dude, I had COVID for... [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5089.0s)]
*  Shouldn't that be the reason I'm already vaccinated, basically? [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5090.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5094.12s)]
*  Well, I'd recovered from COVID in three days. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5094.76s)]
*  It wasn't hard at all. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5096.52s)]
*  And that's when I got hit. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5097.88s)]
*  That's when everybody came after me. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5098.92s)]
*  It was because I was a bad example, because I was healthy. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5100.12s)]
*  And I was giving people bad information by telling them all the things that I took to get better, [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5103.56s)]
*  which is really weird. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5108.76s)]
*  And then they focused on this one thing, which was ivermectin. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5109.8s)]
*  I read a laundry list of stuff that I took. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5113.320000000001s)]
*  IV vitamins, NAD, ivermectin, monoclonal antibodies. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5116.6s)]
*  I talked about all the different stuff that my doctor put me on. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5122.280000000001s)]
*  And I was better in three days. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5125.0s)]
*  And then what did CNN do? [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5126.6s)]
*  They turned my face yellow. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5128.120000000001s)]
*  They put a filter on the video to make me look sick. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5129.96s)]
*  And they started talking about me taking horse paste, which is crazy. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5133.64s)]
*  They said I was taking a veterinary medicine. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5138.040000000001s)]
*  Yeah, the ivermectin? [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5140.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5142.4400000000005s)]
*  They suddenly calling it that in spite of it treating millions of humans. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5143.58s)]
*  Millions. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5148.7s)]
*  Billions of prescriptions have been filled. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5149.58s)]
*  Billions. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5152.379999999999s)]
*  Billions of times human beings have taken ivermectin. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5153.259999999999s)]
*  They have the guy who invented it in the statue at the WHO. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5155.58s)]
*  I mean, that's why, because he invented ivermectin. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5159.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5162.139999999999s)]
*  He won the Nobel Prize. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5162.7s)]
*  That was an interesting thing, how they made these other drugs negative. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5163.74s)]
*  What was it? [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5170.86s)]
*  Hydroxychloroquine. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5172.22s)]
*  Hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin, which some legitimate doctors found to be effective. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5173.02s)]
*  Suddenly you can't even bring it up. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5181.34s)]
*  And then you couldn't even get it. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5183.58s)]
*  Suddenly they made it ungettable. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5186.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5188.14s)]
*  Well, you couldn't get it from Walgreens. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5188.38s)]
*  They wouldn't prescribe it for you unless you had some sort of a... [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5190.9400000000005s)]
*  Malaria or something. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5194.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5196.54s)]
*  You'd have to have or some sort of a parasite. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5196.78s)]
*  That's why they said it was a dewormer because it was anti-parasitic. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5199.74s)]
*  But when I said it's a Sanjay Gupta, I go, but yes, but it's also been shown to stop [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5203.0199999999995s)]
*  viral replication in vitro. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5207.9s)]
*  I said, you know that, right? [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5210.219999999999s)]
*  And you can see this, this look on his face like, oh, shit. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5211.82s)]
*  Because that's a fact. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5215.5s)]
*  They've studied viral replication. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5217.34s)]
*  You use ivermectin in Petri dishes. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5220.219999999999s)]
*  It stops viral replication. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5222.86s)]
*  It's a fact. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5224.94s)]
*  There's studies on this. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5227.26s)]
*  Also, it's like one of the most safe drugs known to man. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5229.1s)]
*  It's like the safety profile is incredible. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5232.54s)]
*  And this idea that like Rolling Stones printing articles that people are having overdoses [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5235.26s)]
*  from ivermectin and people can't get into the emergency room because of gunshot wounds. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5240.3s)]
*  They even showed a photograph of a bunch of people outside of an emergency room [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5244.700000000001s)]
*  wearing winter coats in August because it was a photograph of people waiting in line [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5249.900000000001s)]
*  to get a flu shot. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5253.820000000001s)]
*  It was a bullshit photograph that fucking Rolling Stone published. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5255.0199999999995s)]
*  This is so wild to watch because it's not just propaganda. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5259.419999999999s)]
*  It's really shitty propaganda because there's not much truthful they can say that would [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5263.339999999999s)]
*  go against this stuff. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5268.46s)]
*  So they have to just say it's horse dewormer. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5269.98s)]
*  You're a fool. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5272.62s)]
*  You're taking horse dewormer. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5273.58s)]
*  But what they didn't understand is at the time, they didn't understand the media landscape. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5276.139999999999s)]
*  They thought they were still huge, but they didn't understand like an average video on [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5284.46s)]
*  my show was like 10 times bigger than their show. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5289.5s)]
*  It's just we weren't talking about it. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5292.46s)]
*  We weren't saying it. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5294.06s)]
*  So they still thought they were CNN. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5295.42s)]
*  They were going to crush this rebellion against this one specific thing that you had to do, [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5297.26s)]
*  which was get vaccinated. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5303.1s)]
*  Remember when Biden was on television, he was talking about the hurricane was coming. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5306.86s)]
*  Most important thing when the hurricane is coming is get vaccinated. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5312.94s)]
*  Everything's harder if you're not vaccinated. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5317.259999999999s)]
*  All that money they gave those guys, they gave them a lot of money. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5323.9s)]
*  They had to do something to pay back. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5327.58s)]
*  It's wild though. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5330.62s)]
*  It's going to affect their ability to make money in the future. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5332.0599999999995s)]
*  That's for sure. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5333.98s)]
*  Especially CNN. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5334.94s)]
*  Yeah, they all take a hit. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5337.179999999999s)]
*  Honestly, I won't miss these other organizations anymore. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5339.1s)]
*  I watch them every now and then. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5343.42s)]
*  They lost my confidence. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5344.860000000001s)]
*  Yours and most people's. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5348.700000000001s)]
*  I think that's good. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5350.780000000001s)]
*  I do. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5352.780000000001s)]
*  I think that's just it's healthy. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5353.42s)]
*  That's the human mental immune system weeding out pathogens. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5356.22s)]
*  That's true. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5363.740000000001s)]
*  The media you take in can certainly be a pathogen. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5364.46s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5367.820000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of cool shit out there. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5370.06s)]
*  It's like you can concentrate on that or you can concentrate on how much cool music there is now, [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5372.46s)]
*  how much great comedy there is now, how many great movies there are now. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5376.46s)]
*  There's plenty of things to concentrate on. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5379.58s)]
*  The problem is there's a lot of people, their business is division. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5383.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5388.14s)]
*  What's that song? [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5391.34s)]
*  Politics and religion causing more division. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5395.1s)]
*  But it's really government and media causing more division. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5398.7s)]
*  It's really money. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5403.98s)]
*  If there was no money in politics and there was no money in pharmaceutical drugs and there's [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5405.0199999999995s)]
*  no money in war, we'd live in a much better place. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5409.339999999999s)]
*  Your lips to God's ears on that. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5414.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5415.74s)]
*  We have to move closer to that somehow or another. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5417.339999999999s)]
*  And whether Bobby Kennedy can help us along those lines and all these other people that [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5420.54s)]
*  are trying very hard to stomp out a lot of this bullshit that we've been experiencing for so long, [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5425.42s)]
*  hopefully. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5431.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5432.78s)]
*  Bobby, I really hope he's able to do some good things because he's certainly a man on a mission [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5434.22s)]
*  and a man who cares deeply. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5440.54s)]
*  And I think really heroic how much he stood up for [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5444.78s)]
*  things that he didn't need to talk about, that didn't help him in any way. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5450.62s)]
*  He just took one arrow after the other over it. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5456.14s)]
*  And to me, even if he was wrong, which I don't think he was, then it's heroic to do that. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5460.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5466.62s)]
*  Yeah. And he wasn't wrong. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5467.66s)]
*  The thing is, I was a victim of that propaganda. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5469.02s)]
*  And I told him that when I met him and I had him on the show. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5473.1s)]
*  I said, I always thought you were a kook. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5475.02s)]
*  I had always heard, I'd bought into it. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5476.86s)]
*  I just had this sort of cursory examination of what people were saying about you. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5478.9400000000005s)]
*  Like, oh, that guy doesn't believe in vaccines. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5482.46s)]
*  He's a nut. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5484.38s)]
*  He's some sort of an anti-science nut. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5485.18s)]
*  It was just a conspiracy theorist. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5487.900000000001s)]
*  He's just like all these other nutty people. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5489.66s)]
*  Right. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5491.820000000001s)]
*  And then I read his book and I was like, okay, well, this book is real. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5492.38s)]
*  Why isn't he getting sued if it's not real? [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5495.900000000001s)]
*  If it's not real, why is he getting sued? [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5498.9400000000005s)]
*  Why? [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5500.38s)]
*  If all these things he's saying about Anthony Fauci during the AIDS crisis, [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5500.9400000000005s)]
*  if that's not true, why is he not getting sued? [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5503.900000000001s)]
*  I would sue the fuck out of him if he lied about me and said I was [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5506.3s)]
*  vaccinating foster kids with experimental drugs that were killing them. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5509.26s)]
*  I would sue you if that was not true. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5513.5s)]
*  Like, hey, you fucking liar. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5515.98s)]
*  I never did that. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5517.179999999999s)]
*  This is a lie. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5518.0599999999995s)]
*  You can't prove it. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5519.099999999999s)]
*  But it's not a lie. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5519.74s)]
*  If it was a lie, he'd get sued. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5522.38s)]
*  If it being truth, they just ignored it. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5524.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5527.179999999999s)]
*  But man, that is a heavy tome. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5527.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5531.42s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5531.9s)]
*  There's some info in there. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5533.0199999999995s)]
*  Just blew my mind. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5534.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5536.219999999999s)]
*  Like the way Fauci was able to get these principal investigators from like all these [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5536.62s)]
*  respectable colleges and put them on these committees that ended up saying, [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5542.54s)]
*  yeah, this is the vaccine we'll use. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5547.5s)]
*  This is the we'll use AZT. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5549.5s)]
*  He started with the AZT thing. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5552.22s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5553.98s)]
*  And AZT was known to be a highly toxic, really ineffective drug. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5554.86s)]
*  And of course, but that was the one they picked. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5561.34s)]
*  And so they started using that again. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5565.18s)]
*  And I don't know how many people that killed. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5567.34s)]
*  That killed friends of mine. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5569.1s)]
*  AZT was very toxic and they finally had to yank it. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5571.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5575.18s)]
*  And now they use different chemical cocktails. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5575.74s)]
*  But like Fauci did some extraordinarily evil shit. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5578.3s)]
*  And he knows what he did. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5584.9400000000005s)]
*  He was the villain of the Dallas Buyers Club, that movie. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5586.54s)]
*  That was about people trying to seek alternative treatments to deal with AIDS. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5589.74s)]
*  Oh, right. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5595.1s)]
*  Right. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5595.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5596.14s)]
*  That's Fauci. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5596.62s)]
*  Right. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5597.18s)]
*  Right. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5597.42s)]
*  Right. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5597.58s)]
*  That's AZT. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5597.900000000001s)]
*  Magic Johnson got on AZT and it was killing him and he got off of it. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5599.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5603.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5604.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5605.26s)]
*  And he's still alive. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5605.42s)]
*  And he's still alive. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5606.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5607.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5608.3s)]
*  It's a bummer. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5608.54s)]
*  It's just a bummer that someone had that kind of power for so long. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5611.42s)]
*  It was such a fucking monster. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5614.0599999999995s)]
*  Did you see that little meme that went around? [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5618.7s)]
*  It was right after he got up. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5621.98s)]
*  First time anyone ever got pre-pardoned. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5624.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5627.42s)]
*  And you said, nothing says trust science like a blanket pre-pardon. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5627.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5634.0599999999995s)]
*  Picture Fauci. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5634.38s)]
*  Well, the problem with that pre-pardon is he's pre-pardoned federally, [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5635.9s)]
*  but he's not pre-pardoned statewide. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5639.099999999999s)]
*  These states can still sue him. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5640.86s)]
*  Not only that, when you're pardoned, then you can no longer plead the fifth. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5642.62s)]
*  So you could be held for perjury. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5648.62s)]
*  So there's a lot of issues with being pardoned. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5651.099999999999s)]
*  I don't think Biden took into consideration or Fauci took into consideration either. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5655.5s)]
*  I think he just wanted anything to protect him because he knew it was coming. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5660.7s)]
*  He knew that just the emails that were available that showed collusion, [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5664.22s)]
*  he had gotten a hold of all these different researchers and changed their perspective [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5669.34s)]
*  on whether or not it was a lab leak because through EcoHealth Alliance, [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5673.66s)]
*  they had funded gain-of-function research after Obama had- [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5677.34s)]
*  Gain-of-function. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5680.3s)]
*  That's what I was trying to think. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5681.9s)]
*  Oh, that's what you were talking about. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5683.74s)]
*  But gain-of-function is essentially taking a virus and making it more infectious to human beings. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5684.94s)]
*  Weaponizing the virus. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5690.299999999999s)]
*  The idea is supposedly to study it, but if you're studying it and you don't have a fucking cure, [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5692.7s)]
*  you've been studying this shit for so long and you don't have a cure, [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5697.58s)]
*  what are you actually doing? [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5700.54s)]
*  Well, you're doing weapons research. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5701.82s)]
*  This is one of the things that Bobby's talked about with Lyme disease, [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5704.379999999999s)]
*  or they tried to get him on Lyme disease, which is a very funny grilling. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5707.58s)]
*  Did you say that Lyme disease was a leaked bio weapon? [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5712.3s)]
*  He goes, I probably did. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5716.78s)]
*  He did. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5720.54s)]
*  Plum Island, they were fucking researching whether or not they could infect bugs, [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5721.34s)]
*  fleas and ticks, and then dump them on populations to overwhelm their medical system [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5726.38s)]
*  and they use it as a bio weapon so we can invade easier. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5731.18s)]
*  Yeah, they did that. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5734.14s)]
*  With the masters of war. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5735.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5737.5s)]
*  But yeah, that's a funny way. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5738.22s)]
*  Good impersonation, by the way. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5739.9800000000005s)]
*  It's not hard, unfortunately. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5741.9800000000005s)]
*  Poor Bobby. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5744.700000000001s)]
*  I mean, if really science wanted to come fix his fucking voice, man, [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5745.740000000001s)]
*  if that guy had his old voice, he'd be a lot more powerful. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5749.5s)]
*  It's like people dismiss him because his voice is hard. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5752.38s)]
*  It's hard to listen to sometimes. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5755.5s)]
*  Yeah, and that condition he has, you would think there'd be some way to address it, [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5757.02s)]
*  but I don't know. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5761.02s)]
*  Well, he believes that condition came from the flu vaccine. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5762.14s)]
*  Oh. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5765.419999999999s)]
*  It's a side effect of flu vaccines. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5766.62s)]
*  He used to take a flu vaccine every year. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5768.94s)]
*  And so he developed this voice problem and he believes it's a vaccine injury, [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5770.86s)]
*  which is very ironic. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5777.259999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5779.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5779.9s)]
*  Didn't know that. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5781.419999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5782.379999999999s)]
*  Yeah, those fucking things don't work either. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5783.74s)]
*  Those things, and he's talked about that, like even if it protects you from that one flu, [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5786.139999999999s)]
*  it makes you many more times more likely to catch other things. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5790.94s)]
*  You were fucking around with complex systems inside human bodies with pharmaceutical drugs [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5794.700000000001s)]
*  that have been, the way they've studied them is filled with shenanigans. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5800.860000000001s)]
*  They might do 10 studies and one of them shows effectiveness because they've rigged the study [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5807.1s)]
*  in a certain way. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5812.46s)]
*  And then they like, he explained to me that the reason why they could say it's 100% effective [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5813.58s)]
*  was because one person got it in the vaccine trial and two people got it in the placebo. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5819.66s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5827.58s)]
*  That's 100%. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5828.46s)]
*  100% better. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5829.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5831.42s)]
*  One is 100% better than two. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5832.46s)]
*  Like what? [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5833.98s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5835.74s)]
*  No, that's not 100% means nobody gets infected, you fucking assholes. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5836.7s)]
*  That should be a law. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5841.34s)]
*  That should be a crime to explain things like that. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5843.26s)]
*  I had this guy on who was, he litigated against pharmaceutical drug companies, [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5845.98s)]
*  particularly against Vioxx when they released this anti-inflammatory medication, Vioxx, [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5852.219999999999s)]
*  and some 50 to 60,000 people died from it. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5857.259999999999s)]
*  A friend of mine got a stroke from Vioxx. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5861.0199999999995s)]
*  This guy was saying that when, like when you hear peer-reviewed studies, [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5863.74s)]

*  they don't even give the peer reviewers the raw data. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5875.18s)]
*  They give the peer reviewers the data as it's been interpreted by the scientists who work [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5879.26s)]
*  for the pharmaceutical drug companies. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5884.54s)]
*  So they review it and then they give their version of it to these other scientists who [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5886.62s)]
*  are already on the payroll. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5892.14s)]
*  They're all NIH funded. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5893.740000000001s)]
*  Everybody's together. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5895.5s)]
*  Everybody's all in the loop. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5896.54s)]
*  Everybody's dependent upon whether or not they're going to receive grants and funding. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5897.66s)]
*  It's all based on Fauci. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5901.66s)]
*  And that's how you find out whether or not something is good or bad. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5903.9800000000005s)]

*  And when he was explaining, I'm like, that can't be real. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5908.540000000001s)]
*  Then he's explaining to us, showing us how it works. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5911.1s)]
*  It's corrupt. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5914.38s)]
*  It's fully, completely, totally corrupt. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5915.42s)]
*  And if anything Bobby can do, it's make sure that we have valid studies, [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5917.660000000001s)]

*  Let's find out what the fuck is really good for you. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5933.26s)]
*  Because it's not like all pharmaceutical drugs are bad. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5935.34s)]
*  A lot of pharmaceutical drugs have helped people, saved people's lives, [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5937.900000000001s)]

*  What's real and what's bad? [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5946.9400000000005s)]
*  And why are you profiting off of shit that's killing people? [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5948.14s)]
*  That shouldn't be so hard, Woody. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5952.38s)]

*  Why would you? [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5958.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well, just headache in your life. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5959.5s)]

*  You know what I mean? [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5974.06s)]
*  Not getting up till maybe noon. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5975.580000000001s)]
*  You can't have that if you were president. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5977.900000000001s)]
*  No. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5979.900000000001s)]
*  You don't get one day like that. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5980.38s)]
*  No, unless you're Biden. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5982.22s)]
*  I think he slept a lot. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5983.34s)]
*  He wasn't really the president. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5985.1s)]
*  Yeah, that's what's really wild. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5989.1s)]
*  I don't know, man. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5990.38s)]
*  Like I said, I'm encouraged. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5991.66s)]
*  And I also think things are going to get really weird with AI. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5993.42s)]
*  I think with AI, and especially when AI gets attached to quantum computing, [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=5996.9400000000005s)]
*  we're going to have an undeniable access to truth. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6002.62s)]
*  That's going to be very disconcerting to a lot of people. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6007.9800000000005s)]
*  We're going to have an understanding of the reality of the world that we live in. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6011.66s)]
*  That's going to be very undeniable. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6016.38s)]
*  It's going to be strange. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6019.099999999999s)]
*  And unfortunately, there's going to be a lot of propaganda with that too, [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6021.099999999999s)]
*  because a lot of AI is programmed by people. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6024.3s)]
*  So there'll be a battle of which AI is the most trusted and effective. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6027.0199999999995s)]
*  And then the real fear is that AI governs us, which is probably going to happen. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6033.9s)]
*  We're probably going to be getting more effective. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6039.58s)]
*  Couldn't do any worse. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6041.82s)]
*  No. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6042.62s)]
*  The government so far has really been subpar. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6043.099999999999s)]
*  Really been subpar. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6047.339999999999s)]
*  I don't look at individual presidents, because I just look at like overall, [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6050.219999999999s)]
*  the presidents have to bow down and kiss the ring, no matter who it is. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6054.46s)]
*  So you're not getting in there. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6058.299999999999s)]
*  The last guy who didn't was probably John Kennedy. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6061.099999999999s)]
*  But certainly even a guy like Carter, who I love, I consider the best. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6065.9s)]
*  Everybody has to kiss the ring. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6072.139999999999s)]
*  He didn't kiss it enough. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6075.0199999999995s)]
*  That's why they got rid of him. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6076.14s)]
*  You know what he did? [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6078.46s)]
*  He levied a windfall profits tax on the oil companies because they were gouging. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6080.62s)]
*  They were making so much profit, right? [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6086.62s)]
*  Which happens all the time, whether it be the oil companies or the vaccine companies, whatever. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6089.34s)]
*  These insane profits that are just, they create some fear and then boom. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6095.900000000001s)]
*  They make a lot of money. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6103.26s)]
*  And so, but he was bold enough to lay this tax on them for their profit. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6104.7s)]
*  And that's what killed him. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6110.9400000000005s)]
*  He was, there was no way he was getting another term after that. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6112.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6116.22s)]
*  And then it was after that, that Oliver North was vital in helping to [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6118.06s)]
*  kill that rescue attempt with the helicopter. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6123.1s)]
*  And also the Contras versus the Sandinistas, the selling crack in Los Angeles in order to [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6127.900000000001s)]
*  fund all that shit. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6134.14s)]
*  All that stuff was going on at the same time. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6135.42s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6137.26s)]
*  I totally believe that. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6137.9800000000005s)]
*  Oh, it's fact. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6139.5s)]
*  I had a freeway Ricky Ross, the guy who went to jail for it on the podcast a few times. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6140.46s)]

*  Didn't he shoot himself in the head twice? [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6161.42s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6163.74s)]

*  Yeah, a little bit. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6169.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6172.299999999999s)]
*  He was one of the main whistleblowers about that. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6172.78s)]
*  Yeah, there's, it's a sordid, horrible history. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6175.9s)]
*  But freeway Ricky Ross was unbeknownst to him, was selling cocaine, funding this war. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6180.219999999999s)]

*  you know, corrupt DAs, corrupt prosecutors, corrupt judges. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6355.02s)]
*  It's like, you know, it's all over the place. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6358.86s)]
*  One of the guys that Biden pardoned was one of the people that was involved in that [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6361.58s)]
*  Kids for Cash where they were putting kids in detention centers just for profit. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6365.42s)]
*  Oh. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6372.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6373.58s)]

*  I'm not. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6375.5s)]
*  No, I don't know. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6375.98s)]
*  There was a judge. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6376.38s)]
*  Was it Pennsylvania? [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6377.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6378.7s)]
*  There was a judge in Pennsylvania that was making millions of dollars through [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6379.179999999999s)]
*  putting kids in detention centers. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6385.099999999999s)]
*  And ruining kids lives, causing suicides, deaths, [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6388.38s)]
*  downward spiral of their life, like wrongfully detaining them and doing it for profit. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6392.9400000000005s)]
*  How is he getting a kickback? [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6398.86s)]
*  He's getting kickbacks. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6399.9800000000005s)]
*  Getting kickbacks from private prisons. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6401.02s)]
*  Oh, from private prisons? [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6403.02s)]
*  Yeah, from private prisons, from prosecutors, from, I mean, I don't know exactly who was funding it, [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6404.22s)]
*  but he was convicted and he's one of the guys Biden pardoned. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6409.34s)]
*  Really? [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6414.22s)]
*  It's sick. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6417.18s)]
*  Biden pardoned like 8,000 people. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6418.62s)]
*  Did he? [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6421.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6421.66s)]
*  He pardoned more people than anybody, which generally I'm a fan of pardoning people. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6422.3s)]
*  I think most people are incarcerated for far too long. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6426.9400000000005s)]
*  I don't think it rehabilitates people. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6429.900000000001s)]
*  I think it probably makes them more hardened criminals in most of the cases, [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6432.06s)]
*  is a few cases where people decide to take a better path in jail and educate themselves [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6435.34s)]
*  and learn and come out a better person. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6440.62s)]
*  And I've met a lot of those people. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6442.46s)]
*  And unfortunately, I've met a lot of those people from Josh Dubin that were wrongly incarcerated [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6443.900000000001s)]
*  and then came out these amazing, incredibly intelligent, really well read, interesting [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6447.74s)]
*  people because they dedicated themselves to doing that while they were in jail. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6452.62s)]
*  Because they realized like, I did not commit this crime. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6455.82s)]
*  I'm forced into this situation. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6457.9s)]
*  What can I do to make better of my life while I'm here? [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6460.139999999999s)]
*  Well, I'm going to educate myself and I'm going to come out a better person. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6462.7s)]
*  That's great. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6466.219999999999s)]
*  By the way, I wouldn't mind a pre-pardon. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6467.9s)]
*  You do whatever you want. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6471.74s)]
*  I got a pre-pardon, dude. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6474.78s)]
*  There's a lot of people that got pre-pardons. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6476.06s)]
*  They're like, how did Adam Schiff get a pre-pardon? [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6477.820000000001s)]
*  Why is Liz Cheney got a pre-pardon? [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6479.900000000001s)]
*  What did you do? [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6481.5s)]
*  What did you do that you need a pardon? [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6483.820000000001s)]
*  But also how it that's never happened before. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6485.18s)]
*  There's never been a pre-pardon. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6488.54s)]
*  How can you pardon someone if they haven't been convicted of something? [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6491.18s)]
*  Well, there's a lot of debate on the constitutionality of it, too. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6494.38s)]
*  Like whether or not that's even what the pardons were intended for. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6496.860000000001s)]
*  And that was the thing during the 2020, like when Trump was leaving the office, [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6499.9800000000005s)]
*  there was talk about what if he pre-pardons his family? [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6505.66s)]
*  That would be outrageous. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6508.139999999999s)]
*  And all the Democrats were against it. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6509.259999999999s)]
*  And then, of course, when Biden did it, everybody just shut up. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6510.86s)]
*  He pre-pardoned his son from 2014 or something, 11? [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6515.5s)]
*  I don't forget Nixon in a pre-pardon. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6519.82s)]
*  Oh, what a good guy. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6521.9s)]
*  Yeah, that was necessary. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6525.9s)]
*  That was a pre-pardon? [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6530.38s)]
*  He was never charged. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6531.98s)]
*  Seemed like a post-pardon at that point. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6533.5s)]
*  He was about to be charged and he was never... [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6535.66s)]
*  What was Gerald Ford going to be charged? [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6537.74s)]
*  No, Nixon. Watergate scandal. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6539.1s)]
*  Oh, Watergate. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6541.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6542.38s)]
*  That's another one. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6544.3s)]
*  The Watergate one's a weird one, too, because the lead guy was an intelligence agent who was [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6546.86s)]
*  all of a sudden a reporter. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6554.54s)]
*  I guess the pre-pardon list. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6555.58s)]
*  George W. Bush gave some to the Iran Contra affair people. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6557.34s)]
*  Oh, what a good guy. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6559.9s)]
*  Casper Weinberger. There you go. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6561.98s)]
*  Abraham Lincoln did. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6565.98s)]
*  During the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln preempted pardons, [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6567.26s)]
*  part of the broader strategy to maintain national unity. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6570.38s)]
*  Okay. Extended to Confederate sympathizers and soldiers. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6573.34s)]
*  Okay. As an incentive to lay down arms and support the Union. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6577.1s)]
*  Jimmy Carter for the Vietnam draft? [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6580.46s)]
*  Yes. Well, that was a good one. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6583.34s)]
*  There's a few, but not the same reasons. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6586.86s)]
*  I remember I was a kid. I was living in San Francisco when the Vietnam War ended. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6588.94s)]
*  My parents were hippies. We were living in like Haight-Ashburg, [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6593.099999999999s)]
*  like down near Lombard Street in the middle of hippie San Francisco. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6596.299999999999s)]
*  And I remember thinking, as a little kid, thinking, wow, finally the war's over. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6601.5s)]
*  I don't have to think about war anymore. I'm like, people are going to learn from this. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6605.9s)]
*  I really believed that. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6610.219999999999s)]
*  You are, because you're a hopeful person. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6612.46s)]
*  Also, I was 10 or whatever I was. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6614.7s)]
*  Those 10 year olds, I guess, are pretty hopeful. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6618.46s)]
*  Yeah. Well, you're terrified because I, you know, [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6621.179999999999s)]
*  I had thought of the idea of being drafted like in eight years from now. Can I be drafted [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6624.38s)]
*  and have to go and fight for some fucking insane war that makes no sense? [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6629.179999999999s)]
*  And if you don't, they put you in a cage. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6632.46s)]
*  Like that was the reality of life in the 1960s when they had conscription. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6634.86s)]
*  That's scary shit, man. Being forced to give up your life to go fight in some [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6639.82s)]
*  fucking insane war that makes sense. It's probably about heroin. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6644.62s)]
*  Probably had a lot to do with heroin trade. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6649.9s)]
*  Well, yeah, they say that that bombing in Laos was a lot of that on the Ho Chi Minh Trail. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6654.86s)]
*  A lot of that had to do with that avenue for heroin there. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6660.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6664.46s)]
*  On that Ho Chi Minh Trail. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6664.86s)]
*  Well, how about Afghanistan? [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6666.38s)]
*  Yeah, Afghanistan. That can't be a coincidence. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6668.38s)]
*  Poppies there and poppies there. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6671.66s)]
*  Not only that, we were guarding poppy fields. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6674.86s)]
*  Because these farmers need to grow poppies is like this is how they make a living. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6678.3s)]
*  We've got to help them. We've got to fight the Taliban. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6683.58s)]
*  Then, you know, it's 90 plus percent of the world's opium that's coming from this area. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6686.3s)]
*  Like what? [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6691.18s)]
*  90 percent? [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6692.62s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6693.58s)]
*  Yeah. I think it's 94. I think it was 94 percent of the world's heroin [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6694.78s)]
*  was coming from Afghanistan while we were occupying Afghanistan. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6699.42s)]
*  Really? [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6703.66s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6704.14s)]
*  Now where is it coming from? [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6704.62s)]
*  Probably Afghanistan still. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6705.74s)]
*  Now it's safe. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6708.14s)]
*  I mean, the Taliban were the people that were against it, which is wild. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6710.22s)]
*  2021, Afghanistan produced more than 90 percent of the world's illicit heroin. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6713.74s)]
*  However, Myanmar has since surpassed Afghanistan. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6717.900000000001s)]
*  Well, didn't Myanmar just have a giant coup? [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6721.18s)]
*  Didn't they have a military takeover of Myanmar? [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6723.66s)]
*  I think they did. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6725.82s)]
*  I'm pretty sure because, yeah. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6727.1s)]
*  Maybe it's followed the drugs instead of followed the money. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6731.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6734.78s)]
*  Same thing maybe. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6735.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6736.62s)]
*  Myanmar coup, just right coup. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6739.74s)]
*  Yeah, four years after the coup, atrocity crimes. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6744.62s)]
*  Four years after the coup, chaos reigns as Myanmar's military struggles. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6749.26s)]
*  Yeah, they're probably taking control. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6753.34s)]
*  I mean, if you've got a place where now they've taken over [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6755.740000000001s)]
*  the heroin production of the world, then all of a sudden you have a military coup. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6758.860000000001s)]
*  Shocking. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6762.860000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6764.860000000001s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6765.820000000001s)]
*  It does seem to follow along these routes. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6766.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6770.700000000001s)]
*  It's just it's too many things to concentrate on. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6771.9800000000005s)]
*  That's the problem. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6774.38s)]
*  And we're all getting inundated every day with terrible news from all over the world. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6775.18s)]
*  And on one side, it makes people more accountable because now you know [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6779.26s)]
*  all the terrible things that are going on all over the world. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6782.38s)]
*  Another thing, it's like it's unmanageable. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6784.94s)]
*  If you're one human being living in Austin, your phone is blowing up all day with atrocities [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6787.0199999999995s)]
*  that are happening all over the world. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6791.5s)]
*  You're like, what can I do? [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6792.62s)]
*  What is life? [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6793.9s)]
*  Everything's terrible. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6795.0199999999995s)]
*  Meanwhile, you go to the coffee shop, everybody's nice. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6795.98s)]
*  You go to the restaurant, say hi to everybody. [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6798.46s)]
*  It's like my world seems pretty fucking normal. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6800.54s)]
*  But when you're inundated constantly, so you're in this constant state of anxiety and weirdness. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6803.82s)]
*  I know it's not a good thing, but I think that's why I stay away from the media. [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6810.459999999999s)]
*  I don't read newspapers. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6816.0599999999995s)]
*  I don't, you know, I just try to stay away because it's that toxifying element. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6818.0599999999995s)]
*  You know, it can really and granted, it keeps me ignorant. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6823.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6829.099999999999s)]
*  They do say ignorance is bliss and I feel pretty blessed. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6830.219999999999s)]
*  Well, as long as somebody's paying attention, I guess it's OK. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6835.98s)]
*  Well, I mean, about some of these items we've been discussing, you know, I've actually studied this. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6839.1s)]
*  So there's things, but there's other things that I just can't get hit every day with like 90 things [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6844.38s)]
*  that are so depressing. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6852.46s)]
*  You know, do you go on social media at all? [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6855.1s)]
*  No, I do have, I have, you know, what's the Zuckerberg? [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6857.42s)]
*  Dex? [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6863.9s)]
*  No. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6865.1s)]
*  Instagram? [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6866.14s)]
*  Instagram. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6866.86s)]
*  But because, you know, they make you like you have to give us all your information and access to your [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6868.46s)]
*  pictures. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6874.78s)]
*  So I can't personally get on the Instagram, but if I have a picture, I have to get someone else [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6875.179999999999s)]
*  to post the picture. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6881.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's probably healthier. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6882.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6884.54s)]
*  Huh? [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6885.0199999999995s)]
*  That's probably healthier. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6885.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6886.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6887.339999999999s)]
*  Than being on it all the time, because I know a lot of people that are on it all the time and [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6887.58s)]
*  it makes them sick. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6891.42s)]
*  It's like radiation poisoning. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6892.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I'm pretty much never on it. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6894.06s)]
*  That's good. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6897.580000000001s)]
*  But I should post more. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6898.620000000001s)]
*  I post like once every six months or something. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6900.38s)]
*  But no, I don't know. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6903.740000000001s)]
*  I'd rather have an alt to Instagram. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6905.5s)]
*  So how do you find out about- [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6910.3s)]
*  What do you think of a good alt? [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6911.18s)]
*  An alt? [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6913.18s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6913.740000000001s)]
*  The problem is, well, X is what I use the most as far as like getting information, but [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6914.54s)]
*  every now and then I'll go on and watch people argue and see like these toxic fights back and [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6921.42s)]
*  forth and that puts me in a shitty mood. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6927.34s)]
*  I'm like, God damn, why do people fucking treat each other like this? [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6928.86s)]
*  Like it's like such a stupid way to communicate. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6931.42s)]
*  Yeah, that is. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6934.78s)]
*  It's so disheartening. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6936.86s)]
*  And it's also it amplifies the worst aspects of our society, which is like shitty division. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6938.38s)]
*  It's like shitty division is what gets a lot of clicks. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6943.9800000000005s)]
*  You know, partisan thoughts and attacking people, tribal thinking, [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6946.860000000001s)]
*  that's what gets the most clicks and that's what you see the most. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6952.38s)]
*  But there's enough of exposing of actual legitimate corruption and information about [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6955.02s)]
*  what's actually going on in the world that I get out of there that it balances it out for me to [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6960.62s)]
*  the point where I'm willing to engage in it to a certain extent. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6964.54s)]
*  But I don't do it at night and I don't do it when I think it's going to like fuck me up before I go [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6967.74s)]
*  to bed. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6972.46s)]
*  I don't I don't do it if there's anything I really have to concentrate on because I [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6972.9400000000005s)]
*  don't want some new pathway to open up my mind when now I'm concerned about this. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6975.98s)]
*  But you you know, all of that adversity you face, [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6982.86s)]
*  do you feel like it actually increased your popularity? [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6986.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, definitely did. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6990.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, like during the covid stuff when I was they were trying to get me removed from Spotify. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6991.9s)]
*  In that one month, I gained two million subscribers. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6996.7s)]
*  Oh, really? [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=6999.9s)]
*  And the height of the attacks on me, the show got way bigger. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7001.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7005.82s)]
*  So how many people listen to that Robert Malone show? [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7006.86s)]
*  Would you say? [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7010.94s)]
*  That's a good question. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7011.66s)]
*  Between Spotify, YouTube and all the clips, fucking who knows hundreds of millions, probably. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7012.78s)]
*  Oh, great. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7019.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7020.94s)]
*  A good show that gets spread around like how many different eyeballs will see it. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7021.419999999999s)]
*  I mean, it really depends on how profound the person's revelations are, [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7026.0599999999995s)]
*  like what they're talking about. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7031.179999999999s)]
*  Like, you know, like the biggest one we ever did. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7032.3s)]
*  Well, some of the Elon. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7034.62s)]
*  Well, I think the biggest one we probably ever did was Bob Lazar. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7035.74s)]
*  Is that number one? [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7039.34s)]
*  So the Bob Lazar one, do you know Bob Lazar is? [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7041.42s)]
*  Bob Lazar is the guy that in 1989, he did an interview with George Knapp in Las Vegas, [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7046.22s)]
*  and he said he was working back engineering UFOs for the government. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7053.26s)]
*  And he has this crazy fucking story about working at area S4, [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7058.46s)]
*  site four, an area 51 in the Nevada desert, [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7063.900000000001s)]
*  which at that point in time, the government would deny that area 51 even existed. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7067.18s)]
*  He's like, no, I work out there. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7070.78s)]
*  And I was working back engineering propulsion systems from crashed UFOs. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7072.46s)]
*  And he's explaining how these things work and explaining how it's in some sort of a [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7077.18s)]
*  gravity propulsion device that works completely different than any [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7081.5s)]
*  propulsion device that we've ever devised, [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7084.54s)]
*  and that they're trying to back engineer them. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7086.7s)]
*  They don't know how to do it. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7088.38s)]
*  So they keep bringing in new propulsion experts. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7089.26s)]
*  So he was a guy that had previously worked at Los Alamos Labs. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7091.74s)]
*  And then he gets a job and they would, they're essentially throwing as much shit against the [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7095.66s)]
*  wall as possible trying to see what sticks like, can you figure this out? [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7100.94s)]
*  And they're bringing in new people. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7103.9s)]
*  And he was brought in apparently after allegedly after an accident where they [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7105.66s)]
*  tried to cut into the reactor and exploded and people died. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7109.9s)]
*  And so they said, okay, well, that's not going to work. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7113.74s)]
*  Let's try another method, bring in some other people. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7115.66s)]
*  And he was one of the people they brought in. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7118.54s)]
*  And when you have top secret clearance, what happens is they tap all your phones. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7120.54s)]
*  They listen to you all the time. [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7125.82s)]
*  Well, he had this job where he couldn't tell his wife what he was doing. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7127.099999999999s)]
*  So he would get this phone call saying that he has to fly out to area 51 at like 11 p.m. [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7130.62s)]
*  So he would go to the airport, fly out. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7136.0599999999995s)]
*  His wife was like, this motherfucker is cheating on me. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7137.66s)]
*  So she starts fucking her flight instructor. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7139.82s)]
*  She's got some flight instructor. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7141.9s)]
*  And so because his wife was having an affair and they knew it from the phone calls, [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7143.74s)]
*  they thought that he was going to be emotionally unstable. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7147.82s)]
*  So they removed him from the project. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7149.98s)]
*  So he gets removed from the project and he says, well, I'm telling my friends. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7151.82s)]
*  So he goes and tells friends like, this is what I was doing. [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7156.3s)]
*  I was working on these fucking UFOs. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7158.139999999999s)]
*  They have actual UFO. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7160.94s)]
*  That's the one that thing on the desk right there. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7162.139999999999s)]
*  That's the recreation of what he called the sport model that they worked on that has this [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7164.62s)]
*  this flying saucer that's behind the antlers. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7169.9s)]
*  That's like the classic. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7172.62s)]
*  It's like the Tesla three. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7174.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7176.46s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7176.78s)]
*  Right. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7177.82s)]
*  If you were the class peppy little sport model. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7178.14s)]
*  So he brings people out to to watch. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7182.78s)]
*  He said on Wednesday they have these flights and they test these things. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7187.34s)]
*  I'll take you guys out to the desert. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7191.18s)]
*  He took them out to the desert. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7192.94s)]
*  He takes them a couple of times. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7194.38s)]
*  Then he gets arrested. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7195.42s)]
*  So he gets arrested and he says, they're going to fucking kill me. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7196.46s)]
*  I have to go public. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7199.26s)]
*  So he goes public and tells the whole story. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7200.38s)]
*  And so he does these series of interviews with George Knapp, who's an investigative [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7202.7s)]
*  reporter in in Las Vegas. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7206.86s)]
*  And they become legendary. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7209.26s)]
*  He's told the same story for now going on 40 years. [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7210.62s)]
*  And it's and he's still alive. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7214.62s)]
*  He's still alive. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7217.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7217.82s)]
*  He did my podcast. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7217.9800000000005s)]
*  So he did the podcast. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7219.1s)]
*  And I don't know what to think. [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7220.06s)]
*  I don't know if he's telling the truth or not. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7221.18s)]
*  It's hard to know. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7222.54s)]
*  But he's told the same goddamn story for all these years. [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7223.34s)]
*  And he's obviously a brilliant guy. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7226.22s)]
*  When you talk to him, he's obviously very literate in science, really understands what [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7228.139999999999s)]
*  he's saying. [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7232.54s)]
*  And many of the things that he said from that particular interview have been corroborated [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7233.74s)]
*  by other people, including his knowledge of Los Alamos Labs. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7240.139999999999s)]
*  They tried to say he never worked there, but they found him on the employee roster. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7244.219999999999s)]
*  And he knows the building. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7247.66s)]
*  He took people into the building. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7248.78s)]
*  He took George Knapp in there. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7249.98s)]
*  He knew the security guards. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7251.0199999999995s)]
*  He knew where to go, showing everybody around the place. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7252.139999999999s)]
*  And that's our biggest podcast ever because it's so fucking nuts. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7255.5s)]
*  There's an incredible Jeremy Corbell did an incredible documentary called Bob Lazar Area [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7260.14s)]
*  51 and Flying Saucers. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7266.86s)]
*  And it's all about his experiences there. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7268.38s)]
*  And it's one of those things where you just you don't know. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7270.78s)]
*  But it's God, it's so weird. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7275.58s)]
*  It's like if this guy's telling the same goddamn story, and then they have all these [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7278.3s)]
*  videos of these things that the go fast video and the FLIR video that the government's [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7281.9s)]
*  released that were covered in the New York Times. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7286.94s)]
*  And these crafts are exhibiting the same sort of behavior that he was explaining in 1989. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7289.5s)]
*  Particularly in they they fly like this. [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7295.9s)]
*  But then when they want to go fast, they rotate sideways and point whatever this gravity [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7297.9s)]
*  propulsion, whatever this thing is, this generator, and they shoot this way and take off. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7302.46s)]
*  And there's videos of these things doing this. [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7309.58s)]
*  Wow. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7312.62s)]
*  40 years later. [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7313.179999999999s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7315.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7316.62s)]
*  So that's the biggest video. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7317.339999999999s)]
*  I got a yeah. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7318.299999999999s)]
*  So that video on YouTube got 60 million views and then on all the other platforms, [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7319.339999999999s)]
*  who knows how many and all the clips, it's probably hundreds of millions. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7326.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7331.179999999999s)]
*  Bizarre. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7332.379999999999s)]
*  But it's one of those things where you don't want to think too much about it because it [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7334.54s)]
*  might be bullshit. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7337.58s)]
*  You know, that's how I feel about the whole UFO thing. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7339.0199999999995s)]
*  What would be his point? [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7341.9800000000005s)]
*  What's his motivation? [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7343.1s)]
*  It's a good question. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7344.54s)]
*  I don't see how it benefits him other than he's got now people calling him a wacko. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7345.74s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7351.1s)]
*  Which he didn't have before. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7351.66s)]
*  So what's the good of it? [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7352.9400000000005s)]
*  Right. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7354.7s)]
*  That's a good. [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7355.42s)]
*  Well, you always got to look at possible motivation. [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7356.14s)]
*  Well, there's a lot of people that want to pretend to be special. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7359.34s)]
*  And so they make up stories so that make them special. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7362.06s)]
*  They make up encounters. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7364.54s)]
*  They make up abductions. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7366.06s)]
*  I've been abducted by aliens. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7367.900000000001s)]
*  I'm a special person. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7370.14s)]
*  They took me aboard. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7371.1s)]
*  I have a message for humanity. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7371.82s)]
*  There's a lot of that. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7373.58s)]
*  There's a lot of delusions. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7374.9400000000005s)]
*  That's a different thing. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7377.42s)]
*  I mean, a guy like that, I don't see his, you know, if that's what he actually did for [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7379.66s)]
*  a living, then I don't see why he benefits. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7385.9800000000005s)]
*  Well, one of the more interesting stories is this guy's. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7389.9s)]
*  This is Travis Walton. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7392.14s)]
*  This guy's got a little bobblehead. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7393.66s)]
*  Travis Walton was a guy. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7395.66s)]
*  I don't know if you ever saw that movie Fire in the Sky. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7397.1s)]
*  It was based on a bunch of loggers in Arizona. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7400.22s)]
*  And they saw this thing land. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7403.26s)]
*  And this guy, Travis Walton, gets out of the truck and goes to it gets blasted by this [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7405.1s)]
*  this bolt of energy collapses to the ground. [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7409.5s)]
*  His buddies take off. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7412.62s)]
*  They're screaming in the car. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7413.9800000000005s)]
*  All these loggers like we got to go back and get them. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7415.18s)]
*  We got to go back and get them. [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7416.9400000000005s)]
*  They turn around a mile later, go back. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7417.82s)]
*  He's gone. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7419.58s)]
*  He's gone for five days. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7420.7s)]
*  And then he shows up back in the town five days later with this fucking wild story of [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7422.7s)]
*  being abducted, taken aboard this craft. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7428.14s)]
*  They healed his body and then they communicated with him and then returned him. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7430.3s)]
*  And the thing about it is like all these experiences, these people talk about the exact same creatures. [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7434.62s)]
*  They talk about the exact same entities, these things with big heads and large eyes and spindly [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7441.26s)]
*  bodies and they're communicating telepathically. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7446.54s)]
*  It's like it's universal. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7448.9400000000005s)]
*  It's like over and over again. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7450.780000000001s)]
*  It's a very similar story. [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7452.14s)]
*  And the problem is if it happened to you, who the fuck is going to believe you? [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7455.02s)]
*  It's a unique experience, a completely novel experience that only you have. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7457.9s)]
*  And then you have to go and try to make sense of it to other people that haven't experienced it. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7462.54s)]
*  And they're going to think you're fucking crazy. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7467.259999999999s)]
*  But if you have enough of these people that say the same story over and over and over again, [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7469.099999999999s)]
*  which is if you read John Mack, he was a psychologist from Harvard that did a lot of [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7475.259999999999s)]
*  hypnotic regression work with people that have had alien abductions. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7480.7s)]
*  And this guy was like, did you ever? [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7484.299999999999s)]
*  It's a crazy book. [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7486.379999999999s)]
*  I met John. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7487.58s)]
*  Did you really? [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7488.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7488.700000000001s)]
*  When did you meet him? [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7489.02s)]
*  I met him on the campus at Harvard. [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7490.3s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7494.38s)]
*  You know, I went to Harvard, right? [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7495.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7496.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7497.5s)]
*  I mean, I had a great night and then went back home. [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7497.9800000000005s)]
*  No, I only visited there a couple of times. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7502.780000000001s)]
*  Well, I know you play really good chess. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7508.06s)]
*  I do play chess. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7510.620000000001s)]
*  Magnus Carlsen told me. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7511.58s)]
*  I had Magnus Carlsen in a couple of days ago. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7513.34s)]
*  He told me that you did one of his opening moves, that you did it for him. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7515.58s)]
*  And he was like, what the fuck is he doing? [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7519.42s)]
*  Like he couldn't even figure out why you did them. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7520.94s)]
*  But he realized afterwards, like, oh, you're a really good chess player. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7522.94s)]
*  That was actually a legitimate move. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7525.66s)]
*  You did his opening, right? [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7527.5s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7529.42s)]
*  I did one time I did an opening for the other guy. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7531.5s)]
*  What's his name? [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7535.74s)]
*  Well, anyway, and I'm going to do this opening. [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7536.54s)]
*  And at the same time, I want to tip over with my pinky tip over the king. [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7540.14s)]
*  Just as a joke, you know, because you tip over the king, the game's over. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7545.26s)]
*  Right. [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7548.78s)]
*  So I did that. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7549.0199999999995s)]
*  But then and it was kind of a chuckle and everything and picked it up. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7551.5s)]
*  And then he's looking quite concerned. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7556.38s)]
*  Oh, yeah, this was it. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7560.94s)]
*  Oh, I hear the lady. [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7566.22s)]
*  Yeah, I knocked it down and then I pushed it. [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7569.74s)]
*  Yeah, they slow it down. [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7575.0199999999995s)]
*  You can see it. [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7576.22s)]
*  But then I pushed the pawn, right? [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7577.0199999999995s)]
*  And then I really because I thought he said D4. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7578.78s)]
*  Right. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7583.0199999999995s)]
*  He didn't say D4. [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7584.38s)]
*  He said E4. [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7586.14s)]
*  So I'm looking at his face and he had whispered it to me into my bad ear. [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7587.5s)]
*  And I'm like, well, what do you got to whisper? [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7592.38s)]
*  I'm going to make the move anyway. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7595.58s)]
*  Well, Magnus said you stuck around and you played a lot of people and he said you were really good. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7597.66s)]
*  Oh, that's very nice. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7602.22s)]
*  Coming from him. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7603.66s)]
*  He's the Mozart. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7605.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7607.42s)]
*  Fascinating guy. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7608.3s)]
*  He was here a couple days ago. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7609.42s)]
*  Was he? [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7610.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7611.5s)]
*  Yeah, I do admire him. [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7612.3s)]
*  He's great. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7614.3s)]
*  And that whole thing that just happened with the jeans, like that was great. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7615.0199999999995s)]
*  Did you see it? [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7620.54s)]
*  He went to one of the big, I forget which tournament it was, but anyway, [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7622.38s)]
*  came in jeans and they're very strict. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7627.5s)]
*  Right. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7630.62s)]
*  And so they wouldn't allow him to play. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7631.1s)]
*  And then so he basically was going to end up sacrificing the day because he came in jeans. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7633.900000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7641.26s)]
*  He said, I just wasn't thinking about it. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7641.42s)]
*  You know, well, so then he just say, you know, you'll have to come back tomorrow. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7643.26s)]
*  You're sacrificed for the day. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7649.02s)]
*  He's like, you know what? [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7650.46s)]
*  I won't be back tomorrow. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7651.34s)]
*  And then the boom, they changed the rules. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7652.780000000001s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7655.58s)]
*  They changed it. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7656.38s)]
*  Yeah, that's a stupid rule. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7657.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7659.26s)]
*  Who gives a shit if you're wearing jeans? [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7659.66s)]
*  I know that should be able to play in a bikini. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7661.66s)]
*  That doesn't make you a better or worse player. [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7663.42s)]
*  Yeah, it's stupid. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7665.74s)]
*  Everybody should be able to have to play in their underwear. [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7666.7s)]
*  That way, you know, they don't have any devices on them. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7668.62s)]
*  They could have it in them too. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7671.98s)]
*  They could. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7673.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7673.98s)]
*  Maybe you got to do a rectal probing before. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7674.38s)]
*  This is full circle with the talking about the aliens, but you know, maybe you have to [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7677.66s)]
*  do something before. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7682.46s)]
*  Well, we got into very specific ways that people cheat. [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7684.7s)]
*  It was pretty interesting. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7687.18s)]
*  He was talking to us about different ways that people have been busted cheating, different [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7688.62s)]
*  people signaling them in the room, moving to different parts of the room if they wanted [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7693.099999999999s)]
*  the piece to move in a different area. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7697.099999999999s)]
*  Oh, I see. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7698.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7699.5s)]
*  Yeah, because that one guy he said was cheating, he said he knew as soon as the move was made [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7700.0599999999995s)]
*  and then he walked out. [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7705.5s)]
*  That was another time. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7706.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7707.9s)]
*  He just like, there's no way this guy made this move. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7708.62s)]
*  No chance. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7711.9s)]
*  That was what was fascinating that you could tell by the way a guy's playing that something [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7712.54s)]
*  was amiss. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7717.0199999999995s)]
*  This is not inside of his capability. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7718.7s)]
*  He knew the way the guy played so well that you could tell that something was off, which [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7720.62s)]
*  is so crazy, which is I'm not literate in chess, so I don't understand how you could [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7726.54s)]
*  do that, but I believe him, especially when you talk to him. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7731.339999999999s)]
*  Well, he's got a thumper in his sock or something. [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7735.179999999999s)]
*  Somebody's giving him a... [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7738.0599999999995s)]
*  He thinks it's an earpiece. [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7739.259999999999s)]
*  ...looking on a computer and dun-dun telling him... [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7739.82s)]
*  He thinks it's an internal ear, like a very small, invisible earpiece that they put in. [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7742.7s)]
*  Is that what he thought? [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7746.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7747.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7748.46s)]
*  That's what he thinks. [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7748.78s)]
*  He thinks it's one of the possible methods. [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7749.5s)]
*  And then there was the anal beads. [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7751.74s)]
*  People were talking about anal beads. [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7753.34s)]
*  Anal beads. [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7754.46s)]
*  It's a guy who don't want a thumper in his sock. [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7756.0599999999995s)]
*  He just wants to get pure inside man. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7758.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7761.98s)]
*  I guess it would vibrate. [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7762.3s)]
*  I guess you would do it vibrate a certain amount of times first to indicate the letter [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7763.98s)]
*  and then a couple times to indicate the number. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7769.0199999999995s)]
*  That's where the piece would go. [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7772.46s)]
*  Little Morse code in the rectal cavity. [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7773.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7777.179999999999s)]
*  How long you been playing chess? [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7778.7s)]
*  I started playing more probably like 10 years ago or maybe more than that. [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7781.179999999999s)]
*  I started playing Willie. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7788.3s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7790.94s)]
*  I started playing Willie all the time. [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7791.82s)]
*  But then we'd switch over back to dominoes. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7794.38s)]
*  He crushes me in dominoes. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7797.099999999999s)]
*  And then I was mostly winning chess. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7799.099999999999s)]
*  And then toward the end of our battles, he started switching to just, you know, [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7801.66s)]
*  we'll just stay with the dominoes. [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7808.62s)]
*  Such a hustler. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7812.22s)]
*  Such a hustler. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7813.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7815.18s)]
*  I tried to interview him, but he's scared of COVID. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7815.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7819.0199999999995s)]
*  He's an old guy. [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7819.26s)]
*  I get it. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7821.0199999999995s)]
*  He's 92. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7821.5s)]
*  Can't take a chance getting infected. [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7822.38s)]
*  A lot of old people, I got it. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7827.42s)]
*  I got the fear because it's like death is close to them. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7829.02s)]
*  It's just they're too vulnerable. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7832.540000000001s)]
*  I get it. [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7834.06s)]
*  I get why they got roped into it. [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7834.620000000001s)]
*  Well, yeah, the fear of germs. [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7837.740000000001s)]
*  That was the Neil Young thing, too. [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7842.38s)]
*  That's why I gave Neil Young a pass. [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7844.06s)]
*  You still see him wearing masks. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7847.1s)]
*  Oh, all the time. [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7848.860000000001s)]
*  Even in Austin. [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7850.46s)]
*  I see him driving their fucking car still with masks on. [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7851.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7854.780000000001s)]
*  Alone in the car with the mask. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7855.42s)]
*  Yeah, they're just sick. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7857.1s)]
*  Confuses me. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7858.06s)]
*  But, you know, fear is a fairly relentless occupation for some. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7859.1s)]
*  And I don't know. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7868.22s)]
*  I studied the germ theory. [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7871.660000000001s)]
*  You know how it came to be the backbone of Western medicine. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7875.26s)]
*  Do you know? [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7879.18s)]
*  The Rockefeller thing? [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7879.660000000001s)]
*  Well, yeah, that came after this. [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7881.02s)]
*  But yeah, the Rockefeller pushed that whole narrative. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7883.82s)]
*  But it was before that in the 18... [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7889.42s)]
*  What was it? [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7893.5s)]
*  1887 or something? [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7894.0599999999995s)]
*  89 where Louis Pasteur stood before the French Academy of Science and said, [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7897.98s)]
*  I've realized the origin of all disease and it's the germ theory. [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7906.0599999999995s)]
*  And he took credit for the germ theory, which, of course, had been around for [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7910.46s)]
*  centuries at that point. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7915.02s)]
*  But there was another guy named Antoine Béchamp, who was actually a real genius. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7917.1s)]
*  Whereas Pasteur was a charlatan and used to... [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7925.42s)]
*  He basically stole all these good ideas that he never had from Antoine Béchamp, [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7931.58s)]
*  including how fermentation works. [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7937.18s)]
*  How they had diseases in the grapes at the time. [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7940.54s)]
*  So how to deal with that disease and also having to do with... [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7945.9s)]
*  Where they make the silk worms and stuff. [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7956.86s)]
*  That also was another thing that Béchamp figured out. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7960.94s)]
*  And then Pasteur, who was on the same committee, ends up reading these papers [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7965.099999999999s)]
*  and basically kind of putting his own spin on it and getting credit for the fermentation, [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7972.139999999999s)]
*  the silk worm, the wine thing. [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7977.98s)]
*  Each thing, he becomes more and more famous. [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7980.46s)]
*  Until he's able to sit down in front of Napoleon in 1863, Napoleon III, he said, [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7984.7s)]
*  I will eliminate all disease. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7992.219999999999s)]
*  I will eradicate all human disease. [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7994.38s)]
*  He was an arrogant guy and he was a complete fraud. [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=7997.26s)]
*  And Pasteur believed the germ theory, obviously. [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8001.5s)]
*  That's the theory that he pushed, right? [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8006.06s)]
*  And then Béchamp believed in the terrain theory. [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8008.38s)]
*  Now, that's what I believe. [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8013.1s)]
*  The terrain theory, the germ theory, obviously, a pathogen, a germ, a virus, whatever, [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8014.9400000000005s)]
*  lands in your cornflakes or on your eyeball or whatever, gets inside you. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8022.94s)]
*  And then in this blank, pristine, blank slate environment, [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8028.62s)]
*  it causes damage, maybe sickness and eventually death. [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8033.179999999999s)]
*  To me, I don't believe this theory as much as I do the terrain theory, [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8036.94s)]
*  which is that your health is dependent upon your internal biological terrain [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8044.94s)]
*  and your internal filthiness or cleanliness. [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8050.22s)]
*  And so that's what I believe is where people's immune system gets messed up [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8053.58s)]
*  from what they're consuming. [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8058.860000000001s)]
*  And in a nutshell, that's why I believe in Béchamp's theory as opposed to the germ theory. [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8061.26s)]
*  And at least it's got to be both. [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8069.9800000000005s)]
*  At the very least, it's got to be both. [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8071.900000000001s)]
*  I would imagine it's both. [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8074.3s)]
*  I mean, we know for a fact that one of the main factors in eliminating diseases in North America [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8076.38s)]
*  was when they started having hygiene and when they started having flowing water [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8084.46s)]
*  and sewage systems and that just having cleanliness. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8091.42s)]
*  I mean, most cities at the turn of the century were filled with filth. [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8098.14s)]
*  During the smallpox epidemic, people lived terrible. [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8103.259999999999s)]
*  They lived in filth. [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8106.86s)]
*  There's a bunch of different diseases that can be attributed to poor hygiene. [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8113.099999999999s)]
*  Poor hygiene, no access to antibiotics, no access to any kind of medicine. [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8116.78s)]
*  And we all attribute that just to a disease broke out. [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8121.98s)]
*  But why did the disease break out? [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8125.82s)]
*  Well, the people who were living in filth, there was no running water. [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8127.179999999999s)]
*  They didn't have any sewage systems. [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8131.34s)]
*  They didn't have any sort of antibiotics, including like when people talk about the [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8135.02s)]
*  Spanish flu, like the Spanish flu broke out today, we'd be fucked. [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8139.820000000001s)]
*  No, we wouldn't. [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8142.46s)]
*  First of all, we have antibiotics now. [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8143.34s)]
*  Spanish flu would be killed quickly. [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8145.9800000000005s)]
*  It's the real factor was all these diseases that people were getting because of the infection [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8147.66s)]
*  that could be cured by antibiotics. [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8153.66s)]
*  But also- [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8158.7s)]
*  I'm not a big antibiotics guy. [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8158.9400000000005s)]
*  At all? [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8160.94s)]
*  No, I mean, I took them. [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8162.54s)]
*  I took them one time. [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8164.0599999999995s)]
*  I credit them with really having saved me. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8166.54s)]
*  But- [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8169.5s)]
*  Oh, they'll save you under certain conditions. [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8170.139999999999s)]
*  Right, right. [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8171.98s)]
*  If your immune system shot and there's nothing else you can do to bolster your immune system [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8173.179999999999s)]
*  in a short amount of time where whatever is happening is happening quickly. [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8180.139999999999s)]
*  But you're saying like ubiquitous use of antibiotics for everything. [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8186.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah, where it's just like- [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8189.339999999999s)]
*  It's probably not a good idea. [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8191.099999999999s)]
*  It's like a PEZ dispenser. [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8191.26s)]
*  And it does affect your immune system adversely, especially continuous use of antibiotics. [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8194.38s)]
*  It's also why we have MRSA. [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8200.3s)]
*  What? [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8202.38s)]
*  MRSA. [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8203.02s)]
*  MRSA is medication resistant staph infections. [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8203.74s)]
*  Right, right. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8206.619999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8207.66s)]
*  I've had a bunch of friends who get that because that's one of the side effects. [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8208.46s)]
*  One of the unfortunate aspects of Jiu Jitsu is a lot of guys get staph infections. [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8211.66s)]
*  If you're not clean, you're not taken care of. [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8218.14s)]
*  Because of what? [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8219.98s)]
*  Getting scratched and scraped up and you're on the ground, dirty mats. [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8220.54s)]
*  People come in dirty and you can get an infection. [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8225.42s)]
*  I've had staph twice. [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8228.380000000001s)]
*  You get staph, ringworm, a bunch of different things that people normally get on the mat. [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8229.660000000002s)]
*  But there's ways to combat that in a healthy organic way. [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8234.220000000001s)]
*  And one of the best ways is the use of- [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8239.580000000002s)]
*  There's a bunch of different oils, tea tree oil and eucalyptus oil, [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8243.660000000002s)]
*  a bunch of oils that don't affect your skin biome in a negative way. [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8247.42s)]
*  But what they do is they protect you from bad diseases. [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8252.62s)]
*  There's a company called Defense Soap. [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8255.26s)]
*  And I always recommend it to- [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8257.5s)]
*  I don't have any affiliation with them. [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8258.460000000001s)]
*  My friend Guy Sacco runs the company. [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8260.06s)]
*  But he developed it because a bunch of wrestlers and grapplers were getting skin infections. [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8261.98s)]
*  And so he developed natural remedies that don't affect your- [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8267.74s)]
*  Because a lot of times guys would take like antibiotic soap [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8272.7s)]
*  and they would clean themselves with antibiotic soap. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8276.14s)]
*  The problem with that is it kills all your healthy flora, [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8278.06s)]
*  all the skin flora that's healthy. [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8281.019999999999s)]
*  That gets torched too. [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8282.46s)]
*  It's taken a blow torch to like a small patch of weed so you can just pluck out. [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8283.74s)]
*  And instead of doing that, he developed this soap that uses all these natural organic remedies [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8289.1s)]
*  that doesn't affect you in a negative way at all. [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8297.1s)]
*  So the only soap I use, I use that soap every day. [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8299.98s)]
*  And it keeps your skin healthy and it doesn't fuck it up. [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8302.46s)]
*  So there's ways around it. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8305.5s)]
*  Though the real way is to prevent it though because once you actually get staph, [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8306.78s)]
*  especially if it's aggressive, you got to take antibiotics or you're fucked. [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8310.62s)]
*  Well- [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8315.26s)]
*  It gets systemic. [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8317.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8318.62s)]
*  My friend's wife- [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8319.18s)]
*  Oh sorry, go ahead. [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8320.54s)]
*  My friend, his friend's wife rather died of it. [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8321.740000000002s)]
*  She was trying to do it organically. [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8324.380000000001s)]
*  She was trying to like use herbal remedies and she wound up dying of staph infection. [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8326.220000000001s)]
*  Because it gets systemic. [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8330.300000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it gets into your blood and goes into your whole body. [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8331.34s)]
*  And then you're fucked. [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8334.38s)]
*  But you really have to get on a heavy, hardcore IV antibiotics for long stretches of time. [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8335.259999999998s)]
*  So I've had friends that have huge scars on their body because they got a massive [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8340.619999999999s)]
*  MRSA infection in their knees. [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8346.22s)]
*  And then they had to get it all opened up. [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8348.14s)]
*  They have to clean it out and they have to get them on IV antibiotics. [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8350.3s)]
*  It's a fucking, it's a nightmare. [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8353.82s)]
*  And it's one of the main reasons why people die after surgeries. [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8355.42s)]
*  It happens after surgeries where people get MRSA infections. [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8359.74s)]
*  Hmm. [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8362.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8363.980000000001s)]
*  Well, Jesus. [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8364.7s)]
*  Super bugs. [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8366.7s)]
*  Let's just stay healthy. [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8367.34s)]
*  Yes. [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8368.7s)]
*  Stay healthy, Woody. [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8369.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8370.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8371.34s)]
*  Do you eat only vegetables? [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8371.900000000001s)]
*  Is that what you're talking about? [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8373.02s)]
*  Like meat? [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8373.900000000001s)]
*  Are you a vegan? [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8374.86s)]
*  I'm a vegan. [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8376.54s)]
*  Yeah? [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8377.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8378.380000000001s)]
*  But, you know, I mean, I really, my real belief is in raw living food. [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8381.5s)]
*  Because I feel like, you know, we talk a lot about you getting your protein or you're getting [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8389.34s)]
*  your carbs or whatever. [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8395.26s)]
*  I think the most important component of the food are the enzymes. [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8397.02s)]
*  The enzymes being the life force of the food and the enzymatic activities, your eyes [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8402.220000000001s)]
*  blinking, your heart beating, those are enzymatic activities. [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8409.1s)]
*  If it wasn't for enzymes, we couldn't do them. [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8411.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8413.9s)]
*  Like enzymes are highly important. [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8414.460000000001s)]
*  Anything you cook over 118 degrees for a minute, you destroy the enzymes and most of [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8416.38s)]
*  the nutritional value of the food. [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8422.38s)]
*  And that's why I'm a believer in raw living food. [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8424.699999999999s)]
*  And I just know from when I, you know, I've had lots of experiments from when I was doing [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8428.619999999999s)]
*  it and when I was eating a lot of cooked food. [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8436.46s)]
*  And, you know, you can really feel the difference. [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8438.859999999999s)]
*  There's no question about it supporting the energy of the body better than anything. [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8441.9s)]
*  But meanwhile, I agree that it's very hard to avoid eating cooked food because it's delicious. [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8448.3s)]
*  But to have as much raw as possible, that's my thing. [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8455.18s)]
*  And I eat, you know, I take, I try to get a lot of sprouts and micro greens and everything. [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8460.06s)]
*  And then, you know, I also eat, you know, cooked food. [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8468.22s)]
*  Do you take algae or anything where you're getting B vitamins? [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8472.62s)]
*  Do you think? [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8476.78s)]
*  Yeah, I take, right. [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8477.98s)]
*  I do take, I take niacin. [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8480.460000000001s)]
*  I take, I should take more of a comprehensive B vitamin probably. [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8483.58s)]
*  But I do take reishi and I take ginseng every day. [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8488.86s)]
*  So healthy mushrooms? [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8494.619999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I believe in the healthy mushrooms. [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8497.66s)]
*  I take all that stuff too. [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8500.539999999999s)]
*  Yeah, there's a cool, yeah, I gotta get on the regular medicinal mushrooms. [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8501.82s)]
*  Those are crucial. [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8507.339999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8508.46s)]
*  And especially brain repair, which is I think something I need. [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8508.859999999999s)]
*  I think we all do. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8515.98s)]
*  To fix those pathways that have been compromised. [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8517.019999999999s)]
*  Do you ever fuck around with nootropics? [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8521.099999999999s)]
*  Do you take any nootropics? [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8522.539999999999s)]
*  Like what? [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8524.619999999999s)]
*  Nootropics are essentially nutrients that contribute to cognitive function. [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8525.74s)]
*  Building blocks for human neurotransmitters, acetylcholine, theanine, things along those lines. [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8531.339999999998s)]
*  No, I don't do that, but I'm open-minded. [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8537.82s)]
*  I imagine Downey would know all about that stuff. [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8542.939999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I bet he would. [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8546.3s)]
*  He's really, really knowledgeable about that. [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8548.38s)]
*  But you've studied this shit too. [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8551.019999999999s)]
*  The thing about it is you could almost take stuff all day long, [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8554.539999999999s)]
*  because there's so many different things that could benefit you. [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8558.939999999999s)]
*  You'd have to have a fucking stack of shit in front of you all day long, which gets tiresome. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8561.74s)]
*  Yeah, I much prefer, I think the best thing for restoring health for [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8569.419999999998s)]
*  if you're sick and you want to get better is fasting. [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8578.22s)]
*  Fasting is fantastic for you. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8581.98s)]
*  Thousands of years and it just works. [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8583.02s)]
*  It does. [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8585.74s)]
*  Because the congestion in the body is really what disease is. [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8586.300000000001s)]
*  It's congestion. [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8591.18s)]
*  It's inflammation. [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8592.060000000001s)]
*  And generally, but yeah, inflammation, you could call it that too, [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8592.78s)]
*  but that congestion begins in the colon. [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8596.62s)]
*  And so you don't clean that out, issues. [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8601.98s)]
*  Yeah. Do you concern yourself, do you eat organic vegetables only? [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8606.300000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8610.380000000001s)]
*  That's huge. [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8611.66s)]
*  Because I think, what is it, like 90 something percent of people tested [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8612.380000000001s)]
*  have glyphosate in their system. [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8617.26s)]
*  I was reading some study on fucking on Girl Scout cookies. [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8619.02s)]
*  Like how many, like they've done studies on Girl Scout cookies where they break them down [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8624.140000000001s)]
*  and find out what's in them. [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8628.380000000001s)]
*  Holy shit. [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8630.060000000001s)]
*  They're fucking toxic as fuck. [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8631.5s)]
*  I'll send it to you, Jamie, because I sent it to my wife because she's trying to avoid [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8635.42s)]
*  Girl Scout cookies. [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8638.94s)]
*  You see the smiling face of the Girl Scout. [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8639.74s)]
*  You can imagine she's going to give you something bad. [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8642.78s)]
*  Yeah. Those little hustlers, they catch you at the grocery store. [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8645.5s)]
*  I'll find this for you, Jamie. [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8650.54s)]
*  There was this thing about, oh, here it is. [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8652.220000000001s)]
*  Different seed oils, all the different things in them. [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8657.18s)]
*  Yeah, it's probably one of them. [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8662.86s)]
*  What does it say here? [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8664.060000000001s)]
*  Thin mints being the worst offenders, five flavors of Girl Scout cookies contained [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8665.74s)]
*  contained levels of glyphosate and heavy metals above EPA water safety limits. [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8672.78s)]
*  New investigation found 100% of tested Girl Scout cookies contained glyphosate, 100% [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8677.82s)]
*  controversial herbicide and Roundup. [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8683.58s)]
*  88% contained toxic metals like arsenic, lead, and mercury. [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8685.34s)]
*  Key finding, thin mints had the highest glyphosate levels at 111.07 ppb. [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8689.9s)]
*  334 times what experts say is harmful. [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8698.86s)]
*  Peanut butter patties had the highest heavy metal contamination with lead reaching 42.5 ppb [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8703.58s)]
*  and aluminum at 27,500 ppb. [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8710.699999999999s)]
*  76% of cookies tested exceeded cadmium safety limits and 96 contained lead. [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8716.619999999999s)]
*  Girl Scout USA, which sells 200 million boxes per year, [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8724.3s)]
*  800 million dollars in revenue, did not respond to researchers before publication. [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8727.74s)]
*  I wonder why. [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8732.3s)]
*  Didn't respond. [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8732.78s)]
*  I wonder why. I wonder why they wouldn't chime in. [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8733.58s)]
*  See, there you go. And by the way, that's that you could replicate this same thing in [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8739.1s)]
*  so much of the American diet. [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8743.9s)]
*  Well, as the Girl Scout cookies have to say, Girl Scout cookies are made with ingredients [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8745.82s)]
*  that adhere to food safety standards set by the FDA and other relevant authorities. [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8749.1s)]
*  Oh, really? [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8753.18s)]
*  Our trusted bakers remain committed to compliance with all food safety standards. [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8754.86s)]
*  Maybe we should change the fucking food safety standards. [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8758.699999999999s)]
*  Just because you're complying with bullshit standards. [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8761.66s)]
*  That's what I'm hoping is going to happen going forward. [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8764.06s)]
*  I'm hoping too. I think, you know, I don't know how much Bobby can affect things [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8766.779999999999s)]
*  and what he actually can do, but I know what he's trying to do. [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8771.34s)]
*  And one of the main things he's trying to do is this whole idea of this Maha movement, [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8774.14s)]
*  make America healthy again. And that's possible. [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8778.54s)]
*  This is something we could do and be so nice to it. [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8782.06s)]
*  And then and you know, not a lot of, you know, it could be relatively simple. [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8785.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8791.02s)]
*  Just modification doesn't have to be a revolution in one's diet. [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8791.82s)]
*  But like, you know, first thing I do is cut out Girl Scout Cookies. [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8796.86s)]
*  It's crazy that 100% of them have glyphosate. [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8805.34s)]
*  Like fucking A, man. [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8807.74s)]
*  With the glyphosate, it's just absolutely crazy. [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8808.94s)]
*  And, you know, like it's just still we know how toxic and terrible it is. [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8811.980000000001s)]
*  And we're still using it constantly. [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8816.54s)]
*  And other countries aren't. [[02:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8818.78s)]
*  In corporate, you know, or industrial farming. [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8819.820000000002s)]
*  You know, it's just wrong. [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8822.7s)]
*  I know you're into regenerative farming. [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8824.300000000001s)]
*  I think that's great. [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8826.3s)]
*  But, you know, you see over the long haul, the regenerative farmer gains. [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8828.3s)]
*  He gains financially and he gains in terms of the soil not just turning to shit. [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8833.42s)]
*  Well, you want some shit in your soil. [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8840.619999999999s)]
*  Okay, well, let's not get sidetracked. [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8842.46s)]
*  But yeah, like, you know, it's a net gain in the end. [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8845.82s)]
*  So hopefully. [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8850.38s)]
*  It's carbon neutral. [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8851.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8852.859999999999s)]
*  Everyone's trying to reduce carbon. [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8853.099999999999s)]
*  Organic farms are carbon neutral because that's how nature intended animals to live. [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8854.86s)]
*  That's how nature intended us to grow crops. [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8860.460000000001s)]
*  It's all supposed to be animals, graze, manure, all this different stuff. [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8863.26s)]
*  It helps. [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8868.380000000001s)]
*  You got to think of the soil biome just as much as you have to think of your own biome. [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8869.66s)]
*  Yeah, and it all works together. [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8874.86s)]
*  And thank God there's people out there like Joel Salatin who runs Polyface Farms [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8876.300000000001s)]
*  and Will Harris who runs White Oak Pastors who have educated these people and gone written [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8881.26s)]
*  books and gone on these tours and explained to be like Will Harris, who's been on the podcast [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8886.78s)]
*  a couple of times, he spent 20 years changing his family farm, which was a industrial farm [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8891.5s)]
*  into regenerative agriculture. [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8898.86s)]
*  And you can see the difference in the soil. [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8900.380000000001s)]
*  We have two bottles of soil, two glass bottles of soil out there, one from an industrial farm [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8902.54s)]
*  and one from his farm. [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8909.34s)]
*  And his farm is dark and rich and filled with nutrients. [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8910.54s)]
*  And the other one is just pale and dead and just covered in bullshit fucking chemicals. [[02:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8914.380000000001s)]
*  And meanwhile, that's the stuff that gets highly subsidized. [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8921.98s)]
*  Yes. [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8925.18s)]
*  So yeah, it's a catch-22. [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8925.82s)]
*  If the real value, if the real expense of what happens to that soil were [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8930.380000000001s)]
*  were experienced by the American taxpayer, I think there'd be a revolt. [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8935.74s)]
*  Well, you know, we're a lazy people. [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8941.58s)]
*  I'm a lazy bastard. [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8943.9s)]
*  Well, the real problem is we have so many people that need food and that we're reliant [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8944.86s)]
*  upon factory farming right now to a large extent because there's enormous populations [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8950.7s)]
*  of people that grow in a place, that live in a place where they grow nothing. [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8957.34s)]
*  Whether it's New York City or it's Los Angeles, it's urban environments. [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8959.98s)]
*  They need food constantly shipped into them and no one's growing anything. [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8963.9s)]
*  And the population keeps booming. [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8967.74s)]
*  And it's like you got to get these people food. [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8969.5s)]
*  And we right now are dependent upon factory farming for a lot of that food. [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8972.22s)]
*  Well, I wonder if you could, through regenerative farming, cover it. [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8978.3s)]
*  I wonder. [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8983.74s)]
*  Could that ultimately be? [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8984.3s)]
*  Yeah, I wonder. [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8985.98s)]
*  I think people are definitely going to have to change the way they eat. [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8986.94s)]
*  It has to change. [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8988.86s)]
*  Well, we at least have to change the way we farm because otherwise we're going to have, [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8990.3s)]
*  you know, just more desertification. [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8996.22s)]
*  But at least people are aware of it now. [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=8999.58s)]
*  At least there's more information and more education about that today than has ever been [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=9002.14s)]
*  before. [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=9007.02s)]
*  I mean, this is never a discussion when I was a kid. [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=9007.5s)]
*  I never heard anything about that. [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=9009.42s)]
*  It was just being done. [[02:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=9010.94s)]
*  And this just you got food and you didn't think about where it came from. [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=9012.22s)]
*  And then the term organic came around like, what's that? [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=9015.34s)]
*  Like, it's no pesticides. [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=9018.22s)]
*  What's pesticides? [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=9019.42s)]
*  What's on the food? [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=9020.62s)]
*  You know, like we didn't know. [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=9021.58s)]
*  And if back then there was no access to any information other than mainstream media. [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=9022.94s)]
*  So it was pretty easy for them to keep going on with these practices without, [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=9028.22s)]
*  unless you went out and sought it out and went and found books or someone told you about a book, [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=9032.62s)]
*  you didn't know. [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=9038.14s)]
*  You didn't get that information. [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=9039.58s)]
*  I think more people have that information now than ever before. [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=9040.78s)]
*  So that's one of the reasons why I'm hopeful. [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=9044.78s)]
*  And I think Bobby really does have an idea of how to do this. [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=9047.82s)]
*  And I hope he's successful. [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=9051.66s)]
*  Me too. [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=9053.5s)]
*  Yeah, me too. [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10&t=9054.460000000001s)]
