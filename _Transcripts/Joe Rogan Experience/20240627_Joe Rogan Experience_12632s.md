# JRE MMA Show #147 with Sean O'Malley & Tim Welch
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day! [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6.0s)]
*  And we're up. Boys, when we did the first one together? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12.0s)]
*  It was like five years ago? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=16.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think it was 2017, right? Or 2018? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=18.0s)]
*  I was two and 0 in the UFC. I was just coming off the Andre Soccer Mom fight where I broke my foot. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=22.0s)]
*  I was 23. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=28.0s)]
*  Yeah, that was just after you broke your foot. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=30.0s)]
*  And now here you are, the fucking champ of the world. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=33.0s)]
*  Living in a dream. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=37.0s)]
*  It's crazy because that whole fight week, I always take a lot of naps fight week, especially because it was on the East Coast and we were trying to stay up late. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=39.0s)]
*  And I would have crazy vivid dreams. Not necessarily about the fight, but just really vivid dreams. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=46.0s)]
*  And so after the fight, I just felt like I was kind of in one of those dreams. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=52.0s)]
*  There's no way that went out, that played out perfect. There's no way that played out literally how I wanted to play out. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=57.0s)]
*  So for a while I kept thinking like I'm going to wake up in my bed and still have to go out there and do that. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=64.0s)]
*  But I haven't woke up from a nap yet, so we're still rolling. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=70.0s)]
*  Well, it makes you wonder what dreams really are. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=73.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=76.0s)]
*  It's so weird that we just accept that we close our eyes every night and scenarios take place that don't really take place. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=77.0s)]
*  And they seem super vivid. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=86.0s)]
*  And then weird things happen to them and then you wake up and you're like, oh, that wasn't real. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=88.0s)]
*  But we just accept that there's many times where I've been in a lucid dream or many times I've been in a dream that felt so real. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=92.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=100.0s)]
*  Like what's going on in our heads? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=101.0s)]
*  Probably a lot during a sober October for you too, because I noticed when I quit smoking weed in camp, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=104.0s)]
*  like when I get closer to the fight, my dreams are so fucking vivid. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=109.0s)]
*  It's kind of scary. It's like a snapshot of another dimension. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=112.0s)]
*  I'm like, could that possibly be us in another dimension witnessing our life play out some other way? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=115.0s)]
*  It could be that what you're doing is like peeking. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=121.0s)]
*  You're like every night you like peek into some other dimension and then pop back up in the morning when you wake up. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=125.0s)]
*  That's one of the theories about DMT. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=132.0s)]
*  It's some sort of a chemical gateway to the next dimension or the next realm of existence. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=134.0s)]
*  And that when the lights go out and then your brain floods with that stuff, your consciousness uses that chemical as a gateway. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=141.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=148.0s)]
*  I've never we've never done DMT. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=149.0s)]
*  I've told myself I want to do like DMT, IOS, that stuff after fighting because right now I have a mindset to I want to be world champ. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=151.0s)]
*  I want to be the greatest. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=158.0s)]
*  I want to kill in the cage. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=159.0s)]
*  I feel like if I do something like that, maybe I switch that around. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=161.0s)]
*  I want to wait. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=164.0s)]
*  Yeah, it might be a problem. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=165.0s)]
*  I'm loving. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=166.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's literally the issue. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=167.0s)]
*  I still have that fucking want to kill. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=169.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's what you're strong Strickland want to kill, but like in the cage dominates. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=172.0s)]
*  Yeah, dominate. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=176.0s)]
*  We're talking to Dana, too. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=177.0s)]
*  He said Cheeto has recently started doing mushrooms when he was training and stuff. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=178.0s)]
*  I wonder if that has anything to do with his performances for Sandhagen and stuff. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=181.0s)]
*  Just look stuck in the mud. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=188.0s)]
*  I think it's just Sandhagen. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=190.0s)]
*  I think Sandhagen was just way faster. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=192.0s)]
*  He's so diverse. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=194.0s)]
*  He's got so much going on. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=196.0s)]
*  I love watching that guy fight because like when he's going after folks, he's given them so many looks. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=197.0s)]
*  There's so much going on and you don't it's there's the patterns are non-existent. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=203.0s)]
*  I'm not sure they exist, but I'm not picking them up. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=209.0s)]
*  There's you know, you think he's going to kick. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=211.0s)]
*  He shoots. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=213.0s)]
*  You think he's going to punch. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=214.0s)]
*  He kicks. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=215.0s)]
*  There's movement to the side. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=216.0s)]
*  You think he's going to engage and he doesn't. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=217.0s)]
*  Yeah, his last three fights, too, he's been really wrestling a lot. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=219.0s)]
*  So you got to think like because I don't know I could fight. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=223.0s)]
*  I mean, there's a couple different people I could fight next. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=226.0s)]
*  But like thinking about fighting Corey, it's like, OK, is he going to be turned into that wrestler? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=228.0s)]
*  Is he going to want to strike or is he going to mix it up? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=232.0s)]
*  I'm assuming, you know, going into a fight with Corey is going to want to mix it up a bit. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=234.0s)]
*  But you just don't know. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=237.0s)]
*  He can do anything. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=239.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=240.0s)]
*  And the fact that he pulled that fight off with a completely torn tricep first round tears the tricep from the bone. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=241.0s)]
*  Needs surgery. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=246.0s)]
*  And I was excited for that fight, too. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=247.0s)]
*  Yeah, me too. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=249.0s)]
*  I watched. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=250.0s)]
*  I mean, I stopped watching at one point. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=251.0s)]
*  I think that was the same night like Jake, Nate. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=252.0s)]
*  So I was kind of flipping back forth. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=254.0s)]
*  But yeah, I was so excited for that fight that was going to be one of those bangers. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=255.0s)]
*  But I mean, he did what he had to do to win. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=260.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=261.0s)]
*  And just super not and wasn't super entertaining. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=262.0s)]
*  Yeah, I was really interested in seeing him fight Umar. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=265.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=269.0s)]
*  That was the interesting one. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=270.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=271.0s)]
*  You know, and when I forgot that was it. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=272.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=274.0s)]
*  Umar Nurmagomedov is a fucking he's a problem. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=275.0s)]
*  I want him to start. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=278.0s)]
*  I mean, he's got the name Nurmagomedov. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=279.0s)]
*  I don't know how many fights he has in the UFC, how many wins he has. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=281.0s)]
*  I've actually never really watched a fight, but I know he's got the name and I know he's fucking super skilled. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=283.0s)]
*  He trains with those guys. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=287.0s)]
*  That could be a huge fight someday. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=289.0s)]
*  I want him to fucking start winning some fights. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=290.0s)]
*  I was excited for him to potentially beat Corey or for Corey to get a win over him. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=292.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=296.0s)]
*  Just to build characters and build like big fights. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=297.0s)]
*  That's what I want. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=299.0s)]
*  I want big fucking fights. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=300.0s)]
*  Well, you're going to bring big fights. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=301.0s)]
*  That's what's so exciting about having someone who's a champ who's such a big personality. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=303.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=307.0s)]
*  And there's so many eyes on the Bantamweight division now. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=308.0s)]
*  You know, the Bantamweight division has always been like just a fucking murderer's row from Henin Burrow, TJ Dillashaw, like across the board, Dominic Cruz, you know, God damn. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=310.0s)]
*  I mean, it's a Cody Garbrandt. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=324.0s)]
*  People like people forget because of Cody's losses, but how good Cody is when he's on. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=326.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=332.0s)]
*  You know, Co is just a guy who's been in a lot of wars. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=333.0s)]
*  You know, seems like he's got just injury issues too, right? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=335.0s)]
*  A lot of injury issues. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=338.0s)]
*  Which sucks. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=339.0s)]
*  I remember after one of my fights, I got injured and he said some people just aren't built for this and that didn't age well for him. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=340.0s)]
*  But I mean, hey, dude, I'm fucking I feel like I'm fragile sometimes too. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=345.0s)]
*  If I didn't start working with Brandon, Brandon Harris, like my strength and conditioning coach and Dan Garner for nutrition, like I feel like I was getting injured all the fucking time. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=349.0s)]
*  Yeah, it sucks. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=355.0s)]
*  This sports brutal. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=356.0s)]
*  It's the most brutal and there's no way to prevent that. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=357.0s)]
*  No, you know, some people are incredible. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=360.0s)]
*  Like Jim Miller. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=362.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=363.0s)]
*  Jim Miller's never had surgery. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=364.0s)]
*  I feel like it's their genes. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=365.0s)]
*  There's gotta be. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=366.0s)]
*  He's got some weird fucking woodsman gene. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=368.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=370.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=371.0s)]
*  Blogger gene. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=372.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=373.0s)]
*  Like a Benson Henderson. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=374.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=375.0s)]
*  There's just so many different paths to make someone a champion. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=376.0s)]
*  There's not just there's this one way you got to do it. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=379.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=381.0s)]
*  No, there's just so many ways. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=382.0s)]
*  Like Sean Strickland sparring all the time and then I fucking literally only spar in camp. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=383.0s)]
*  It's like just two opposite styles, both just one at times. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=388.0s)]
*  It's wild. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=392.0s)]
*  What Sean is doing is so unique because, you know, they put a mouthpiece on him. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=393.0s)]
*  You know, the UFC had some device. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=399.0s)]
*  I think it was a mouthpiece. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=401.0s)]
*  Did they use it with you or they try to figure out how many times you get hit? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=402.0s)]
*  Well, they gave him this thing and they found out that he spars more than all the other fighters in the world. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=404.0s)]
*  He spars more than all the other fighters they tested and he gets hit less than all the other fighters they tested. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=411.0s)]
*  He gets hit less than anybody, which is amazing. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=416.0s)]
*  But it's the timing is his distance control. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=419.0s)]
*  He's like so tuned in to the idea of hitting a person, not just hitting a bag, not just doing drills, but all of his moves, all of his movements when he's training are hitting people. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=422.0s)]
*  I wonder how many of his sparring partners are like, I don't even want to fucking hit him because he's just going to turn it up and it's going to be a full fight. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=434.0s)]
*  Because there's guys you spar with and it's like, OK, if I hit this dude, we're going to fight. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=440.0s)]
*  He's just there. There's no. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=445.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. So I wonder how many of those guys know going into sparring like, OK, if I even hit him, it's going to turn into something. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=446.0s)]
*  I might as well just kind of play around for five minutes, get to the next guy. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=450.0s)]
*  I'm sure. But I mean, you look at the guy, he's got talented guys he trains with. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=454.0s)]
*  Yes, Curtis, Chris Curtis, talented and really Chris Curtis, really talented in the pocket. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=458.0s)]
*  You know, he's really good at like ripping the body is a boxing excellence, got really good defense. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=463.0s)]
*  So him and Sean together, I mean, that's like just two sad. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=469.0s)]
*  Yeah, just good boxers to and strictly solid boxer strictly just doesn't switch stances at all. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=472.0s)]
*  Just orthodox the whole time. Man, it's fucking sweet to watch. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=479.0s)]
*  And dude, his leg checks, the checks from those kicks was so on point. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=483.0s)]
*  Yeah, that was impressive. None of them snuck in. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=487.0s)]
*  The best at that at all time from of all time of sneaking kicks in his paeda. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=489.0s)]
*  So scary. Yeah, it doesn't like make sense the way it doesn't. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=494.0s)]
*  It's just like his shin moves. Nothing else. Yeah. Wild. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=498.0s)]
*  He keeps his shoulders completely square and you do not see it coming. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=501.0s)]
*  So he sacrifices. I mean, but he's got so much power. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=506.0s)]
*  He can sacrifice some power and it doesn't matter. He's just doing numbers on that calf. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=509.0s)]
*  Yeah. And is his leg was fucked after the first round of second fight. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=513.0s)]
*  You could tell I can't. That's crazy. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=517.0s)]
*  They just added that to the co-main event for John Jones and Stipe because neither of them are champions. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=519.0s)]
*  So they're going to stack that fucking card and only have to pay out John Jones because he's the champion for pay-per-view. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=524.0s)]
*  Oh, that's why they think it like a businessman. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=529.0s)]
*  The champ thinks like a businessman. I've been thinking like a businessman. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=532.0s)]
*  I've been I feel like I've been champ for a long time. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=536.0s)]
*  Just find the official. But yeah, I know that that card is going to be fucking sweet. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=538.0s)]
*  Who else is on that card? I know. I think I think there's another another banger on that card. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=542.0s)]
*  Yeah, they always try to stack New York City. Yeah. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=548.0s)]
*  That Madison Square Garden card is special. There's something special about that arena. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=551.0s)]
*  That arena gives you goosebumps just walking in. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=555.0s)]
*  You're like, God damn. That TD Garden was fucking crazy because I my first like nine fights in the UFC were all in Vegas, Vegas, Vegas, Vegas. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=558.0s)]
*  And then I fought in Abu Dhabi and then we went to Boston. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=565.0s)]
*  So the first time fighting somewhere other than Vegas in the United States. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=568.0s)]
*  Yeah. So those are the two big ones. And scroll down, see the rest of it. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=572.0s)]
*  Jessica on Jaraj, Mackenzie Durn. That's a good fight. OK, some decents, but not Jared Gordon, Mark Madsen. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=575.0s)]
*  That's a good fight match. No. Yeah, I thought there was more bangers. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=580.0s)]
*  Sometimes they have a nice prelim, nice main event. What's the prelim? Go to the ESPN. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=583.0s)]
*  Mackenzie Durn, Jiggly. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=588.0s)]
*  It would be right here. This just shows the fights. OK, so that that's what makes sense because this doesn't look like the actual order because here we're talking in September. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=590.0s)]
*  And I believe those are the that's the main, the co-main and probably maybe the fight before that. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=597.0s)]
*  But they might move all this shit. Yeah. Yeah. This is just the announced fight. Yeah. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=602.0s)]
*  OK, that makes sense. Well, I don't think it would open up the pay-per-view with these matchups. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=606.0s)]
*  I guess so. It's not even October yet. So right. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=610.0s)]
*  I'm very interested to see how much steep he's got left in the tank. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=612.0s)]
*  You know, one of the things I really like is that he spent all this time off so he hasn't been hit. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=617.0s)]
*  He you know, no punishments, no wars, no chaos. He's been two solid years of recovery. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=622.0s)]
*  That's huge. It's big. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=628.0s)]
*  Even if he wasn't training crazy, but his body was able to kind of recover, I feel like there's so much into that than just being training, training, training, training and fucking busting yourself down. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=631.0s)]
*  I mean, it was just never take anything away from D.C. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=640.0s)]
*  But I've often wondered if that KO, if some of that KO was him coming off of that fight with Francis, because if you go watch that first round of that fight with Francis, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=643.0s)]
*  Jesus, Louisa's I mean, Francis hit him with some meteors. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=654.0s)]
*  He's so fucking he just opened up the gas tank too much and ran dry. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=659.0s)]
*  But he wasn't patient. He was just trying to take him out, just winging wild and burned off all his energy. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=664.0s)]
*  But Stipe took some shots. He took some fucking shots. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=669.0s)]
*  Yeah, Stipe for some of those wrestling scrambles. And that just zapped Francis. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=673.0s)]
*  I think that Stipe, John Jones fights can be more competitive than people think. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=677.0s)]
*  Well, the real question is, you know, what is it like when John fights a legit heavyweight that can do everything? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=681.0s)]
*  Yeah. Right. Because Stipe is not just like Cyril Gahn is a fantastic striker. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=689.0s)]
*  I mean, he's one of the most beautiful strikers in the heavyweight division. I love watching that guy move. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=694.0s)]
*  He does wild stuff. You see how he throws that front kick from a side stance and he throws it like a twisting kick. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=698.0s)]
*  He doesn't throw the front. He stands like Southpaw, right? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=706.0s)]
*  And he bobs around like this and he's totally sideways and he twists his foot out. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=709.0s)]
*  Oh, they'll show it there. Oh, let's see. He twists his foot out like a twisting kick. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=715.0s)]
*  They show the front kicks to the body if he does any. He did a lot of them against Taitui Vasa. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=720.0s)]
*  Yeah, I thought him versus John Jones was going to be a fucking crazy like war. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=725.0s)]
*  He's kickboxing, but John's just so much better at wrestling. So much better grappler. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=729.0s)]
*  He's so fast, man. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=734.0s)]
*  Diluc, that's crazy to think because Diluc look good last fight, right? The knee, he looks skinny, looked in shape. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=736.0s)]
*  But he just doesn't have the kicking acumen. It's not his style. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=743.0s)]
*  If you could find the ones that's him throwing kicks with, he just does this weird thing where he stands sideways. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=748.0s)]
*  And instead of the front kick going like this, like straight out, the front kick goes like this. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=756.0s)]
*  So his knee when he lands is almost like sideways. He did a lot. Oh, that was a Tui Vasa fight. That was a crazy fight. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=762.0s)]
*  Tais only like 32 or something, wasn't he? Oh my God. I thought that fucker was. He's 85 in war games. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=772.0s)]
*  Especially with the boos. Oh yeah, the boos and the war. He's just an animal, man. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=778.0s)]
*  Hopefully they'll show it. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=783.0s)]
*  He kept stabbing him with this front kick. This is the combination. Oh my God, he was good. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=788.0s)]
*  He's just so unusual for a heavyweight, that kind of movement. There he is. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=798.0s)]
*  That was more like a front kick, that was definitely more like a front kick. But he'll show it totally sideways. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=804.0s)]
*  It's a little trick. Almost like a crescent kick or something like that. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=812.0s)]
*  Which people are starting to do now too. I forget this dude's name, but one guy knocked a guy out in an MMA fight with an inside crescent kick. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=816.0s)]
*  And I was like, I was always wondering. I was always wondering if someone was going to be able to pull that off. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=823.0s)]
*  Where you're standing like this and you go like that. Yeah, you do it like this way. Yeah. It's just so hard to pull off. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=828.0s)]
*  You know, you're moving around. Anderson tried it a few times. Yeah. I'll throw an X. I'll throw an X, right? [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=833.0s)]
*  Check this out. That's nasty. Think? That looked fucking weird. I shouted out that dude on Instagram when it happened. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=838.0s)]
*  But what is his name, Jamie? Justin Berry. Show that one more time. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=844.0s)]
*  Because from where he's standing, you kind of feel like you're safe. Oh, I was right to the fucking shin. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=850.0s)]
*  Right, so you see how his foot is in the center, right? So watch how he stands. He's kind of out of place, you would think, to kick you in the face. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=856.0s)]
*  Well, even to do the right defense, he's throwing a right teep. You're going to use your right hand. So you're going to leave that exposed. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=865.0s)]
*  It's pretty wicked. I mean, it's tricky for sure. But it's wicked. Look at how it worked. I mean, my God, that's crazy. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=871.0s)]
*  And he did not see that coming. I'll throw that up next fight. Let's go. Let's go. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=876.0s)]
*  So the next fight is not officially announced, but you believe it'll be Cheeto. I want it to be Cheeto. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=884.0s)]
*  I want it to be Cheeto. I called that before the fight. Once they announced that, well, Cheeto was supposed to fight Henry on my card. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=889.0s)]
*  So I was like, I want the winner of that. I want Cheeto versus Henry. I want the winner of that if I go out there and do what I do against Aljo. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=894.0s)]
*  Henry pulled out, Pedro stepped up, and I was like, well, if Cheeto wins, it makes sense. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=900.0s)]
*  So that's what I want. Why has Pure Yarn been on the shelf? He's just got announced Songyi Dong. Oh, when's that? [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=906.0s)]
*  I think that's sooner than later, actually. But that's fucked, Peter, because songs and it's a problem. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=913.0s)]
*  That was another great fight with we went to see the Sanhagen Songyi Dong fight at the Apex, which is incredible. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=919.0s)]
*  Yeah. Have you gone to the Apex just to watch a fight? We watched the Contender series there once. It was fucking cool. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=926.0s)]
*  I was thinking about flying out last weekend for Fuzzy versus Gamera. I was like, where was that at? Oh, Baguette. That was at the Apex, which is the best place to see fights, man. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=932.0s)]
*  I hate the small cage. I hate it. Big difference, right? I'll probably never. Well, I guess it's at the Apex. I'll never fight in a small cage again. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=942.0s)]
*  It doesn't help my style. I like being able to move around as much as possible. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=952.0s)]
*  That's why I'm confused. Why? Why have a small cage when you own the arena? They had a small cage back when we used to do the Pearl of the Palms, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=958.0s)]
*  because it was a smaller place to put the stage. So they will just make the cage. What is it like? 30% smaller? 44 or something like that. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=967.0s)]
*  Almost. Yeah, it's like it's damn near 50%. It's crazy. It feels like it. It fucking feels like it. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=974.0s)]
*  I remember when Corey fought Aljo in the small cage and then I brought I said something about not wanting to fight in a small cage. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=980.0s)]
*  And I don't think Corey should either because of the style. And then Corey's like, oh, that's just your insecurity. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=988.0s)]
*  And I'm like, dude, you got fucking choked out 14 seconds. I'll do. Yeah, there it is. 44. Yeah. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=992.0s)]
*  I think they said the lighting wasn't set up. They didn't put the right lighting for the big cage. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=997.0s)]
*  Hey, guess what? You're the UFC. You're a building. Guess what? You guys fucking for no reason decided to build your own arena. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1001.0s)]
*  I'm getting a fucking full size octagon. I'm building a warehouse on my property right now. I'm getting a full size octagon. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1008.0s)]
*  Because I mean, at Tim's gym at the MMA lab, pretty much any gym you go to, they all have smaller gyms or smaller cages in there. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1013.0s)]
*  And just even sparring, it's like just it's just different. It's like playing if you're going to be in the NBA and you're playing half court. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1020.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's just different. Well, I've been advocating for no cage for a long time. I would be unbeatable and there was this Russian promotion that we were just watching from back in the day with Egor Vovchanchin. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1027.0s)]
*  And he was fighting some dude and it was just this big round platform. Jesus. And it was just flat. And there was no. And you see everything. That's sweet. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1038.0s)]
*  The every the fucking eyesight like there's not a bad eye line in the house because everybody's seeing the fight. There's no polls that are blocking the way. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1048.0s)]
*  Sometimes that called what promotion? I don't know. This is in the 90s. Power man. 1996. Mr. Power. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1057.0s)]
*  And Votanchin too. Yeah. Show it. Show it. See what it looks like. Jim. It's pretty dope. And that's my dream. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1064.0s)]
*  My dream is no cage because I think the cage is just too many elements. There's too much going on. So look at this. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1071.0s)]
*  So there's just like a little barrier on the outside. This is only one of them that they did. Oh, yeah. That's one that they did. Another one that they did was like completely flat. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1077.0s)]
*  Egor was a fucking animal. That's when he was smaller. Five eight heavyweight. No way. Yeah. Jesus. TKO Mark Kerr has a five eight heavyweight. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1088.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. See the cage is like that's the best. Isn't that way better? And look how much size you would have to move around. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1099.0s)]
*  Obviously wouldn't have that bullshit floor. Floor looks like the moment you sweat. You're tearing an ACL. That floor looks terrible. Yeah. God, that floor sucks. It does. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1107.0s)]
*  It does. It sucks so bad. It's it's loose. It's everything. I hate when I go to a jujitsu gym and they have like homemade mats. So they have like the loose stuff. Yeah. Like saggy tape mat. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1117.0s)]
*  Like what do you guys hate? Grip? Do you guys hate like foot positioning and like slipping around on all that shit? Yeah. No cage or change. Change everything. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1128.0s)]
*  I feel like the only chance people I could get they take it down in the open. But I feel like it's going to be a lot harder than to push me up against the cage. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1140.0s)]
*  And I mean, that's what Al Jowell's 100 percent goal was pushing up against the cage. Take me down work from there. But there's no fucking cage. What's your fucking game plan? [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1149.0s)]
*  Also, how much fewer clinches would there be? Yeah. Would be a huge factor because how many clinches take place in that weird danger zone when you're right up against the cage? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1156.0s)]
*  Just grab this motherfucker. It's just there's so many moments where guys are like what you know, they're trying to reset and they go in for the clinch. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1166.0s)]
*  That shit would not be available if there's no cage. If you have this big ass basketball size circle in the middle of an arena and that's where the guys are fighting. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1173.0s)]
*  That would be incredible. It'd be incredible. It's really the way to do it. Yeah. Something about the cage makes it like badass. I don't know what it is. Yeah. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1183.0s)]
*  Pitbulls and glitter. Yeah. The old affliction shirts. Yeah. The dragon fucking a pitbull in the ass. Yeah. With Japanese littering. The old school real gangster shit. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1192.0s)]
*  I love those shirts. Yeah. Fighting in Japan would be fucking crazy. Yeah. Fighting in Japan, if you're like a world champion, that's like a mecha place, right? [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1203.0s)]
*  You know, if you want to fight in Madison Square Garden, but fighting in Tokyo as a martial artist. That would be crazy. Saitama Super Arena, right? Oh my God. I wonder if the UFC's never done that, right? [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1216.0s)]
*  We did an arena in Japan. I commented that it was in Tokyo a few years back. It's amazing. They're so knowledgeable and they're also they applaud when things happen, like when someone passes the guard. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1230.0s)]
*  They get it. Yeah. I wonder why Dana or any of them haven't looked into yellow cards. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1242.0s)]
*  Where your purse gets taken from you. Well, the problem with that is it's so subjective, right? Like, let's look at this Valentina Shevchenko Alexa Grasso rematch where one judge scores the final round, a pivotal fight round. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1249.0s)]
*  It's like that's what makes the fight. One judge scores a 10-8. No one agrees with him. Literally. No one agrees with him. Like, what the fuck? Because if he didn't score a 10-8 and he just scored a 10-9. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1264.0s)]
*  Then Valentina wins. I went back and watched it just once, but I was kind of surfing on my phone. I thought Grasso won three out of the five rounds. But I also, like I said, I was surfing a little bit on my phone. Yeah, it's hard. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1273.0s)]
*  It's hard to casually watch a fight. Yeah, you got to fucking. Yeah, I like watching fights with like Eddie Bravo taught me how to do this because Eddie Bravo at one point in time was doing the Max Kellerman, not Max Kellerman. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1284.0s)]
*  Who's that dude that Letterman that does it on Harold Letterman? He's doing on HBO fights where in between around I gave that round to Davis 10-8 and this is what he would give like an explanation for what he thought. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1296.0s)]
*  So he was basically like an independent scorekeeper. So Eddie would do that. And he would say we did it for a few UFC's where he would come in and he would talk about like we're going to Eddie Bravo with what he thinks happened score wise. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1308.0s)]
*  And he would take a piece of paper and he would have two sides like one side would be this guy. One side would be that guy. And he would write on the on the lines like kicks, punches, takedowns, power, like power shots. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1321.0s)]
*  I forget all of his criteria. So as he's watching the fight, he's writing things. So it's not just going on memory. I think he got more. And he also had access to whatever stats we had at the time. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1334.0s)]
*  Although I don't think we had the kind of stats you have now where you're now you're getting constantly updated on significant strikes. What is a significant? [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1346.0s)]
*  That's a that was a weird one in Izzy and Strickland. Right. Yes, they were showing that that you know that there's one point where Izzy had landed more significant strikes. I'm like, but to where? Like what? Yeah, is a significant strike is like a leg kick that gets checked. Are you calling that a significant strike? [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1355.0s)]
*  Like what is if a guy lifts his leg up and like, yeah, he did get kicked hard. But like, what is it? Here's Eddie Bravo's Randy Silver or Tim Silver and Randy Couture. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1375.0s)]
*  I think that was a good thing to do. It was also it's also a good thing to put the fucking the the actual judges on blast. I agree. Because like when DC and I are doing commentary, you can't do commentary and score a fight. You can kind of like have an idea. But you're trying to be entertaining. You're trying to like give life to the fight. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1386.0s)]
*  You're trying to give life to the to what's happening. And you're just reacting like, oh, you want to scream and swear and you just I'm doing my best to not. But you can't do you should be quiet, just quiet and thinking about it. And you should also have access to replays. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1415.0s)]
*  Should you be in like that closer? Should you be on a monitor where you see different angles in a bill in a room like this? I think they have monitors now. They didn't used to have monitors, which is great. The refs stand in there sometimes with a poll. I guess not a poll here. A judge. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1431.0s)]
*  I don't think they'd listen, though, like I don't think they listen to commentary. It's pretty good, which is probably good because commentary could definitely influence it. Like it's someone DC trains with. And it's so crazy, though, if you're yeah, if you're a judge and you never felt a checked kick. Because when I fought Pedro, I swear, like, I felt his foot land on my shin. And like, I felt I felt like I was fucking him up when he was kicking me. And then the judges obviously gave him the first round. He didn't punch me in the face once. I had more significant strikes. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1445.0s)]
*  But he was landing leg kick. I was checking them. I feel like I fucked his feet up from checking kicks. And they gave him the round, which but it's just like they probably never checked a kick or threw a kick in their life. So it doesn't. But these guys are making this such an important decision. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1475.0s)]
*  Yeah, Chris Liebman. He's making his Nevada judging debut. I mean, I think he already did. And he's already been a referee. He's been a referee for quite a while now. He's doing. Did he make his debut last fight? Or is he going to? [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1491.0s)]
*  No, he did. Yeah, last weekend. Oh, OK. On the fight card. Yeah. That's right. A lot of pressure on everyone. Look at it like, well, how'd you score it? Right. Yeah. And there's some crazy stories about Liebman back in the day. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1504.0s)]
*  Oh, he's a wild man. Just getting fucked up the night before fights. Yeah. Yeah. Being drunk at the casino, the slots and stuff. Robert Falls would tell me and then go out and win. He could crack though. Fuck. Yeah. He cracked. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1515.0s)]
*  Remember when he knocked out Vandeley? Oh, yeah. Oh, shit. Chris Liebman had a hammer of a left hand. I mean, a hammer, especially when he was hurt. Yeah. There's some guys that just fucking have just some kind of stupid fucking power. You know, there's some Paul Daly dudes out there that just. Yeah. He's fun to watch. He's interesting because he's orthodox left handed. Right. Yes. Yeah. So that's right. He throws a fucking crazy left hand. That's fun to watch. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1530.0s)]
*  Yeah. He's I hope Michael Venom paid it comes to see I know there's a lot of talks and I believe they're going to get that. That would be make that division so interesting. Oh, yeah. He's so handful. He's so difficult because like that style. And I always said that that was going to be the next that's going to be the next factor in MMA is these point karate guys. Like one of these point karate guys really figures out everything else. They become dedicated to become an actual MMA fighter. That's blitz thing that they do. Yeah. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1560.0s)]
*  It's so different. It's so hard to deal with. Well, that's going to be interesting. Stephen Thompson versus Shavkat. That's going to be fun to watch. That is going to be fun to watch. But Shavkat can grapple too. Yeah. Shavkat's a lot. That motherfucking can do everything. I watched a documentary on him recently. Like his come up from when he turned pro. Like the second he turned pro he was fighting like good, good guys. First prize, second, third. He didn't have any easy fights. Yeah. He was fighting fucking killers. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1590.0s)]
*  He's interesting. I wonder how many people the UFC's already. I mean, I don't know if they can be in talks, but because Bellator is going away. Right. Yeah. Well, they're going to merge with the PFL allegedly. Apparently. I read some thing from Chaudry. One of C. Apparently they offered them Bellator to and they were at point one point considering it, I guess. But Dana White was like, what do you get? I saw that. Right. The thing is, he's right. Yeah. Here's the thing. There's no pay per view. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1620.0s)]
*  Maybe they can develop a pay per view model, but you need stars. And the UFC has always had stars. The UFC is always going to have pay per views and we can't wait to watch them. It's not like convincing someone. You know, like this, this fight, like Yuri Prohaska, Alex Paheda, John Jones and Stevie. Take my money. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1650.0s)]
*  Even that December card that's coming together. Fucking Tony Ferguson, Patty. Fucking I think that's Steven Thompson, Rock Knot, Leon Edwards, Colby Covington, Brandon Royval versus Pantosha. Oh, that's right. That's on that card too. Yeah. Oh my God. Man. Tony Ferg, though. Six fight, lose and treat. Six. I know. Crazy. I feel like it's the lose lose for Patty because even if he wins, it's like Tony's fuck still dangerous, but he's not going to get the credit. You know, Tony. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1668.0s)]
*  He looked good in his last fight. He looked good. I mean, he didn't look like the Tony of old. What do you fight again? Um, didn't he fight Bobby Green? Yeah, that's right. Yeah. And Bobby Green's a motherfucker. Well, even Tony versus Michael Chandler. Well, Tony wasn't looking too bad until he ate that fucking heel or that. Go back to that card, Jimmy, please. That, look at that. Vicente, Luca. Vicente, Luca versus Ian Machado, Gary's are crazy. And they trained at the same gym. So I wonder how much they sparred. Oh, they probably sparred a ton. Yeah. God, sparring and fighting though are so fucking different. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1698.0s)]
*  At least for me, I feel like, cause when I spar, it's like I crack people and I hurt them and it changes the fight. But in sparring, it's like, I'm not necessarily trying to fucking crack you. So it's like sparring is going to play out way different than if it was a fight. Right. And depends on how you spar though. But I feel like it's just such different sport for KO artists. Yeah. For KO artists. Yeah. But for like volume guys. Yeah, that's probably pretty true. Or it's probably super similar. Sparring, like that's where you get, that's where I get injured. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1728.0s)]
*  Like for the most part, just sparring. It's not usually too bad. Like it's, I kick someone's fucking elbow last six weeks before my last fight and my fucking left toe, I have a turf toe and it still fucking hurts just from kicking an elbow hardest. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1758.0s)]
*  Cause I'll throw up teeps and body shots as hard as you can in sparring. Like you're going to be all right. So I whipped a fucking teep and landed on an elbow and I fucking swear my foot, my toe turned the other way. It didn't, but that shit still hurts to today. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1773.0s)]
*  You remember John Jones versus Chael Sonnen. He still has to tape his toes up. I believe it. He has to tape his big toe to his little toe just to hold it in place while he fucks people up. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1784.0s)]
*  That sounds fucking funny. It's funny. I gotta tape my toes before I fuck you up. But he has to otherwise it's just like, it's so torn apart that I guess it just doesn't hold anymore. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1792.0s)]
*  That was the first fight you didn't wrap your ankles against Al Jow, right? We weren't allowed to in Boston. But yeah, I didn't wrap them. I didn't feel like I needed to. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1805.0s)]
*  I didn't feel like I needed to either. Like I felt my shit was good, but usually I like to get a little fucking. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1813.0s)]
*  And that probably gives him grip on his single legs and stuff. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1818.0s)]
*  Yeah, before the fight you're like, hey, let's not even give him that even that little bit. Cause wrestling, like I'll grapple or wrestle with really fucking high level wrestlers. We have so many fucking good guys we train with. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1821.0s)]
*  Get in on a single leg, a limp leg out. But wrestlers are used to being able to, you know, when someone cried a limp leg or used that shoe to kind of hold on. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1831.0s)]
*  And fighting, I mean, unless you have your ankles wrapped. Who was the fight? I think it was Luque versus RDA. In between rounds, I took off his ankle wraps. Did that happen? [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1838.0s)]
*  I think, yeah, I think it was right before we fought Al Jow too. Took off the ankle wraps because he was using it as a little grip. Even that little tiny advantage. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1848.0s)]
*  It makes a difference. It makes a difference. You know, like Eddie Bravo used to always say, like you wear as much as you can on your legs. It'll make your guard more dangerous. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1858.0s)]
*  Like in jujitsu tournaments. Like, and in fighting, like Frank Mir used to try to wear these long ass knee sleeves. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1868.0s)]
*  Like if you could wear long knee sleeves and shorts. Another couple guys did. George Sotteropolis did that. He basically almost had pants on. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1874.0s)]
*  Like you had knee sleeves and then above the knee sleeves he had like tights where the shorts were. So there's so much friction. And that would aid you. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1882.0s)]
*  And so if you've got that shit on your ankles, for sure that's going to aid a guy grabbing your ankle. Even if it's just for that minor adjustment. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1891.0s)]
*  Fuck. I was worried about that fight. I was like, this motherfucker's. Even against like Peter Yon, I was like, okay, fucking, I can beat this dude. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1898.0s)]
*  But I knew I could beat Aljo too, but I was like, this dude's fucking dangerous. Like he's fucking, especially the tear he's been on just beat Henry Suhuto. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1909.0s)]
*  So the dude's fucking in his prime. Like this motherfucker's dangerous. And to choke to choke Sanhagen out the way he did. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1917.0s)]
*  That was, that was one of my, like when you think about fights going good or bad, I want to think about bad, especially when you've seen it happen. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1924.0s)]
*  Like you know he can do that. He just, he did it recently. So I'm like, I just don't want to get embarrassed and just be that guy. I just don't want. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1932.0s)]
*  Corey's got to live with that forever. And that sucks. I mean, he's, I mean, obviously we all know what good Corey is and like that probably wouldn't happen again, but it doesn't matter if it would or wouldn't happen again. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1941.0s)]
*  It fucking happened. I think sometimes when things like that happen, it just changes your approach to fighting and steals your mind. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1951.0s)]
*  And I think that's what it did with him. And he just became way better. Yeah. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1958.0s)]
*  It's the kid Corey Sanhagen that we think of now, like the guy wheel kicked Marlon Marais. Yeah. Like that's a different Corey. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1961.0s)]
*  Frank Yedgerney. Frank Yedgerney. That's one of the nasties. He's an animal now. He's a fucking animal. He's just, he flows in there. You know, but like that fight, like, and yeah, it's crazy. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1967.0s)]
*  It's crazy. Like Marlon Marais, dude. And one point in time, Marlon Marais was the motherfucker for like this long. It's all you get sometimes. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1979.0s)]
*  He was so big for the division and fucking super jacked and his striking was nasty. And when he knocked out Aljo with that switch kick, his left high kick off the switch was beautiful. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=1988.0s)]
*  Aljo shot into his knee. That's right. Yeah. He shot into his knee. Oh, thought he was dead. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2001.0s)]
*  You know what's funny is I was actually at that fight and I was, I don't know where I was at in my career, but I think I was only one fight in maybe. But I was at that fight and watched that. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2006.0s)]
*  And I hadn't really been to fights before. And I was just watching the stands as like just a normal fucking, wasn't sitting in the UFC section. I was just, I was like, oh fuck. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2015.0s)]
*  I thought I'd, he was out for five, 10 million. It was scary. That's always a scary ones right when someone's running in and then the other guy catches them with a knee or a kick like fucking Cyborg and Michael Venn and Page. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2024.0s)]
*  Oh, that's gross. Oh, that was the worst one ever. That makes you question, that makes you question, do I still want to do this? People don't know what we're talking about. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2036.0s)]
*  Michael Venn and Page, we were just talking about earlier, who's just so phenomenal, caught this guy Cyborg, not Cyborg that you think of like Chris Cyborg, but her husband. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2044.0s)]
*  He's also Cyborg, which must have been a confusing household. Oh, god damn. And he crushed his skull. So his, with that, like him moving in and that knee landing perfectly. The pain he was in. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2053.0s)]
*  He literally fractured the front of his skull and they had to have it, look he's got a dent in his skull. Look at his whole, look how shattered it was. That's insane. That looks like a video game type shit. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2067.0s)]
*  Insane. Now also, also what does that do to your brain? Yeah, that's not good. Like what's going on in there? And he was like, I'll be back and everybody's like, dude, hang on. Fuck. I think that might be a wrap. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2079.0s)]
*  Yeah, especially if you have kids. Like I know once I had a baby, I'm like, you think a little bit different. He's like, okay. Well, that's why you can't do ayahuasca. Not yet. You think of everybody as you. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2090.0s)]
*  Yeah. Fuck. Yeah, just chew Adderall and punch people. I've never, I've never done, well I think I might have done Adderall once. I've never done it. But I'm like, I don't really need to. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Tim always tries to get me doing it. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2100.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Oh my God. He went right into that. That was a crazy one. Yeah. And now he went on like a fucking eight fight losing streak too, didn't he? Yeah. You know what happened? Henry. Yeah. Got him in that second round. And that is in a go to the first round. See if you can find Marlon Marais versus Henry Cejudo round one. Just find the fight and we'll watch though. So the first round, Marlon is fucking Henry's legs up. Yeah. I mean, he's just looks incredible. He looks like a world champion. More like a [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2114.0s)]
*  tie fighter. Yeah. And then Henry made the adjustments. And so I'm gassed the fuck out. Yeah. But dude, he looks so good. It's just Marlon couldn't keep up the pace. And I often wondered, I wonder how much of it had to do with Marlon cutting weight because he was so big. Yeah. Like that guy never looked like 135 pounder. He always looked like a featherweight. God, he's just so short though for the division too. For Benton weight. I mean, I guess not short for the division. But he's a little bit shorter. Yeah. He's a little bit shorter. Yeah. He's a little bit shorter. Yeah. He's a little bit shorter. Yeah. He's a little bit shorter. Yeah. He's a little bit shorter. Yeah. He's a little bit shorter. Yeah. He's a little bit shorter. Yeah. He's a little bit shorter. Yeah. He's a little bit shorter. Yeah. He's a little bit shorter. Yeah. He's a [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2144.0s)]
*  little bit shorter. Yeah. He's a little bit shorter. Yeah. He's a little bit shorter. Yeah. He's a little bit shorter. So I mean, um, I mean, when he was playing hooks and 민주 wasograms and possession executed to the knee and, and he was just not too great. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2174.0s)]
*  throw kicks and Habib, remember that video? [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2186.16s)]
*  Yeah, I've never seen that. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2189.2799999999997s)]
*  He was trying to teach Habib something [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2190.6s)]
*  and he was like landing a kick with his foot [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2192.6s)]
*  on Habib's knee and Habib was like, [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2194.56s)]
*  what are you doing here? [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2197.2799999999997s)]
*  It was funny. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2198.3199999999997s)]
*  But yeah, I remember watching this fight, [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2200.56s)]
*  cause I didn't know if I was gonna fight Henry or Aljo. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2202.12s)]
*  I was kind of preparing for both. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2204.44s)]
*  So I was watching, I remember watching this fight back [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2206.2999999999997s)]
*  thinking like, fuck, he made some good adjustments. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2208.3199999999997s)]
*  There was a good leg kick by Henry there, [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2211.3399999999997s)]
*  but Marlin caught him with some great counters. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2213.24s)]
*  Look at that right there. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2215.7200000000003s)]
*  Just look at that counter left [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2217.36s)]
*  and then the right hand over the top. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2218.6800000000003s)]
*  The left body kick, sharp. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2220.12s)]
*  And then starting to really put it on Henry [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2222.28s)]
*  when these exchanges, like every one of these exchanges, [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2225.08s)]
*  he's the guy who's getting off the harder shot [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2228.04s)]
*  and that fucking switch kick he does is so pretty. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2229.8s)]
*  That switch kick off the left leg, [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2232.7000000000003s)]
*  if you got a fast one, like an Edson Barbosa one, [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2234.4s)]
*  it's such a dangerous weapon. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2237.84s)]
*  I never saw anybody throw it faster than Barbosa. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2240.36s)]
*  Yeah, dude, it's fucking slick. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2242.42s)]
*  He's at 45 now, right? [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2244.5s)]
*  Yeah. Isn't that weird? [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2246.34s)]
*  It is weird, yeah. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2247.18s)]
*  I don't like when people go down like that. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2248.46s)]
*  It's hard. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2249.94s)]
*  It's like Frankie when he went down later in his career, [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2251.02s)]
*  BJ went down, it's just like. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2254.5s)]
*  Cubs wants him to try to go with 35 for one fight too. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2256.34s)]
*  Yeah, it just crushes you. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2259.7400000000002s)]
*  And especially as you get older, [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2261.26s)]
*  I think it's even more punishing [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2262.7400000000002s)]
*  and more difficult to come back 24 hours [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2264.26s)]
*  after such a brutal weight cut and fight. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2266.7s)]
*  Those weight cuts are not fucking good for you. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2268.86s)]
*  Remember not long ago, [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2270.62s)]
*  remember the commissions would start at 24 hours [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2272.5s)]
*  before the event would start? [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2275.1s)]
*  That was right before I got in the UFC. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2276.98s)]
*  I'm so fucking glad they changed that [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2278.2200000000003s)]
*  and we could weigh in at 9 a.m. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2280.46s)]
*  It's a game changer. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2281.54s)]
*  Yeah, it's a change. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2282.58s)]
*  Well, really what they should figure out how to do [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2283.86s)]
*  is not have weight cutting. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2287.5s)]
*  Really, the best thing to do [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2289.46s)]
*  would be to have more weight classes [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2291.1s)]
*  and to have just eliminate that whole bullshit. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2293.54s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2297.98s)]
*  I wonder what Aljo would fight at then [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2298.82s)]
*  because like we were talking about earlier, [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2300.42s)]
*  the motherfucker gets up to 170 pounds. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2302.34s)]
*  I bet he'd fight at 165. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2305.1400000000003s)]
*  165, that's crazy. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2306.58s)]
*  That's what I think he would fight at. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2308.58s)]
*  I think that would. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2309.86s)]
*  He'd fight at 155. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2310.7000000000003s)]
*  Actual 165 pound guys. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2311.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2313.7000000000003s)]
*  Look, I mean, I'm not disparaging anybody doing it [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2314.54s)]
*  because it's part of the sport, [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2316.7000000000003s)]
*  but it's sanctioned cheating. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2317.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2319.5s)]
*  So it is, you're not really 135 pounds. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2320.34s)]
*  Like Aljo's not 135 pounds. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2322.7400000000002s)]
*  I do find advantages in there [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2324.94s)]
*  because I know I'm doing it right. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2327.6200000000003s)]
*  I know I'm doing it as scientific, [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2328.78s)]
*  as healthy as possible [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2331.02s)]
*  and as disciplined as I possibly can [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2332.86s)]
*  where I know other guys aren't. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2334.62s)]
*  Like I don't think Aljo did his weight cut better than I did [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2336.66s)]
*  and the rehydration. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2340.1s)]
*  I have the team around me [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2341.14s)]
*  to fucking make sure we're doing it perfect [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2342.5s)]
*  to where I don't think a lot of fighters are. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2344.34s)]
*  They're just doing it. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2345.7400000000002s)]
*  I know how to make way. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2346.58s)]
*  I'm gonna fucking get it off [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2347.42s)]
*  and I'm gonna fucking just. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2348.34s)]
*  How much of a relief is it for you [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2350.9s)]
*  when that's over, the camp's over, the fight's over, [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2352.94s)]
*  then you just, how long do you just eat [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2355.18s)]
*  whatever the fuck you want? [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2356.78s)]
*  Well, yeah, in camp. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2358.7400000000002s)]
*  We just had Terry Black's barbecue. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2359.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, no, I definitely, [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2361.42s)]
*  especially when I'm traveling, [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2362.9s)]
*  it's not like if we're traveling, I'll get a cheeseburger. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2363.98s)]
*  I'll fucking not be super disciplined. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2366.98s)]
*  But when I go back home, I try to still keep it clean. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2369.46s)]
*  Like we'll still eat, have something good for dinner. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2372.7799999999997s)]
*  But right now I'm dealing with this little back injury [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2374.98s)]
*  and I'm like, I know if I eat, [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2377.58s)]
*  the worse I eat, the longer it's gonna take to heal. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2378.7799999999997s)]
*  So I've been trying to, like this last week, [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2381.06s)]
*  I did like a 24 hour fast. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2383.62s)]
*  I'm like, I don't need to eat. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2384.94s)]
*  I'm not really working out. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2385.7799999999997s)]
*  And then if I did eat, we were eating really clean. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2387.94s)]
*  But after a fight, a couple of weeks, [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2390.34s)]
*  I just don't give a fuck. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2391.7000000000003s)]
*  But it's still not like Snickers [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2392.82s)]
*  and fucking Skittles and shit like that. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2394.54s)]
*  You see guys like Patty, who, you know, [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2397.98s)]
*  saying that like he's kind of really developed [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2400.82s)]
*  an eating disorder because it's like the cut is so hard [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2403.02s)]
*  that after it's all off, all he wants to do is eat [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2406.78s)]
*  whatever the fuck he wants and drink. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2409.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, even when you're full, it's like, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2411.3s)]
*  but I don't have to make weight. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2413.3s)]
*  So you mentally trick yourself [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2414.38s)]
*  and there's definitely something there. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2416.26s)]
*  Like you definitely. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2418.7400000000002s)]
*  You got to crash diet 30 pounds in eight weeks. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2419.6600000000003s)]
*  You got to be so strict and you got to train twice a day. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2422.98s)]
*  So you're starving going to these sessions. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2426.34s)]
*  So you for sure cause an eating disorder. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2428.5800000000004s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2430.6200000000003s)]
*  It only makes sense. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2432.42s)]
*  It only makes sense. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2434.1000000000004s)]
*  I mean, cause it's like how much, [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2434.94s)]
*  like wrestlers too, especially, [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2436.2200000000003s)]
*  like how much of your time is fixated on losing weight. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2437.5800000000004s)]
*  It's like a big part. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2440.38s)]
*  We had Kurt Angle on, which was an amazing podcast. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2441.3s)]
*  Cause did you listen to it? [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2443.7000000000003s)]
*  When he was talking about how he weighed 199 pounds [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2445.3s)]
*  and he didn't want to cut weight to make 198. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2448.2200000000003s)]
*  So he just wrestled heavyweight. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2450.2200000000003s)]
*  He's like, I think I can beat him anyway. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2451.86s)]
*  I was like, what an animal. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2453.54s)]
*  So he's like, but plus I ate whatever I wanted. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2454.9s)]
*  I trained however I wanted. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2457.34s)]
*  I was always recovering. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2458.98s)]
*  There's something to that. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2460.2200000000003s)]
*  Cause like there was a video of him beating this dude [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2461.54s)]
*  who was 270 pounds in a wrestling match. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2463.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2466.7000000000003s)]
*  What a stud. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2467.54s)]
*  Yeah. Fuck yeah. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2468.38s)]
*  What a stud. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2469.2200000000003s)]
*  I don't need to lose a pound. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2470.0600000000004s)]
*  Not even a pound. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2470.9s)]
*  Most people are like, I can lose a pound. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2472.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2474.26s)]
*  How hard is it to lose a pound? [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2475.1000000000004s)]
*  That last camp about two and a half, [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2476.1000000000004s)]
*  no probably three weeks out, [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2478.5400000000004s)]
*  I had this some meat that did not sit well with my stomach. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2479.5800000000004s)]
*  I had diarrhea bad for like 10 days [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2482.86s)]
*  to the point where I was getting a little worried. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2485.94s)]
*  I'm like, okay. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2487.6600000000003s)]
*  Cause I was looking to step up and it's like, [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2488.5s)]
*  if you have diarrhea for like more than two, [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2490.1000000000004s)]
*  three days or whatever, it's like, [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2491.5400000000004s)]
*  probably got a parasite or some shit. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2493.38s)]
*  For 10 days, every single night, [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2494.9s)]
*  I would wake up two to three times. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2497.26s)]
*  Right when I woke up in the morning, [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2498.5400000000004s)]
*  I had to fucking shit my brains out. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2499.5800000000004s)]
*  But my weight came down real fast. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2502.8199999999997s)]
*  So I was like, well, I guess that's a benefit. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2504.66s)]
*  Cause I was like 155, 156. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2506.58s)]
*  And then by the end of those 10 days, [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2509.22s)]
*  I was walking around like 152. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2510.42s)]
*  I was like, well, that worked out, but that sucked. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2511.9s)]
*  Remember that? Fuck. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2514.7s)]
*  It's crazy for that camp too, [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2515.8599999999997s)]
*  because usually we'd be working a lot on the wall, [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2517.5s)]
*  a lot of different standups, a lot on our guard, [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2519.7799999999997s)]
*  developing the guard and the one more platters and stuff [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2521.94s)]
*  instead of giving up your back. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2524.02s)]
*  But we literally didn't get to grapple zero. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2525.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2528.62s)]
*  Five weeks out. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2529.46s)]
*  I mean, that's the first of the day from the fight. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2530.34s)]
*  But yeah, it could have been beneficial [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2532.2200000000003s)]
*  cause we were doing a lot of mitts. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2533.86s)]
*  I was just hitting mitts, hitting mitts, [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2535.38s)]
*  shadow boxing, boxing. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2536.78s)]
*  Focusing on not getting grabbed. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2538.3s)]
*  And what did you have it in your head saying? [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2540.1800000000003s)]
*  If I get grabbed, I'm dead. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2542.0600000000004s)]
*  It's life. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2543.2200000000003s)]
*  Well, I was going into that fight [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2544.04s)]
*  when I was a hundred percent healthy six weeks [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2544.88s)]
*  before the fight got announced. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2546.46s)]
*  I'm like, it's life or death if he grabs me. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2547.3s)]
*  Not because I don't think I can grapple, [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2548.78s)]
*  but that's the mindset I want. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2549.98s)]
*  Because that's really gonna make it [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2551.1000000000004s)]
*  to where I'm not gonna let, [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2552.5800000000004s)]
*  and if he does grab me, I'm gonna do everything [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2554.1000000000004s)]
*  I'm fucking capable of. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2555.6600000000003s)]
*  That's why I try to, I mean, [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2556.7000000000003s)]
*  I feel like I got out of that so fast. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2557.7799999999997s)]
*  Like the longer we're here, the better it is for him. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2559.38s)]
*  But yeah, so we went into that fight, [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2561.56s)]
*  life or death if he grabs me. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2563.12s)]
*  And then when I got that injury, I was like, [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2564.42s)]
*  it's just that times fucking 10. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2566.2599999999998s)]
*  I cannot let this motherfucker touch me. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2568.14s)]
*  So what was the extent of the- [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2569.9s)]
*  I had a muscle strain in between my ribs [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2570.98s)]
*  and I couldn't even get into like a light clinch. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2573.22s)]
*  I don't know, it fucking just, yeah, it hurts so bad. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2577.2599999999998s)]
*  I haven't even tried to grapple since the fight yet too, [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2580.22s)]
*  cause I'm dealing with this little back injury right now. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2582.2999999999997s)]
*  So, but I'm hoping by now it should be good. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2584.22s)]
*  The muscle strains are fucked. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2586.7s)]
*  The ones in between the ribs are so hard. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2588.8199999999997s)]
*  Sometimes people tear the cartilage as well. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2591.02s)]
*  Did you get an MRI? [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2593.02s)]
*  I did get an MRI. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2593.8599999999997s)]
*  I didn't tear anything that I remember. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2594.8199999999997s)]
*  I think it was just a muscle strain, [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2597.1s)]
*  but like we gave it a couple of weeks to say, [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2598.46s)]
*  all right, let's just see if it'll heal in a couple of weeks [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2601.18s)]
*  and then try to grapple again. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2602.8199999999997s)]
*  Tried to grapple in just the littlest [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2603.7s)]
*  kind of together movement. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2605.8999999999996s)]
*  Couldn't do it, which sucked. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2607.9399999999996s)]
*  Cause that was the fight I had the most mental demons [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2610.22s)]
*  going in cause I was like, I'd like to be able to grapple. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2611.98s)]
*  You know, I'd like to be able to fucking grapple. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2615.58s)]
*  Cause even for all fight week, I told the whole team, [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2618.1s)]
*  like I don't want to do anything to where I feel this. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2620.46s)]
*  Cause I'm in my mind, it's fixed. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2622.98s)]
*  I'm good. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2625.1s)]
*  I haven't heard it in a couple of weeks. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2625.94s)]
*  I convinced myself that it was a hundred percent fine. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2627.42s)]
*  And so all fight week, we didn't even clinch once. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2630.42s)]
*  No grapple, no zero exchanges. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2632.7799999999997s)]
*  I take a Michael Jordan type athlete though, [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2636.98s)]
*  just to have that kind of pressure going against this guy [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2639.22s)]
*  who's the best on the fucking planet [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2641.9s)]
*  and just being in the moment and not worrying about that. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2643.5s)]
*  I mean, fucking impressive. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2645.62s)]
*  Yeah. Well, the result was amazing. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2648.14s)]
*  That was probably one of the prettiest right hands [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2650.78s)]
*  I've ever seen in my life. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2652.34s)]
*  Floating back too. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2653.18s)]
*  I mean, it's literally like Muhammad Ali, Sonny Liston. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2654.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2659.34s)]
*  Steps back away. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2660.18s)]
*  Bam. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2661.02s)]
*  That was crazy. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2662.18s)]
*  Yeah. And the TD garden too. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2663.0s)]
*  That was cool. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2663.86s)]
*  Boston. That was wild. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2664.7s)]
*  Cause that was my first main event. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2666.78s)]
*  And every time I fought, I always felt like it was a big deal [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2668.14s)]
*  on the card. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2671.14s)]
*  Like the sugar show was there. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2671.98s)]
*  But when we were in Boston, that arena was 99% sugar, [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2673.54s)]
*  1% Aljo, if that. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2677.94s)]
*  Like the fuck you Aljo chants were louder [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2680.42s)]
*  than like them cheering me on. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2682.9s)]
*  It wasn't, I felt bad at some point. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2684.82s)]
*  I was like, Oh God. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2687.66s)]
*  Isn't it crazy that it's all because of the way he won [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2688.7s)]
*  the title by disqualification, which is not his fault at all. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2690.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2693.94s)]
*  Not his fault at all. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2694.86s)]
*  Other than that, everybody liked him. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2695.86s)]
*  It's crazy that no one had any problem with him [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2697.5s)]
*  up until that fight. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2699.7s)]
*  Like everybody loved Aljo. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2700.62s)]
*  When he choked out Sandhagen, everybody loved Aljo. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2702.34s)]
*  Like Aljo was the fucking man. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2705.42s)]
*  And then he gets fouled and like legitimately got fouled. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2707.1000000000004s)]
*  And his neck was fucked up before he went into that fight. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2710.94s)]
*  He's had a fucked up neck. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2714.98s)]
*  He has dis replacement in his neck. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2715.9s)]
*  So he's got an artificial disc in his neck [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2717.38s)]
*  because of an injury that he had. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2719.02s)]
*  And then Piotr Jan hits him with that fucking knee [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2721.38s)]
*  to the head on the ground. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2723.26s)]
*  It's crazy how that knee changed so many people. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2724.54s)]
*  Like my career, I ended up fighting Peter [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2726.6600000000003s)]
*  instead of Peter being champ. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2728.9s)]
*  And just like, it's crazy how that one mistake [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2729.94s)]
*  Peter made and now he's on a fucking three fight. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2733.02s)]
*  Losing streak. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2733.98s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2734.8199999999997s)]
*  Or four maybe. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2735.66s)]

*  Yeah, he got robbed recently in California. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2747.8599999999997s)]
*  Oh yeah I saw that. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2749.8199999999997s)]
*  I saw him talking about it. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2750.66s)]
*  Scary shit dude, at a gas station. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2752.54s)]

*  If only those guys knew. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2756.94s)]
*  I mean I guess if you got a gun, [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2758.22s)]
*  like no, it doesn't, much you can do but. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2759.2999999999997s)]
*  Not much you can do. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2761.58s)]
*  We saw this weekend that one comedian died. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2762.9s)]
*  I didn't see that. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2767.22s)]
*  Is comedians in depression, is that a pretty common thing? [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2768.06s)]
*  Oh yeah for sure. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2771.42s)]
*  I didn't know this guy but everybody at the club last night [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2773.02s)]
*  was so sad. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2776.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2777.9s)]
*  A lot of, he was, my friend David Lucas' opening act. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2778.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2782.02s)]
*  A lot of people knew him, it was a bummer. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2782.86s)]
*  I did not know him but he took his own life apparently. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2784.62s)]
*  Yeah, that's crazy. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2788.14s)]
*  Yeah it's like, there's a lot of the reasons [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2789.86s)]
*  why people wanna do comedy is because they want, [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2791.98s)]
*  they want a moment in their life where it's fun. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2796.02s)]
*  And if they can make other people laugh, [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2800.26s)]
*  so at least for that moment, it would be fun. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2801.7400000000002s)]
*  Like this guy was one of the greatest of all time, [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2804.58s)]
*  Richard Jenney, he took his own life. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2806.34s)]
*  Shot himself in the bathtub. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2808.7000000000003s)]
*  And then he didn't die and they had to take him [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2811.1400000000003s)]
*  to the hospital. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2812.98s)]
*  No. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2813.82s)]
*  He died at the hospital yeah. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2814.6400000000003s)]
*  But he was one of the best comedians ever [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2816.22s)]
*  and one just hated life, he was so depressed. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2820.3799999999997s)]
*  Just the fact that everybody, all the comics worshiped him. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2824.18s)]
*  Like when he was in the room, [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2828.58s)]
*  everybody would come in and watch Jenney. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2829.58s)]
*  Like oh my God Jenney's on stage, let's go watch Jenney. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2830.98s)]
*  He was so good. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2833.3799999999997s)]
*  He did this one club in Long Island [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2834.66s)]
*  called East Side Comedy Club. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2838.06s)]
*  And this guy Peter who was the host, [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2840.2999999999997s)]
*  we were all sitting around after the show [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2842.58s)]
*  and Peter was depressed. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2844.5s)]
*  I said why are you depressed? [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2846.74s)]
*  He goes, he did four different hours. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2847.74s)]
*  He goes he did two different hours on Friday [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2850.82s)]
*  and two different hours on Saturday and just destroyed. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2853.22s)]
*  And you would think a guy who's that good [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2856.4s)]
*  at the top of his game, just killing it. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2858.46s)]
*  Like the guy's on the top of the world. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2861.06s)]
*  He's probably so happy, everybody loves him. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2862.58s)]
*  Meanwhile, God kills himself. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2864.86s)]
*  I was watching this Dion Sanders little documentary [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2868.1s)]
*  on YouTube and he tried to kill himself [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2870.7s)]
*  after winning the Super Bowl. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2872.7s)]
*  Tried to drive his car off a cliff. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2875.7799999999997s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2877.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, that was great. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2878.46s)]
*  I didn't really know much about Dion Sanders' prime time [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2879.4199999999996s)]
*  but that dude fucking played in the MLB and NFL [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2881.66s)]
*  at the same time in the same seasons. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2884.8599999999997s)]
*  He was signing one off contracts [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2886.7s)]
*  to go play with the fucking teams. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2888.48s)]
*  Then he would fly in a helicopter to the football game. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2890.58s)]
*  That was a fucking, I didn't realize [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2893.74s)]
*  how good of an athlete he was. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2895.52s)]
*  Imagine a guy like that taking up MMA. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2897.4199999999996s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2899.58s)]
*  Because there's like calibers of athletes [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2901.14s)]
*  that I think just automatically go into the NFL [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2903.02s)]
*  or the NBA or the, they go where the real money is. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2905.58s)]
*  They don't have that desire to fight. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2909.7000000000003s)]
*  Some people just have this desire to fight. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2911.2200000000003s)]
*  And some guys are just, they're just competitors. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2913.7400000000002s)]
*  But if you can get one of those like super elite NFL [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2916.46s)]
*  running back guys, there's guys out there that are freaks. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2919.46s)]
*  Yeah, I wonder what Dion Wade, he probably wasn't like, [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2923.7200000000003s)]
*  he doesn't look huge. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2927.02s)]
*  He was 170 or something. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2928.86s)]
*  Yeah, he would have been a, [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2929.7000000000003s)]
*  there's something just different than competing in NFL. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2931.42s)]
*  I mean, I don't know, there's some crazy motherfuckers [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2934.22s)]
*  that compete in the NFL. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2935.86s)]

*  that get those high highs, [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2958.94s)]
*  like not many people experience the depression [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2960.9s)]
*  that comes after it. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2963.26s)]
*  I think what goes up comes down. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2964.1s)]
*  So even after the fights, try not to like fucking, [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2966.66s)]
*  don't get too excited. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2969.18s)]
*  Cause I know it's like, just try to kind of [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2970.46s)]
*  live that around that zero, like right around [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2972.5s)]
*  or just balance. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2976.1s)]
*  Yeah, just stay calm. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2976.94s)]
*  Just kind of stay there. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2978.1s)]
*  But I mean, yeah, no, it is hard. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2978.92s)]
*  Cause those highs all fight week, [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2980.86s)]
*  everyone wants to fucking talk to you. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2982.06s)]
*  You're the fucking man. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2983.26s)]
*  Then you win. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2984.14s)]
*  And then it's like the next week, you're just kind of at home [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2985.34s)]
*  and just like sitting around and it's like, whoa. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2987.3s)]
*  It is weird. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2989.86s)]
*  But then the plunges and stuff help you. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2990.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, having to fucking, learning how to deal [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2992.1800000000003s)]
*  with that stuff and still working out. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2993.9s)]
*  Having to work out. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2995.98s)]
*  It's crazy cause I haven't worked out really much [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2996.86s)]
*  since the last fight. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=2999.1400000000003s)]
*  Just trying to heal everything up, [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3000.0600000000004s)]
*  prepare for kill next year. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3001.42s)]
*  You saying the plunges mentally, [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3004.5400000000004s)]
*  the plunges help you mentally? [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3005.98s)]
*  I think so. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3006.98s)]
*  For sure. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3007.82s)]
*  Cold plunge? [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3008.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I think mentally, I don't know what it is about it, [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3009.48s)]
*  but I think what it is just not wanting to do it [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3011.3s)]
*  and then fucking doing it and getting out. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3013.78s)]
*  There's something about that. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3015.9s)]
*  The physical benefits and all that shit. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3017.98s)]
*  But the plunges definitely fucking help me mentally, [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3019.82s)]
*  just stay fucking kind of grounded. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3023.66s)]
*  Yeah, I mean the happiness you get from training fucking [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3025.7400000000002s)]
*  hard and then doing the plunge, [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3028.66s)]
*  knowing it's good for you and how good it makes you feel, [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3030.38s)]
*  it's like, there's just something about it, dude. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3032.5s)]
*  Yeah, and it just rings all the bullshit out of your brain. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3035.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3040.46s)]
*  Just all the dumb shit that's in there [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3041.3s)]
*  that you would just let bounce around [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3043.98s)]
*  if you didn't work out or if you didn't cold plunge [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3046.14s)]
*  or something like that. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3048.66s)]
*  I feel like the morning routines too, [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3049.5s)]
*  like I notice, right after the fights, [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3051.2999999999997s)]
*  I'm my discipline of, [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3053.42s)]
*  cause I'm just like all out, 100% discipline, [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3054.94s)]
*  I'm gonna do what I need to do to perform that night. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3056.74s)]
*  But right after the fight, the next week or two, [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3059.54s)]
*  I'm like, hey, I'm gonna just fucking kind of just [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3061.14s)]
*  maybe lay in bed a little bit longer, do that. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3062.8199999999997s)]
*  But once you get back to my morning routine [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3065.06s)]
*  where I got my red light, my PMF machine, my cold plunge, [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3066.66s)]
*  all that stuff and I just do that, [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3071.38s)]
*  I go in there for like 30 minutes in the morning, [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3072.7s)]
*  just fucking prepare for the day. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3074.66s)]
*  You ever use those PMF machines? [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3076.1s)]
*  No, what is it? [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3078.14s)]
*  Fucking pulse electric magnetic field, [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3078.98s)]
*  is that what it's called? [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3081.46s)]
*  Yeah, it's like two mats. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3082.2999999999997s)]
*  I mean, I saw it on Tony Robbins. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3083.3399999999997s)]
*  He was waking it up one day, did a mat and it covers [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3085.1s)]
*  and it pulses all these like electrical through you, [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3088.3399999999997s)]
*  boom, boom, boom, gets the cells moving and stuff. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3091.14s)]
*  Good for inflammation in the body. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3093.2599999999998s)]
*  I fucking love it. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3095.14s)]
*  You feel the difference? [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3095.98s)]
*  I fucking love it, I really do. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3096.8199999999997s)]
*  I like it. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3098.46s)]
*  Do you like the experience of just doing it [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3099.5s)]
*  or do you like the benefits? [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3101.2999999999997s)]
*  I like the way it feels too. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3102.3s)]
*  And I do feel it does feel kind of cool, [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3105.2200000000003s)]
*  but I feel like there's benefits. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3107.2200000000003s)]
*  I feel like the cells, especially if you read the benefits [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3109.2200000000003s)]
*  and then you really kind of just tell yourself like, [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3112.34s)]
*  okay, this is what's happening. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3114.7000000000003s)]
*  Scotty from Mexico told us about it [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3116.46s)]
*  and told us how good it was. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3118.9s)]
*  Scotty Nelson? [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3119.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, with inflammation and stuff. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3120.5800000000004s)]
*  So we looked into it, [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3122.34s)]
*  we got some pretty high powered machines, [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3123.1800000000003s)]
*  but we were hanging out with Dana a couple of weeks ago [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3124.5800000000004s)]
*  and just both you guys just have such like [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3127.1400000000003s)]
*  this good high energy. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3129.26s)]
*  It's like motivating to be around. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3130.62s)]
*  For sure. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3132.3399999999997s)]
*  Fucking pretty badass. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3133.18s)]
*  Especially seeing you kill on stage [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3134.18s)]
*  and then even before like having that good energy [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3135.7s)]
*  and you already did a show [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3137.62s)]
*  then you're in the green room fucking just, [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3138.98s)]
*  like you don't see many guys even younger than you [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3141.2599999999998s)]
*  or our age that have that energy. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3145.22s)]
*  It's powerful to be around like being around Dana too. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3147.62s)]
*  Just fucking fires you up. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3150.9s)]
*  Yeah, he's healthy. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3153.22s)]
*  One of the things I always tell comics is, [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3154.06s)]
*  because a lot of comics they eat poorly, [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3155.62s)]
*  they don't exercise, they're lazy. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3157.94s)]
*  I always tell them like you have more energy. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3159.82s)]
*  Like your body is your vehicle for carrying you through life. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3163.02s)]
*  It's not a vanity thing. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3165.86s)]
*  Like it could be a vanity thing, [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3167.34s)]
*  but don't think about it that way. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3168.42s)]
*  Think about it like you can actually soup up your race car. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3169.82s)]
*  You want something that can do things [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3174.1800000000003s)]
*  that other ones can't. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3176.02s)]
*  Like have the energy to do two shows easy. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3177.1000000000004s)]
*  It's no problem. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3179.9s)]
*  I did four shows last night. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3180.7400000000002s)]
*  Jeez. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3181.5800000000004s)]
*  Two shows in the little room. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3182.78s)]
*  So I did two of those improvised shows, [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3184.1400000000003s)]
*  the bottom of the barrel shows [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3186.1400000000003s)]
*  and then I did two hours in the big room. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3187.26s)]
*  That's fucking sweet. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3190.46s)]
*  I can see how just being in that green room, [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3191.2999999999997s)]
*  like crave that every night. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3194.22s)]
*  Just or every, at least a couple of times a week, [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3195.8599999999997s)]
*  just going in there, [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3197.58s)]
*  bullshit with the guys, watching some comedy. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3198.58s)]
*  I was so fun to be around. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3201.06s)]
*  Well, I was telling Sugar, I'm like, [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3202.7799999999997s)]
*  cause how old are you now? [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3204.06s)]
*  56. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3205.1s)]
*  56, like bro, that's going to be us when we're 56. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3205.94s)]
*  Healthy, reving up, ready to fucking go. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3208.5s)]
*  You can air in the coal mine, kids. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3211.02s)]
*  I'm hoping, I'm hoping when I'm 56, [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3213.22s)]
*  I'm fucking revving up like that. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3215.42s)]
*  Well, when you're 56, you won't be fighting. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3217.54s)]
*  So when you're 56, you can take testosterone [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3220.54s)]
*  and peptides and that's the big thing. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3222.34s)]
*  The big thing is that people don't want to do that [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3224.86s)]
*  cause they think it's cheating. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3226.7799999999997s)]
*  Like, listen, you don't have much time. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3228.58s)]
*  This life goes by really quick. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3231.02s)]
*  I was your age when I came to Hollywood [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3232.98s)]
*  and it just, it seemed like almost like yesterday. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3237.2999999999997s)]
*  Just fucking goes by. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3240.42s)]
*  All of a sudden you're, you mean, obviously doesn't [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3241.2599999999998s)]
*  cause when you look back at those memories [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3244.38s)]
*  and who you used to be, it's interesting to compare yourself [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3245.74s)]
*  but at the end of the day, it doesn't stop. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3248.54s)]
*  Every day comes whether you want it to or not. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3251.9s)]
*  You can't hit pause. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3254.14s)]
*  It doesn't exist. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3255.3s)]
*  So it just goes and goes and goes and if you fucking slip [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3256.86s)]
*  and if you let it go, if you don't do what you should do, [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3259.7s)]
*  you'll have a life of regret. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3263.86s)]
*  That's what I'm trying to remind myself too. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3265.3s)]
*  I'm like, I'm 28 right now. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3266.7s)]
*  I got in the UFC when I was 22. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3268.22s)]
*  So it's like, it's already been that long. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3270.5s)]
*  I basically have that time again [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3272.42s)]
*  until I'm probably going to retire and be done. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3275.38s)]
*  I'm like, and it went by so fast. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3277.02s)]
*  And I need to make sure too right now, especially [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3278.9s)]
*  cause you get so many opportunities to go do things [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3280.66s)]
*  but like to just keep reminding myself, what's the goal? [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3282.78s)]
*  What's the goal? [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3285.42s)]
*  What's the goal? [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3286.2599999999998s)]
*  Just to fucking keep training. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3287.08s)]
*  And for the next six, seven years, [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3287.92s)]
*  just be as fucking good as I can be [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3289.58s)]
*  because I'm going to be fucking 40 and going, God damn it. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3291.42s)]
*  Do you think you'll know when to stop? [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3295.58s)]
*  Do you think, do you have like an idea in your head? [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3298.38s)]
*  Like, is it a number or is it when your body [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3301.78s)]
*  just doesn't feel it anymore? [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3304.5s)]
*  I would like to, yeah. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3306.86s)]
*  I mean, if all goes well, I think if I'm healthy [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3309.26s)]
*  it's going to be hard. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3313.82s)]
*  If I'm healthy, it will be hard to stop fighting. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3315.18s)]
*  But. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3318.7s)]
*  But why would you stop if you're healthy? [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3320.2200000000003s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3321.82s)]
*  I mean. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3322.66s)]
*  I mean, I would want you to stop [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3323.5s)]
*  if I see performance slipping. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3324.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3326.58s)]
*  There's something about, you know, when you watch fights [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3327.42s)]
*  as much as I watch fights and you've seen certain guys [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3330.86s)]
*  for as long as I see, I kind of have like, [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3334.14s)]
*  it's almost like there's, I know what they do. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3339.7s)]
*  So I see them and I have like a mold [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3344.2999999999997s)]
*  that I can put them in. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3348.02s)]
*  So like when I see guys moving different [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3349.42s)]
*  and I see guys slowing down and I see guys throwing one, two [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3352.7s)]
*  and then not reacting on the counter shot [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3357.54s)]
*  and not throwing the counter kicks, is his legs gone? [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3359.94s)]
*  Is his knees fucked? [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3362.3399999999997s)]
*  Why is he moving? [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3364.42s)]
*  I start to see it. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3365.26s)]
*  And you just, they look kind of the same, like the same guy [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3366.26s)]
*  but in my mind, in the mold, these things don't, [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3369.38s)]
*  they don't fit anymore. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3372.02s)]
*  So I go, okay, there's been a change. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3373.38s)]
*  What about Izzy's last fight? [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3375.1000000000004s)]
*  Because I don't think he's necessarily, [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3376.5400000000004s)]
*  he looked like that last fight. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3378.94s)]
*  He looked like he was stuck in the mud. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3380.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3382.6600000000003s)]
*  But I don't know if he's necessarily on the hill. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3383.5s)]
*  We talked about that last night. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3385.34s)]
*  That might've been an issue. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3386.86s)]
*  There could be multiple issues. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3389.1000000000004s)]
*  It could be just a weird physical thing. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3390.6200000000003s)]
*  Maybe he just woke up and he just didn't feel good [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3392.82s)]
*  which does happen. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3395.3s)]
*  It would suck a fat dick if that happened [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3396.9s)]
*  on a world title fight against a guy [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3398.86s)]
*  who's been talking mad shit about you, [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3400.34s)]
*  calling you a slut for China. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3402.1400000000003s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3403.94s)]
*  But it can happen to people where you're just flat. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3405.3s)]
*  I'd be curious to see him come back. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3408.42s)]
*  Also, before we say any of that, [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3410.42s)]
*  Sean Strickland looks so fucking good. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3413.5s)]
*  I don't know if that was Izzy being flat. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3415.82s)]
*  It might be that he underestimated him. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3419.3s)]
*  Chris Curtis says all the time people come in, [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3422.22s)]
*  good ass kickboxers come in [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3424.58s)]
*  and Sean Strickland just frustrates them, [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3426.02s)]
*  pressures them so much, doesn't let off the gas pedal, [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3427.7799999999997s)]
*  defends all their hard shots and keeps pressure. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3430.22s)]
*  He says he makes a lot of guys look bad like that. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3432.3399999999997s)]
*  Dude, I think he's also got that front kick to the body [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3434.98s)]
*  off the left leg that people aren't talking about. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3438.14s)]
*  That was so important. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3440.22s)]
*  It was so important because he's standing like this [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3442.02s)]
*  straight up and you don't know when it's coming [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3444.3399999999997s)]
*  and every now and then he's stabbing you in the gut. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3446.66s)]
*  And he doesn't throw a lot of kicks [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3449.2999999999997s)]
*  but he throws a very effective left front kick [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3451.18s)]
*  and his fucking checks are on the money. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3453.58s)]
*  Yeah, you could tell Izzy, like you could almost hear it [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3455.8199999999997s)]
*  even on the TV, like he would land those stabbing kicks. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3459.14s)]
*  And that motherfucker spars like that so often [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3462.18s)]
*  that he's composed. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3465.1s)]
*  It's just another day. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3466.2599999999998s)]
*  It's another day. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3467.1s)]
*  He doesn't get tired. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3467.9199999999996s)]
*  In the fifth fucking round, [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3468.7599999999998s)]
*  I was watching his stomach in between rounds, flat. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3470.18s)]
*  Just standing there, drinking water, flat. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3474.1s)]
*  Like 50, 60 beats a minute. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3476.3799999999997s)]
*  I'm like, this is crazy. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3479.22s)]
*  This guy's calm and relaxed in the fifth fucking round [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3480.7400000000002s)]
*  of his first world title fight [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3483.1800000000003s)]
*  against one of the greatest of all time. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3484.6200000000003s)]
*  A guy who just dominated and had that incredible speech. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3487.34s)]
*  One time. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3492.1800000000003s)]
*  I want you to feel this one time in your life. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3493.5600000000004s)]
*  That was probably the coolest moment for me ever [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3496.0600000000004s)]
*  when he knocked down Para. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3498.46s)]
*  Yeah, fucking. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3499.7000000000003s)]
*  The arrows, come on. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3501.42s)]
*  Greatest celebration. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3503.0600000000004s)]
*  Fired up. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3504.3s)]
*  Greatest celebration of all time. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3505.1400000000003s)]
*  That was good. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3506.26s)]
*  That was fucking good. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3507.1000000000004s)]
*  Made me wanna cry for him. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3507.94s)]
*  DC posted how many UFCs he had lined [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3510.1s)]
*  and it was fucking insane within like five, six years. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3513.2200000000003s)]
*  Maybe that had a factor too. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3516.86s)]
*  Maybe it's just an overload factor. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3518.54s)]
*  Maybe he takes six months off, gets recharged. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3520.2200000000003s)]
*  Well, I was talking to UFC recently [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3523.14s)]
*  and we just bullshitting there like, [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3525.34s)]
*  is he's constantly, same with Volkonovsky asking, [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3527.58s)]
*  let me fight, let me fight, let me fight, let me fight. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3531.54s)]
*  I asked him, I said, do you think he's gonna wanna chill [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3533.32s)]
*  for a little bit? [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3535.34s)]
*  And they're like, fuck no. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3536.18s)]
*  Fuck no. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3537.14s)]
*  I could call him tomorrow and say, [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3537.98s)]
*  hey, you wanna fight on MSG? [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3538.86s)]
*  And he'd say, yes, please. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3539.7000000000003s)]
*  Like how much is his five round training camps changing [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3540.94s)]
*  after the eighth one? [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3543.86s)]
*  Yeah, do you still fucking do what you did in the first one? [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3545.86s)]
*  They go hard over there at City Kickboxing. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3548.6200000000003s)]
*  Fuck. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3550.6200000000003s)]
*  That is an amazing gym. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3551.46s)]
*  Yeah, Eugene seems like a cool motherfucker. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3552.28s)]
*  Eugene Barrowman is the fucking man. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3554.1400000000003s)]
*  He's gotta be up there with the greatest. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3554.98s)]
*  He's the fucking man. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3555.82s)]
*  And he's so calm and composed and rational. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3557.1000000000004s)]
*  The way he gives corner advice, [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3560.34s)]
*  the way he talks, even in the post-fight press conference [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3562.06s)]
*  when he talked about it, you know, [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3564.2200000000003s)]
*  it's like he's so composed, he's so good. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3566.2200000000003s)]
*  There's a cool video when I fought Peter [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3569.58s)]
*  going into the, from the first round, [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3570.9399999999996s)]
*  going into the second round for Tim saying, [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3572.8599999999997s)]
*  hey, when you're Southpaw, faint low, [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3574.5s)]
*  throw that left hand over the top [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3576.4199999999996s)]
*  in the first minute into that, [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3577.7799999999997s)]
*  you literally see it play by play [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3579.22s)]
*  of what I did to crack Peter, boom. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3581.4199999999996s)]
*  And then the second round going into the third round, [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3583.7799999999997s)]
*  Tim was like, trust that knee up the middle, it's there. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3585.22s)]
*  And that's what fucking cut Peter. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3587.14s)]
*  So corner advice is fucking huge. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3589.18s)]
*  And a lot of the times you watch fights [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3591.46s)]
*  and you hear corners like, just talking to talk [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3593.2999999999997s)]
*  because I feel like they have to say something. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3596.8199999999997s)]
*  So they're just kind of just making shit up [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3599.52s)]
*  instead of like saying something [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3601.64s)]
*  that's fucking truly gonna be important, [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3604.0s)]
*  not over talking, saying what you need to fucking say [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3605.8399999999997s)]
*  and then let the corner breathe. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3608.3199999999997s)]
*  I don't, I'm not trying to listen to a fucking, [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3609.72s)]
*  you know, a bunch of shit. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3611.7999999999997s)]
*  Tell me a couple of things that I need to know [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3612.88s)]
*  and then let me get my fucking heart rate down. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3614.16s)]
*  That's what Tim does a really good job of. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3615.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, you guys have such an amazing relationship [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3617.64s)]
*  because you were both there at the very beginning. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3619.7999999999997s)]
*  Like when the, when the two of you came in five years ago, [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3622.36s)]
*  I'm like, what a cool thing you guys have going on. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3624.88s)]
*  Because Tim is so knowledgeable and so focused [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3627.84s)]
*  and also a great martial artist himself. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3630.52s)]
*  So he's watching all these aspects of your training [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3632.7200000000003s)]
*  with another mind, like an objective mind [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3636.8s)]
*  that's not experiencing it outside of it, [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3640.6000000000004s)]
*  looking at all the aspects of what you need to do. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3642.84s)]
*  And because you guys sync together so well, [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3645.52s)]
*  it's such a massive advantage, man. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3648.2000000000003s)]
*  I feel like it truly is. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3650.8s)]
*  Yeah, when I see other coaches out there and fighters, [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3652.88s)]
*  I just feel like even if they're got a good relationship, [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3654.76s)]
*  we hang out every single fucking day. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3657.2799999999997s)]
*  We podcast together, we do everything together. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3659.52s)]
*  We'll go grab lunch, hang out with our girls together, [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3661.52s)]
*  travel, I do everything together, train together. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3663.4s)]
*  And it's just, I feel like there's a chemistry there [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3666.96s)]
*  that a lot of fighter coaches don't have. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3669.56s)]
*  Because we're like best friends too, it's not like coach. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3671.44s)]
*  But yeah, in the training room when we're hitting minutes, [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3674.2s)]
*  sparring days, it's like, we turn that on and it's good. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3675.92s)]
*  It must be awesome for you, Tim, [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3679.6s)]
*  because you took a giant risk in your life doing this, [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3680.8399999999997s)]
*  dedicating yourself to one athlete, [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3683.92s)]
*  and other athletes too. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3686.36s)]
*  But I mean, it's like a big thing, man, you did. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3687.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I think I've just loved the sport [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3690.6800000000003s)]
*  and loved martial arts and all the different arts so much. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3693.48s)]
*  And then getting to live with Robert Fallis [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3696.2000000000003s)]
*  and seeing another guy who's so passionate about it. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3698.28s)]
*  I miss that dude. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3700.84s)]
*  Get to live with him and saw it, [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3701.76s)]
*  looked up to him so much. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3703.2400000000002s)]
*  I feel like I'm literally living my dream job. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3704.48s)]
*  So I feel lucky. That's so awesome. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3708.88s)]
*  Yeah, you naturally were always, [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3710.92s)]
*  because when you were still fighting, [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3712.1600000000003s)]
*  you were still trying to get into UFC, [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3715.0s)]
*  you were in Bellator, you went on Ultimate Fighter. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3716.44s)]
*  But every time I had a fight coming up [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3718.28s)]
*  for a couple weeks, you'd switch into coach mode. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3719.56s)]
*  Without us, it just naturally happened. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3722.28s)]
*  It wasn't really planned. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3724.7200000000003s)]
*  It was like, all right, now you're in the corner. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3726.28s)]
*  Now you're the coach. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3728.7200000000003s)]
*  Such a cool situation. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3729.56s)]
*  It just happened. It just literally fucking happened. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3730.4s)]
*  And he would hold mitts for me, [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3732.2000000000003s)]
*  and it's fucking wild. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3734.04s)]
*  Yeah, again though, it's like, [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3736.2400000000002s)]
*  it doesn't matter how good of a coach you got. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3738.04s)]
*  The athletes that can go in there, be in the moment, [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3741.08s)]
*  be calm and make it happen. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3743.44s)]
*  It's like, that is so fucking rare. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3744.96s)]
*  And I don't know where that came from with you, [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3747.2000000000003s)]
*  but I remember seeing you when you're 17 years old, [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3748.96s)]
*  kickboxing in the cage, [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3751.48s)]
*  and you looked comfortable in there. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3753.08s)]
*  Like you were just having fun. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3754.08s)]
*  And then I saw him when he, when I was 18, [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3755.6s)]
*  I saw him fight this wrestler still just having fun in there. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3757.7200000000003s)]
*  And that's when I invited him down. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3760.16s)]
*  Every single fight, even you said against Aljo, [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3761.88s)]
*  how were your nerves? [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3765.04s)]
*  Or Peter Yan in Abu Dhabi, who butchers people. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3766.08s)]
*  He doesn't just beat people, [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3769.76s)]
*  he fucking cuts them and beats the fuck out of them. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3770.84s)]
*  And you were just stone cold in the locker room. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3773.2799999999997s)]
*  It's crazy too, when we were coming up, [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3775.4s)]
*  it was $330 a month rent a piece. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3777.3599999999997s)]
*  We had this shitty apartment. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3780.04s)]
*  Just fucking, those memories were so crazy. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3782.12s)]
*  They're so vivid too. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3784.44s)]
*  And it was so much fun. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3785.3599999999997s)]
*  We just stayed in this shitty apartment. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3786.2s)]
*  I had never lived with anybody other than my parents. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3787.24s)]
*  So he had to like, hey dude, do your fucking dishes. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3789.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I'm like, oh yeah. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3791.6s)]
*  Yeah, he didn't know how to do laundry. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3793.44s)]
*  My mom did all that shit for me. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3795.0s)]
*  So it was like, yeah, that's crazy. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3796.4s)]
*  It's been a crazy climb. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3799.04s)]
*  Yeah, it has been. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3800.3599999999997s)]
*  It's so hard in the beginning [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3802.04s)]
*  because you're not sure if it's going to work out. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3804.2400000000002s)]
*  It's weird, I was so fucking positive. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3806.28s)]
*  Really? [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3808.72s)]
*  Even telling him when I was 18, 19 years old, [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3809.56s)]
*  when I moved down, I said, I'm going to be the big, [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3811.04s)]
*  like I'm going to be in the UFC, [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3813.12s)]
*  I'm going to be a fucking superstar. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3814.84s)]
*  And he would be like. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3816.96s)]
*  I have, I would just think this kid has no fucking idea [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3818.2s)]
*  how good people are. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3821.28s)]
*  Wait till he feels how good people are. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3822.56s)]
*  I was delusional for sure. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3824.2400000000002s)]
*  You think it's good to be delusional? [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3825.72s)]
*  I do. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3826.92s)]
*  I think a little bit of delusion is an important ingredient [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3827.76s)]
*  in the recipe of success because I was, I mean, [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3831.32s)]
*  I might've been too delusional, [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3834.92s)]
*  but I also got very humbled a lot too. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3836.2s)]
*  Like I would get humbled and I would be like, [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3838.84s)]
*  God, this is not what, [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3840.48s)]
*  but then for whatever reason I would come back to me [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3841.96s)]
*  and be like, no, I'm going to be, [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3843.76s)]
*  I'm going to be fucking world champ. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3844.6s)]
*  I'm going to be one of the biggest stars in the UFC. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3846.16s)]
*  But I remember telling him that [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3848.76s)]
*  even like when I first moved down and, but yeah. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3849.92s)]
*  Well, I remember when I first met you [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3854.12s)]
*  and we first started talking, [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3855.32s)]
*  I couldn't believe you didn't have a background [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3856.28s)]
*  in traditional martial arts. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3857.8s)]
*  Cause you throw kicks so well. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3859.52s)]
*  I was like, he looks like a karate guy. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3861.16s)]
*  That was assuming you had a, like you, [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3863.2s)]
*  maybe when you were a kid, you did karate or taekwondo. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3865.0s)]
*  Basketball, football, baseball, soccer, all every, [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3867.92s)]
*  different sport all year round for, [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3871.84s)]
*  since I was probably five, six years old, [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3873.7599999999998s)]
*  just constantly being an athlete, doing athletic stuff. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3875.48s)]
*  I feel like helped develop my, [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3879.0s)]
*  I do think too, some people just have this, [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3880.92s)]
*  this ability to fight. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3885.96s)]
*  I just understand fighting, like distance, faints, [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3887.72s)]
*  that stuff came so natural to me. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3892.16s)]
*  I could just, like when I first started fighting, [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3894.56s)]
*  I was fainting. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3896.4399999999996s)]
*  I didn't know what I was fainting. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3898.12s)]
*  I was just fighting and I was just, [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3899.56s)]
*  I just happened so fucking natural. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3901.7999999999997s)]
*  I think some people just have that, that ability. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3904.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I definitely think the background [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3907.7999999999997s)]
*  in athletic helps. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3911.2s)]
*  But it doesn't make a fighter. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3912.8799999999997s)]
*  The fighter thing is the, like some guys can do it [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3914.7999999999997s)]
*  and some guys can't do it and it's, [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3918.36s)]
*  and you can't predict it. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3919.56s)]
*  And some guys can do it up until like level eight [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3920.68s)]
*  or level nine, like the Marlin rise guys. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3923.36s)]
*  Yeah. They can get real close. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3926.16s)]
*  But for whatever reason, in those moments, [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3927.8s)]
*  those chaotic moments, they can't keep it together. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3930.92s)]
*  Fuck. Yeah. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3934.0s)]
*  I mean, I still gotta go out there and prove it. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3935.04s)]
*  I think once you become champ, it's like, [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3936.48s)]
*  are you champ? [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3938.44s)]
*  You gotta defend the belt. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3939.28s)]
*  You gotta defend the fucking belt. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3940.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3941.96s)]
*  So I'm looking forward to that. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3942.8s)]
*  I really, really did truly want to fight in December. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3945.12s)]
*  Like when I called out Cheeto in December. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3947.96s)]
*  But then they talked to UFC and they kind of already had, [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3951.2s)]
*  they kind of already had, [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3954.04s)]
*  they were trying to get Colby Leon together [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3954.8799999999997s)]
*  and they didn't, I asked them, [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3956.3599999999997s)]
*  they want me to main event my own show, [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3957.96s)]
*  which I think is fucking dope. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3959.72s)]
*  I'm down with that. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3961.08s)]
*  So yeah, definitely. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3961.92s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good litmus test too. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3963.7599999999998s)]
*  Let's see what those numbers are [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3966.72s)]
*  because Cheeto's pretty famous too. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3967.72s)]
*  That's a big fight. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3969.68s)]
*  Yeah. I'm really hoping they fucking just say, [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3970.7999999999997s)]
*  let's fucking do it. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3973.6s)]
*  What do you think that would be for? [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3974.48s)]
*  Like when? [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3975.8s)]
*  It can't be December. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3979.2000000000003s)]
*  So what is the next big card after that? [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3980.52s)]
*  I'd say, I think UFC 300's in April. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3982.36s)]
*  I would say, I mean, that would be a sweet card to be on, [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3985.64s)]
*  but again, they're not gonna. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3988.56s)]
*  Where are they doing that, Vegas? [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3989.88s)]
*  Kind of have to. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3992.0s)]
*  Probably, yeah. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3992.84s)]
*  They should. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3993.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3994.52s)]
*  So I'm gonna get asked before that, [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3995.36s)]
*  before UFC 300, because they're not gonna put, [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=3997.28s)]
*  they'll probably do something like they're doing with John, [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4000.48s)]
*  have a super card, but only have to pay out one champion. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4002.3999999999996s)]
*  So I'm assuming they'll probably do something like that. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4006.2799999999997s)]
*  It's funny that you think about it that way. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4008.52s)]
*  I've been thinking like that. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4009.8799999999997s)]
*  Until you said that, I never considered it. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4011.04s)]
*  Oh yeah, that other fight, [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4013.6s)]
*  neither one of those guys is a current world champion, [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4015.08s)]
*  even though it's for the title, [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4017.24s)]
*  they don't get a piece of the pay-per-view. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4018.68s)]
*  I've been thinking, [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4020.2799999999997s)]
*  I've been having a business kind of mindset [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4021.2s)]
*  getting into fighting early, early on, [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4023.3999999999996s)]
*  thinking about numbers and brand deals. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4026.9199999999996s)]
*  And when I get to this position, [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4029.3999999999996s)]
*  what I'm gonna ask for at the UFC, [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4032.48s)]
*  and I go and sit down with Hunter [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4034.04s)]
*  and do our own negotiations and stuff, and it's fun. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4035.52s)]
*  I enjoy that aspect of fighting. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4039.7200000000003s)]
*  I enjoy the business side of it, [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4042.6800000000003s)]
*  to where a lot of fighters don't, [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4044.1200000000003s)]
*  they're like, here, I'll just pay someone to fucking do it, [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4045.48s)]
*  do it for me. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4048.28s)]
*  But I've always been excited about that. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4049.1200000000003s)]
*  I've always wanted to be into the entrepreneur type stuff. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4050.2000000000003s)]
*  Well, that's great that you enjoy it, [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4053.52s)]
*  because for some fighters, it's like a labor, [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4055.1200000000003s)]
*  and they don't do it. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4057.76s)]
*  But if you're excited about it, that's awesome, [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4058.6000000000004s)]
*  because that's definitely a smart thing. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4060.92s)]
*  And just the ability to promote, just promoting fights, [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4062.8s)]
*  that is such a factor. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4067.2000000000003s)]
*  There's so many guys that are really talented, [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4068.36s)]
*  but for whatever reason, [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4070.32s)]
*  the public's not captivated by them. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4071.36s)]
*  And so they just never quite hit their potential [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4073.6s)]
*  in terms of revenue. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4077.12s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4078.4s)]
*  I mean, it's crazy now with all the social media guys [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4080.36s)]
*  fighting now and making bank, [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4082.7200000000003s)]
*  and it's their first, second, third fights. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4084.92s)]
*  Jake Paul's the fucking man. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4086.6s)]
*  What he's done is pretty amazing. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4088.1600000000003s)]
*  Is that Dylan Dannis fight off with Logan Paul? [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4090.8s)]
*  I saw him tweet fucking him out piece or something, [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4093.2000000000003s)]
*  but then I seen someone confirm that he didn't pull out. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4095.1200000000003s)]
*  But that motherfucker, he's been calling us since the day [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4099.24s)]
*  when he said there's no way that motherfucker's showing up. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4101.08s)]

*  Jake Paul offers you more money, probably, [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4185.2s)]

*  Tim's used to girls having to fake it [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4375.12s)]
*  when he's having sex with them. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4376.5599999999995s)]
*  You're right, bitch. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4377.5599999999995s)]
*  Sounds like your fucking gym. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4378.48s)]
*  God, how much is social media these days [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4380.22s)]
*  affecting marriage? [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4382.38s)]
*  I wonder what the percentage of success rate in marriage [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4383.900000000001s)]
*  is gonna be in about five years. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4386.4800000000005s)]
*  That's a really good question [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4387.9400000000005s)]
*  because I was watching YouTube the other day [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4388.900000000001s)]
*  and a clip popped up that I didn't watch, [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4391.66s)]
*  but it was Lex Friedman had some guy on [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4394.76s)]
*  and the guy was explaining how Instagram [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4397.64s)]
*  is essentially an infidelity accelerating machine. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4400.02s)]
*  Because if you think of like, [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4405.12s)]
*  Makes sense. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4406.62s)]
*  I know guys who are married [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4408.42s)]
*  and their wife's page is all their wife [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4410.94s)]
*  sticking their titties out and sticking their butt out. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4414.34s)]
*  I mean, it's literally the whole page. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4417.46s)]
*  It's like these girls, [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4419.46s)]
*  and I'm not talking about girls [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4420.54s)]
*  who are like professional fitness influencers [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4422.34s)]
*  that are just showing how good their body is. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4425.26s)]
*  I'm just talking about just regular gals. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4427.86s)]
*  Like if you're a professional fitness person [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4430.9s)]
*  and maybe you train people or something like that, [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4432.94s)]
*  yeah, of course you should show your body. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4434.9s)]
*  That's what everybody wants. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4436.4s)]
*  You're literally advertising, [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4437.8s)]
*  but look, I did this to me, [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4439.44s)]
*  I can help you do this to you. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4441.66s)]
*  But some of them are just ass and titties [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4443.179999999999s)]
*  and like, do you like my feet? [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4446.24s)]
*  And like they're married, right? [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4449.5199999999995s)]
*  So you know they're getting bombed on the DMs, [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4451.44s)]
*  like constantly. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4454.679999999999s)]
*  And if something goes wrong in the marriage, [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4455.88s)]
*  they have like probably so many options, [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4458.04s)]
*  like pro athletes are DMing them and who knows? [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4460.719999999999s)]
*  God, same with the guys too. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4465.2s)]
*  How easily those relationships are just available. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4467.400000000001s)]
*  What I was talking about that last night [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4469.64s)]
*  with the dating apps, [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4471.04s)]
*  like when someone in one of those [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4472.16s)]
*  bottom of the barrel shows, [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4474.64s)]
*  one of the questions was hinge, [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4475.96s)]
*  which was a dating app. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4478.360000000001s)]
*  And I was like, how much are you gonna be invested [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4479.76s)]
*  in trying to figure somebody out [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4482.68s)]
*  if you've got like 100 people that you swiped on [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4484.06s)]
*  that are also ready to go? [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4487.400000000001s)]
*  And then you could just like leave the state, [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4489.56s)]
*  sucks, like text this person, [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4491.280000000001s)]
*  like, hey, something just came up, [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4493.52s)]
*  I just get out of a meeting, [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4496.08s)]
*  do you wanna go have a late drink? [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4497.84s)]
*  And then you go meet that person, [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4499.64s)]
*  like, all right, we're trying again. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4501.16s)]
*  And then if you're really that person, [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4502.5199999999995s)]
*  that's like, it's gotta be addictive [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4504.76s)]
*  like everything else on social media is addictive. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4506.92s)]
*  So, and addicted to just meeting people [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4509.2s)]
*  and just swiping and they all look hot, [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4512.0s)]
*  like let's fucking go. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4513.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's dangerous. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4515.2s)]
*  I mean, marriage is such a tough, crazy thing. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4516.16s)]
*  Do you know a lot of people [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4518.24s)]
*  that have successful marriages? [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4519.08s)]
*  I know people that have successful marriages. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4521.68s)]
*  I wouldn't say I know a lot. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4523.68s)]
*  I think, look, what is the divorce rate? [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4525.36s)]
*  We know that. 40 something percent? [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4528.04s)]
*  I think it's higher. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4529.2s)]
*  I think the national divorce rate is close to 50%. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4530.04s)]
*  And Chris Rock always had a great bit about that. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4532.4s)]
*  He goes, and that's just the people [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4534.08s)]
*  that had the courage to get out. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4536.16s)]
*  How many cowards stay and suffer? [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4538.599999999999s)]
*  Especially when they have kids [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4542.44s)]
*  and they're just staying together, [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4543.639999999999s)]
*  being miserable with kids. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4544.639999999999s)]
*  And they don't even know those kids are sitting there [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4546.48s)]
*  looking at how they interact with each other. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4548.639999999999s)]
*  It's just affecting them. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4550.5599999999995s)]
*  They just feel the interactions if it's not genuine. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4551.599999999999s)]
*  Just there for the kids, like fuck. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4554.96s)]
*  Yeah, if they feel like a bitterness between them. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4557.16s)]
*  And then also they'll identify [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4559.719999999999s)]
*  future relationships like that too. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4561.4s)]
*  That's like a scary thing about people [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4563.759999999999s)]
*  who grow up in abusive households. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4565.16s)]
*  If the mother and father are abusive to each other, [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4568.36s)]
*  verbally abusive to each other, [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4570.599999999999s)]
*  then they'll probably pattern that as they get older. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4572.0s)]
*  And they just think you're supposed to fight [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4575.48s)]
*  and then make up, fight and then make up. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4578.36s)]
*  And then people get caught up in that cycle [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4580.639999999999s)]
*  of fighting and make up. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4582.599999999999s)]
*  Because it feels good to make up. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4583.8s)]
*  And the make up sex is amazing. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4586.12s)]
*  But the fighting part is just like people get brutal, [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4588.0s)]
*  they insult each other and break each other down. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4591.2s)]
*  Yeah, we're so lucky [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4595.2s)]
*  because I've been with my girl almost 13 years now [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4596.04s)]
*  and you've been with Danny for almost 10. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4598.52s)]
*  But I bet being the star you are now [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4600.6s)]
*  trying to find a chick that, [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4602.64s)]
*  I mean the guys that are stars [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4603.92s)]
*  trying to find actual love. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4605.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it'd be tough. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4607.400000000001s)]
*  It's possible. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4608.24s)]
*  I think it's probably easier [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4609.16s)]
*  if you're a guy to find a good girl [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4610.68s)]
*  than you're for a girl to find a good guy. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4612.68s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4615.08s)]
*  I would think so. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4616.64s)]
*  Because, I mean, to be sexist, [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4617.72s)]
*  to talk in sexist terms, [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4623.280000000001s)]
*  women think of a man as a provider. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4625.200000000001s)]
*  Like, so you want a guy who can keep it together. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4628.08s)]
*  Right, you want a guy who, [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4630.16s)]
*  you're gonna have children, [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4631.400000000001s)]
*  you're gonna want a guy who's gonna be able [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4632.56s)]
*  to keep it together financially, [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4634.0s)]
*  be stable, be disciplined, [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4635.64s)]
*  do all the things he's gonna do, [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4637.64s)]
*  not fall apart, not become a drug addict, [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4638.56s)]
*  not fucking do something really stupid [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4640.88s)]
*  and lose his job and not just give up because of that [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4643.08s)]
*  and then everybody gets on welfare. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4647.12s)]
*  Like, you have to count on someone [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4648.88s)]
*  unless you wanna work yourself. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4650.88s)]
*  So there's this evolutionary aspect. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4652.56s)]
*  And I think it's hard. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4656.32s)]
*  Like, if you're a guy, [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4657.76s)]
*  what do you want out of a woman? [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4659.04s)]
*  I want her to be nice. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4660.92s)]
*  A fat ass. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4662.400000000001s)]
*  I want her to be interesting, a fat ass. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4663.24s)]
*  All the physical things. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4664.12s)]
*  But you want her to be a good person, a nice person. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4665.64s)]
*  I don't need them to be successful. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4667.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4669.28s)]
*  Like, no guy cares. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4670.16s)]
*  I do not care at all. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4670.96s)]
*  Like, I would not care at all. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4672.88s)]
*  Like, if I was a single guy and I met a gal [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4674.04s)]
*  and she was like a bartender, [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4676.44s)]
*  I did want to be like, oh, just a bartender. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4677.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good point. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4679.48s)]
*  You don't have any businesses. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4680.32s)]
*  Like, no one cares. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4681.5599999999995s)]
*  No one cares. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4682.48s)]

*  Are you fun to be with? [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4685.82s)]
*  Do I enjoy spending time with you? [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4686.66s)]
*  Then who cares? [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4687.5599999999995s)]
*  So, but a woman like Taylor Swift [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4688.72s)]
*  is not gonna marry a bartender. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4691.12s)]
*  Right? [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4692.599999999999s)]
*  That's fucking so true. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4693.44s)]
*  Bitch, get the fuck out of here. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4694.4s)]
*  I sell out stadiums. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4695.64s)]

*  Gotta do something big time. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4702.099999999999s)]
*  You're gonna share a glass. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4703.66s)]
*  That's a good point. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4704.5s)]
*  Thought about that. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4705.32s)]
*  Yeah, who knows? [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4706.42s)]
*  I think it's a tough road for a woman to find a good man. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4709.46s)]
*  That's what I think. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4711.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4713.0599999999995s)]
*  If I'm guessing. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4713.9s)]
*  Because I don't know that many good men. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4714.72s)]
*  I know a lot of cool women. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4717.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4718.74s)]

*  like how many of them are going for it. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4723.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4725.4s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4727.66s)]
*  I meet a lot of cool people. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4728.5s)]
*  Just like general folks. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4730.0s)]
*  How many of these general folks are keeping it together? [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4731.0s)]
*  There's lazy fucks. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4733.0s)]
*  A lot of lazy fucks. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4733.96s)]
*  I feel like comedians, [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4735.5199999999995s)]
*  is there a lot of lazy comedians [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4736.92s)]
*  that are naturally funny that could be way better [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4738.4s)]
*  that just kind of just get by with the little funniness? [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4740.639999999999s)]
*  There's that. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4743.98s)]
*  There's some guys that are talented [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4744.88s)]
*  and they don't apply themselves enough. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4746.5599999999995s)]
*  Because Hans, we were talking to Hans Kim [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4748.5199999999995s)]
*  and he was like, [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4750.2s)]
*  Kill Tony makes him kind of have to fucking, [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4751.759999999999s)]
*  a minute every week to where he can't be lazy. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4754.32s)]
*  But he said if he didn't, he would probably be lazy. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4756.92s)]
*  That's crazy that you just know that, [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4760.12s)]
*  well I'd probably be lazy, that mindset. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4761.64s)]
*  It's weird people. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4763.2s)]
*  You gotta work out with Hans and you see what he's talking about. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4764.04s)]
*  Hans is fucked. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4765.5599999999995s)]
*  He goes to the gym and it's like, [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4767.0s)]
*  you lazy bitch, what are you doing? [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4768.5599999999995s)]
*  Go to work. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4770.96s)]
*  Hans is so fucked. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4771.8s)]
*  People don't like correlate the two, [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4772.62s)]
*  like creativity and health. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4773.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't think they have anything to do with each other. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4775.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4777.5599999999995s)]
*  It's that mind body thing. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4778.4s)]
*  Like people who concentrate only on the mind, [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4779.599999999999s)]
*  think the body's frivolous [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4781.58s)]
*  and they don't care what they look like. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4783.12s)]
*  And then people concentrate only on the body. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4784.32s)]
*  They're not thinking about their mind. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4786.48s)]
*  But they're interconnected. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4788.36s)]
*  It's your being. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4789.679999999999s)]
*  Your being is your body and your mind. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4791.12s)]
*  They're all contained in the same vessel. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4792.88s)]
*  And if you can keep that vessel healthy and happy [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4794.679999999999s)]
*  and keep it on track, you'll have a better life. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4797.799999999999s)]
*  Is there a certain time when you have your best ideas [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4800.84s)]
*  and stuff? [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4803.4s)]
*  At night. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4804.24s)]
*  Almost always at night. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4805.0599999999995s)]
*  But sometimes in the morning, [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4806.04s)]
*  sometimes I'll spark a fucking dooba [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4807.2s)]
*  right when I wake up and start writing. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4809.5199999999995s)]
*  It just depends on how I feel. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4812.08s)]
*  Like I do allow, as long as I get my work done, [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4813.94s)]
*  what I need to get done, like exercise [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4816.68s)]
*  and writing and all that stuff, [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4818.88s)]
*  I'll allow it sometimes to happen at different times. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4820.200000000001s)]
*  So sometimes I'll wake up in the morning and I just have, [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4822.8s)]
*  I just wake up and I'm like, I gotta write right now. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4824.8s)]
*  I got some ideas. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4827.54s)]
*  And then I'll get high and sit in front of the computer [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4829.0s)]
*  for a couple hours. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4831.280000000001s)]
*  And sometimes it's coming after the club. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4832.12s)]
*  Like some of the best shit I've ever written [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4835.08s)]
*  is like I went off stage, I got home, [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4836.68s)]
*  and I just sat down and started going over ideas [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4839.16s)]
*  and then come up with things. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4841.400000000001s)]
*  God, that's so sweet that that's your club. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4843.240000000001s)]
*  When we were watching last night on the balcony [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4844.92s)]
*  and looking down at you performing in your club, [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4847.4400000000005s)]
*  I was like, that's fucking so sweet. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4848.280000000001s)]
*  That's so sweet. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4849.92s)]
*  That's like a dream come true. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4851.72s)]
*  It's not even a dream I ever had. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4853.320000000001s)]
*  It really just happened? [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4854.92s)]
*  I had to do it once we got here. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4855.76s)]
*  So I needed to get the fuck out of LA. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4857.88s)]
*  The George Floyd riots were happening. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4860.360000000001s)]
*  They're defunding the police. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4862.68s)]
*  They're telling you you can't do standup. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4864.200000000001s)]
*  You can't go to restaurants. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4866.0s)]
*  You can't do anything. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4867.240000000001s)]
*  And I was starting to get really sketched out. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4868.4800000000005s)]
*  And I've always wanted, at the time my youngest kids [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4870.52s)]
*  were 10 and 12, which I felt like is the age [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4873.64s)]
*  that you can still move them and they'll be okay. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4878.72s)]
*  When you start moving kids at 15 and 16, [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4881.360000000001s)]
*  they really resent it because they're socially connected [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4884.72s)]
*  to their friends. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4887.240000000001s)]
*  They're going to high school. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4888.08s)]
*  If they like their high school [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4889.200000000001s)]
*  and they like their friends, it sucks. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4890.52s)]
*  So it was perfect. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4893.04s)]
*  They met friends early. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4894.8s)]
*  It was like the people here are so friendly. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4896.64s)]
*  And it was like immediate. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4899.96s)]
*  I was like, I love it here. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4901.4400000000005s)]
*  I feel so home. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4904.4s)]
*  But there was no real comedy club. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4906.32s)]
*  There was this place, The Vulcan, but the sound sucked. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4909.04s)]
*  And it was like, there was always issues. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4911.599999999999s)]
*  And so we used The Vulcan as a place to practice. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4913.679999999999s)]
*  And it was good because then we would go on the road [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4916.5599999999995s)]
*  on the weekends. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4918.599999999999s)]
*  We were doing arenas and all these comedy shows. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4919.44s)]
*  But right away I was like, I need to open up a club. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4922.44s)]
*  And Ron White told me to buy that, [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4926.24s)]
*  the building that was owned by the cult. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4929.679999999999s)]
*  We're going to watch that after this. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4932.280000000001s)]
*  You've been fucking. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4933.6s)]
*  I'm pumped. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4934.4400000000005s)]
*  I love cult shows. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4935.280000000001s)]
*  Cult shows are good, motivating. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4936.72s)]
*  I almost owned that building. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4938.080000000001s)]
*  I was under contract for that building. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4940.240000000001s)]
*  It wasn't for their issues. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4942.120000000001s)]
*  I feel like the one you got is fucking perfect. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4943.64s)]
*  Because was it on the same street? [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4945.96s)]
*  No, no. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4947.6s)]
*  The one that I had is on this big property. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4949.120000000001s)]
*  It's way off the beaten path. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4951.120000000001s)]
*  Oh, this is perfect then, huh? [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4952.4400000000005s)]
*  Oh yeah, this is perfect because I'm getting all the people [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4953.96s)]
*  that are in the hotels downtown. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4955.72s)]
*  They can just walk there. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4957.0s)]
*  All the foot traffic. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4958.280000000001s)]
*  And on 6th Street in front of my club [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4959.96s)]
*  at Friday and Saturday, they shut the whole street down. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4961.96s)]
*  Bro, Tuesday night last night, I was like, what the fuck? [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4964.4800000000005s)]
*  I feel like a weekend. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4967.28s)]
*  It was crazy. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4968.12s)]
*  The line out the door was insane. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4968.96s)]
*  Always. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4971.32s)]
*  That's so fucking sweet. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4971.88s)]
*  And we've revitalized that area. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4973.0s)]
*  That's sweet. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4975.6s)]
*  And so other stuff is booming there too. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4976.12s)]
*  And there's a big development company that's bought off. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4978.28s)]
*  They bought up a giant chunk of 6th Street. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4980.96s)]
*  And they have all these amazing plans. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4983.04s)]
*  Fuck yeah. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4985.04s)]
*  So it's really exciting. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4985.52s)]
*  Was it stressful building that place out? [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4986.52s)]
*  Stressful is being poor. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4992.4400000000005s)]
*  I was going to say you better now. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4993.76s)]
*  Stressful is coal mining to feed your kids [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4995.160000000001s)]
*  when you're already getting black lung. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4998.040000000001s)]
*  What I had to do was complicated. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=4999.92s)]
*  But I wouldn't say it was stressful [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5002.120000000001s)]
*  because it didn't hurt me financially. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5003.88s)]
*  I knew that it's very rare. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5006.160000000001s)]
*  It's like sometimes things happen in life where you go, [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5008.320000000001s)]
*  God, if I don't do this, who's going to? [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5011.320000000001s)]
*  Who's going to do it other than me? [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5013.68s)]
*  It seems like the world wants me to do this. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5015.36s)]
*  So I knocked out Aljo. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5017.24s)]
*  Ah! [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5018.28s)]
*  So it's just I felt like, look, this is the thing to do. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5022.12s)]
*  I opened up a badass comedy club. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5025.0s)]
*  And at the same time, all my friends [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5026.599999999999s)]
*  that worked for the comedy store were unemployed [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5029.24s)]
*  because the comedy store had shut down. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5031.96s)]
*  And so they weren't getting any money. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5033.719999999999s)]
*  And I was like, how about I just hire you guys, [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5035.2s)]
*  move you all out here, and let's build a club together? [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5037.4s)]
*  That's so sweet. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5040.759999999999s)]
*  And that's what we did. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5041.4s)]
*  Fucking insane community. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5042.28s)]
*  We did it the right way. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5043.08s)]
*  It was so fun hanging up there, like David Lucas, William, [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5044.24s)]
*  Hans, Tony, just feeling like a part of the group [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5047.16s)]
*  for a little bit. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5049.8s)]
*  It was fucking really fun. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5050.599999999999s)]
*  That was a good time. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5051.84s)]
*  It's a real fun ha- it's like we- it's like, [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5052.76s)]
*  if you could hang with your boys and have [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5055.72s)]
*  the best night of your life, a point where you're thinking [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5057.5599999999995s)]
*  about it months later, we'd do that every night. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5060.08s)]
*  Belly laughing. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5062.44s)]
*  Every night. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5063.16s)]
*  And it's all professional convenience. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5064.24s)]
*  We're all constantly talking shit and laughing. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5065.92s)]
*  But it's almost like podcasts, too, [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5068.8s)]
*  because the conversations will segue in interesting things. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5070.4s)]
*  Someone will bring something up, and they'll be all [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5073.16s)]
*  talking about it, and we're playing music. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5075.12s)]
*  Heading down to Mitzi's after his phone, the bar. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5077.2s)]
*  That was really fun, too. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5079.64s)]
*  Not usually go to bars. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5081.5599999999995s)]
*  Just makes it that much more sweet. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5082.5199999999995s)]
*  There's just no phones, too. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5083.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5085.28s)]
*  Just something about it. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5085.76s)]
*  Oh, that's cool. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5086.24s)]
*  I like that. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5086.72s)]
*  Being able to take the phones away and lock those things up, [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5087.36s)]
*  that's fucking sweet. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5089.44s)]
*  Yeah, people don't like it, but man, it makes you pay attention, [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5090.08s)]
*  and it makes the experience way better. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5092.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5093.8s)]
*  And if you accidentally say a little something, [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5094.28s)]
*  you're all right. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5096.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5097.16s)]
*  It just makes it better for everybody. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5098.44s)]
*  That's what they have to understand. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5100.16s)]
*  People are reluctant to do it, but listen, [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5101.36s)]
*  it's better for the art form. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5103.4s)]
*  It's better for you. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5104.92s)]
*  Just go and have a good time. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5106.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5107.48s)]
*  I like how they lock them for real. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5107.799999999999s)]
*  I went to the balcony, I went to just grab mine, [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5109.32s)]
*  and I was like, oh shit, I think it's locked in that motherfucker, [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5112.4s)]
*  which is cool, but I like that. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5115.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5117.48s)]
*  We did everything that we could to make it the best [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5118.599999999999s)]
*  experience possible for the comedians, [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5120.599999999999s)]
*  the best for the audience. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5122.88s)]
*  We just did it right. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5124.28s)]
*  Took a long time. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5126.24s)]
*  Can a person that's not really naturally that funny [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5127.639999999999s)]
*  become a great comedian? [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5130.48s)]
*  It's a good question. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5132.2s)]
*  I don't think it's impossible. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5133.16s)]
*  I think if you're smart and you can figure it out, [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5134.639999999999s)]
*  I think people can figure things out. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5136.799999999999s)]
*  It's like, I think there's a certain mindset [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5139.12s)]
*  that you would have to acquire, and I think some people, [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5141.679999999999s)]
*  it's very difficult for them to change the way they look at things [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5145.5599999999995s)]
*  and change the way they think other people see them, [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5148.4s)]
*  because people have a delusional idea of how other people see you. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5152.2s)]
*  And I think in comedy, sometimes you have to approach, [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5155.44s)]
*  you have to think of it in a different way. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5158.719999999999s)]
*  You have to think of it as an audience, [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5161.32s)]
*  as much as you have to think of it as yourself. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5163.32s)]
*  Such a sweet skill. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5165.32s)]
*  I've tried to write shit down, [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5166.32s)]
*  and I look at it a couple weeks later, I'm like, [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5168.32s)]
*  what the fuck? [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5170.32s)]
*  I thought that was funny, even a little bit. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5172.32s)]
*  It wasn't. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5175.32s)]
*  Well, it's like anything else, man. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5177.32s)]
*  You've got to do it around a bunch of people who do it. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5179.32s)]
*  In our case, you literally have to practice it [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5182.32s)]
*  in front of audiences. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5185.32s)]
*  Some of the stuff you saw last night was brand new. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5188.24s)]
*  One of the bits I did last night I had just done for the first time [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5191.24s)]
*  during the first show, [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5194.24s)]
*  and then there's all the stuff that we do in that little room [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5196.24s)]
*  at the bottom of the barrel that's completely improvised. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5199.24s)]
*  And so that's how you develop an act, [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5201.24s)]
*  by just you have to practice it live in front of people. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5204.24s)]
*  So I have these ideas. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5208.24s)]
*  How many times do you do something in the barrel room, [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5210.24s)]
*  or when you're doing the barrel show, [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5212.24s)]
*  that's fucking good, but you can't write it down, [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5214.24s)]
*  or someone recording just in case? [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5217.16s)]
*  I record everything. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5219.16s)]
*  Just in case you're like, fuck, what was that? [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5221.16s)]
*  I always record them, and then I listen to them, [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5223.16s)]
*  and every now and then there's a little thing that you forgot. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5225.16s)]
*  You're like, oh shit! [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5227.16s)]
*  That's funny, or can be. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5229.16s)]
*  They're like little seeds. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5231.16s)]
*  I'm like, I'm going to water this bitch. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5233.16s)]
*  A couple of them yesterday. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5235.16s)]
*  Obviously we won't say anything right now, [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5237.16s)]
*  but that shit had me fucking laughing. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5239.16s)]
*  I wonder what Tom Segura and Christina P, [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5241.16s)]
*  what their home life's like, [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5243.16s)]
*  they're such high level comedians. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5245.16s)]
*  They're talking shit all day. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5247.16s)]
*  They've got kids too, right? [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5249.16s)]
*  Their kids talk shit. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5251.16s)]
*  I'm going to bet. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5253.16s)]
*  One kid calls him Tom, he won't call his dad, [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5255.16s)]
*  and he goes, hey, I'm your fucking dad. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5257.16s)]
*  Call me dad. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5259.16s)]
*  He's like, alright, Tom. Settle down, Tom. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5261.16s)]
*  They live out here. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5263.16s)]
*  They both live here too. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5265.16s)]
*  Yeah, their podcast is fucking funny. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5267.16s)]
*  There's like 15 world class comedians [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5269.16s)]
*  that moved to Austin over the last three years. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5271.16s)]
*  Anywhere would definitely be Austin. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5273.16s)]
*  I couldn't leave around this though. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5275.16s)]
*  I would get too distracted. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5277.16s)]
*  What, around 6th Street? [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5279.16s)]
*  Just around town. I live in Waddell. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5281.16s)]
*  I just got a farm. I got 15 chickens. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5283.16s)]
*  I live out. I have to. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5285.16s)]
*  I know myself. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5287.16s)]
*  That's how I lived when I lived in California. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5289.16s)]
*  I lived about 35 minutes outside of LA. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5291.16s)]
*  Do you have chickens now? [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5293.16s)]
*  Yes, I do. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5295.16s)]
*  I'm recently a chicken guy. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5297.16s)]
*  They've been starting to lay eggs, [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5299.16s)]
*  every morning. It's something about [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5301.16s)]
*  grabbing the egg and cracking it. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5303.16s)]
*  So nutritious too. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5305.16s)]
*  We've been getting a bunch, giving them some. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5307.16s)]
*  Ours haven't started laying eggs yet. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5309.16s)]
*  We've got fresh chickens. They're only now [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5311.16s)]
*  a couple months old. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5313.16s)]
*  They're getting their feathers and getting all the fluff [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5315.16s)]
*  that's starting to go away. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5317.16s)]
*  They're rich and colorful. Way different. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5319.16s)]
*  The eggs. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5321.16s)]
*  I'm watching them walk around outside. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5323.16s)]
*  I'm so stumped about it. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5325.16s)]
*  You ever see what they do to mice? [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5327.16s)]
*  I have. I've heard they're fucking savages. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5329.16s)]
*  You've never seen a video of a chicken fucking up a mountain? [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5331.16s)]
*  I don't know if I want to. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5333.16s)]
*  This is how I found out about it. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5335.16s)]
*  We had this fence in California. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5337.16s)]
*  There was this wrought iron fence in our backyard. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5341.16s)]
*  My wife said, you know what? [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5343.16s)]
*  That fence kind of fucks up our view. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5345.16s)]
*  Why don't we get a glass fence? [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5347.16s)]
*  So we got a glass fence. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5349.16s)]
*  Then hawks couldn't figure out [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5351.16s)]
*  there was a glass fence. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5353.16s)]
*  And there was like three of them. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5355.16s)]
*  That wound up dead. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5357.16s)]
*  They got KO'd. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5359.16s)]
*  And one of them got KO'd. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5361.16s)]
*  But he was still lying in the backyard. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5363.16s)]
*  So my wife and my kids rescued him. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5365.16s)]
*  So they put him in a box. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5367.16s)]
*  Watch this cat with this mouse. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5369.16s)]
*  So this cat is playing around with this mouse. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5371.16s)]
*  Oh no. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5373.16s)]
*  Watch this chicken. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5375.16s)]
*  No way. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5377.16s)]
*  Yeah. The chicken is way more savage than that cat. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5379.16s)]
*  Oh shit. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5381.16s)]
*  Just fucking that mouse up. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5383.16s)]
*  This Brit. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5385.16s)]
*  Get the fuck out of here cat. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5387.16s)]
*  This is mine. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5389.16s)]
*  The cat is like, you got it. Leave me alone. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5391.16s)]
*  Chickens are funny bro. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5393.16s)]
*  So what happened was [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5395.16s)]
*  this hawk got fucked up. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5397.16s)]
*  They put him in this big box. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5399.16s)]
*  Put him in the bottom of the box. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5401.16s)]
*  Then my wife went to the pet store. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5403.16s)]
*  They got these, I think they called them pinkies. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5405.16s)]
*  They're like little baby mice. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5407.16s)]
*  They feed the snakes and shit like that. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5409.16s)]
*  They got a bunch of them. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5411.16s)]
*  They fed a bunch of them to this hawk. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5413.16s)]
*  He ate them all except for one. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5415.16s)]
*  There was one left. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5417.16s)]
*  My daughter was like, there were only like four. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5419.16s)]
*  We want to raise it. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5421.16s)]
*  It doesn't have its mother. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5423.16s)]
*  It's going to die. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5425.16s)]
*  Let's just feed it to the chickens. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5427.16s)]
*  No. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5429.16s)]
*  I go, that doesn't make any sense. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5431.16s)]
*  You just fed it to the hawk. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5433.16s)]
*  But now you don't want to feed it to the chickens? [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5435.16s)]
*  The chickens are our friends. They give us eggs. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5437.16s)]
*  The hawk is just some flying monster [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5439.16s)]
*  that kills all the rats. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5441.16s)]
*  Eventually they said, okay. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5443.16s)]
*  I go, do you guys want to come with me? [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5445.16s)]
*  No. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5447.16s)]
*  I went out in the chicken coop by myself. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5449.16s)]
*  I put that thing down and they dove on it. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5451.16s)]
*  Like piranhas. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5453.16s)]
*  One got in in her beak [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5455.16s)]
*  and she's running around the chicken coop. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5457.16s)]
*  All of them are chasing after her [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5459.16s)]
*  and biting at her face [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5461.16s)]
*  and trying to steal the mouse from her. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5463.16s)]
*  I've never seen anything like it. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5465.16s)]
*  Every other time they eat, [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5467.16s)]
*  if we serve them chicken feed [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5469.16s)]
*  and we serve them dried worms [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5471.16s)]
*  and all these different things, [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5473.16s)]
*  they peck at it but they don't steal from each other. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5475.16s)]
*  They're frantic. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5477.16s)]
*  But they knew that that fresh meat, [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5479.16s)]
*  the fresh meat of mice, [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5481.16s)]
*  for whatever reason, that is their favorite thing. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5483.16s)]
*  They went crazy, man. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5485.16s)]
*  It was wild to see. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5487.16s)]
*  What a perfect animal for... [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5489.16s)]
*  They've been around for millions and millions of years. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5491.16s)]
*  They lay food every day. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5493.16s)]
*  It's a perfect animal. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5495.16s)]
*  That's what they put down there for us. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5497.16s)]
*  If you're a person that has a good relationship [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5499.16s)]
*  with that chicken, [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5501.16s)]
*  like all these people that are vegan, [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5503.16s)]
*  that's like, I would never eat eggs. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5505.16s)]
*  Listen, it's not going to be a chicken. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5507.16s)]
*  It can't be a chicken. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5509.16s)]
*  You don't have a rooster, it's not going to be a chicken. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5511.16s)]
*  It's just food. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5513.16s)]
*  It's food from your pets. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5515.16s)]
*  You have a good relationship with them, [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5517.16s)]
*  give them corn and feed. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5519.16s)]
*  Let them arrange around your yard, eat bugs and all that stuff. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5521.16s)]
*  You'll get this unbelievably nutritious food for free. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5523.16s)]
*  It's animal protein, so you don't have to be a fucking sick person. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5525.16s)]
*  You don't have to be like, [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5527.16s)]
*  protein deficient [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5529.16s)]
*  and feeling terrible [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5531.16s)]
*  and having to supplement everything with fucking soy [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5533.16s)]
*  and this and that. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5535.16s)]
*  You can eat eggs. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5537.16s)]
*  How many times a day are you eating meat? [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5539.16s)]
*  Every day. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5541.16s)]
*  How many times a day? [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5543.16s)]
*  Every meal, and I'm eating probably twice a day. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5545.16s)]
*  Generally, I don't eat more than twice a day. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5547.16s)]
*  I don't usually eat lunch. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5549.16s)]
*  Usually lunch is my breakfast. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5551.16s)]
*  It's the first meal I have in the day is around noon. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5553.16s)]
*  Even days you train hard? [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5555.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5557.16s)]
*  I don't mind training on an empty stomach, [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5559.16s)]
*  but I will have a piece of fruit or something like that [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5561.16s)]
*  if I know I'm really going to get after it. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5563.16s)]
*  A lot of electrolytes too. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5565.16s)]
*  The thing for me is, [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5567.16s)]
*  everybody's different. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5569.16s)]
*  I know people that are fine with a vegetarian diet. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5571.16s)]
*  It's not me though. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5573.16s)]
*  When I used to try to lose weight when I was competing, [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5575.16s)]
*  I was trying to make 140 pounds [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5577.16s)]
*  and I only made it one year, [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5579.16s)]
*  and I couldn't do it again. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5581.16s)]
*  It was just too hard. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5583.16s)]
*  I tried vegetarianism for six months. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5585.16s)]
*  I just felt listless. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5587.16s)]
*  I wasn't doing it well. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5589.16s)]
*  I wasn't even taking supplements back then. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5591.16s)]
*  I just didn't want to go up to the next weight class. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5593.16s)]
*  Then when I made the decision to go up to the next weight class, [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5595.16s)]
*  I started eating meat. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5597.16s)]
*  It was like... [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5599.16s)]
*  immediately. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5601.16s)]
*  Because I was 17. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5603.16s)]
*  My body was like, [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5605.16s)]
*  hey bitch, we're trying to get stronger. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5607.16s)]
*  What are you doing giving us corn? [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5609.16s)]
*  From then on, [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5613.16s)]
*  I would say, God, when I eat meat, I feel better. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5615.16s)]
*  I know that I didn't do that well. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5617.16s)]
*  I know I haven't tried it since. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5619.16s)]
*  But when I went on a full carnivore diet [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5621.16s)]
*  a few years ago for a month, [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5623.16s)]
*  where I ate nothing but meat for a month, [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5625.16s)]
*  I was like, God, this is the best I've ever felt. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5627.16s)]
*  Now I've been doing that for three solid months. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5629.16s)]
*  Three and a half almost. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5633.16s)]
*  Three and a half solid months of nothing but meat. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5635.16s)]
*  I feel great. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5637.16s)]
*  I don't know how you don't eat those cheeseburgers [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5639.16s)]
*  from that fucking... [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5641.16s)]
*  God, I keep forgetting what it's called. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5643.16s)]
*  That thing still has me thinking about a fucking [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5645.16s)]
*  ex-girlfriend. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5647.16s)]
*  God, that twinker. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5649.16s)]
*  Well, that's Philip. Philip Franklin Lee is the man. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5651.16s)]
*  Michelin star chef who decided to make [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5653.16s)]
*  the perfect cheeseburger. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5655.16s)]
*  He uses Wagyu patties. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5657.16s)]
*  So it's like choice. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5659.16s)]
*  Top of the line beef. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5661.16s)]
*  He knows exactly how to cook them. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5663.16s)]
*  American singles. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5665.16s)]
*  He's like, that's the perfect cheese for these burgers. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5667.16s)]
*  You want this kind of melty cheese product. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5669.16s)]
*  Not like an actual piece of cheese. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5671.16s)]
*  Because it's not even really cheese. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5673.16s)]
*  Everything's perfect. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5675.16s)]
*  Look at that thing. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5677.16s)]
*  It's so soft and just perfect. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5679.16s)]
*  There's not too much going on. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5681.16s)]
*  It was just wrapped up nicely warm. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5683.16s)]
*  So we are doing a collaboration. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5685.16s)]
*  There's a company that I work with called Senior Lechuga [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5687.16s)]
*  that makes sensational [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5689.16s)]
*  small batch hot sauces. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5691.16s)]
*  And Senior Lechuga [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5693.16s)]
*  we're now putting those sauces [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5695.16s)]
*  in a not a damn chance burger. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5697.16s)]
*  So it's a triple patty because I'm a glutton. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5699.16s)]
*  And it's got bacon. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5701.16s)]
*  And it's got pickles and onions [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5703.16s)]
*  and tomatoes. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5705.16s)]
*  Triple patty. Smashed. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5707.16s)]
*  That's fun. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5709.16s)]
*  That's fun. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5711.16s)]
*  Do you get your blood work looked at and stuff? [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5713.16s)]
*  Yeah, all the time. And it's always looking healthy [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5715.16s)]
*  from the carnivore. Yeah, it's great. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5717.16s)]
*  I wonder how many people, I wonder if it's just [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5719.16s)]
*  genetics. I think it is. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5721.16s)]
*  You got to figure it out what's best for you. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5723.16s)]
*  Yeah, I think the way your ancestors evolved [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5725.16s)]
*  has a significant effect. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5727.16s)]
*  Make a lot of sense. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5729.16s)]
*  I think it's just natural. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5731.16s)]
*  Like if you were from the north or you were born and raised in Mexico? [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5733.16s)]
*  But I think also [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5735.16s)]
*  meat is [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5737.16s)]
*  the most nutrient dense food in the world. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5739.16s)]
*  I mean especially game meat. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5741.16s)]
*  It's so filled with game meat. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5743.16s)]
*  A lot of heat. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5745.16s)]
*  They're eating gays. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5747.16s)]
*  They're slower and they tend [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5749.16s)]
*  to give up quicker. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5751.16s)]
*  Some of them are passive. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5753.16s)]
*  So I eat them. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5755.16s)]
*  Game meat. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5757.16s)]
*  You know, because I hunt. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5759.16s)]
*  So I get all this elk meat [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5761.16s)]
*  and deer meat. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5763.16s)]
*  I think there's a significant factor in that too. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5765.16s)]
*  Because it's just so [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5767.16s)]
*  fucking good for you. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5769.16s)]
*  It just feels good for you when you're eating it. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5771.16s)]
*  I feel like it makes sense. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5773.16s)]
*  Better than a fat fucking cow that's just roaming around. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5775.16s)]
*  Dude, the color of a [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5777.16s)]
*  fresh fucking elk tenderloin [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5779.16s)]
*  is crazy compared to [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5781.16s)]
*  a dying fat cow. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5783.16s)]
*  Yeah, when I cut elk steaks [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5785.16s)]
*  and I vacuum seal them. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5787.16s)]
*  So what I do is I'll get the vac straps [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5789.16s)]
*  and I'll set up a cutting board and I slice them. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5791.16s)]
*  When I'm slicing into it, man, [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5793.16s)]
*  it's like red gold. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5795.16s)]
*  You know this slice of, and then I'm trimming [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5797.16s)]
*  all the silver skin around and I'm looking [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5799.16s)]
*  at that thing that's this meal that [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5801.16s)]
*  I just vacuum sealed. Now I'm going to freeze. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5803.16s)]
*  That is so valuable to me. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5805.16s)]
*  It's so delicious and so good [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5807.16s)]
*  for you. You wake up horny. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5809.16s)]
*  So when I eat like that, [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5811.16s)]
*  I do. But I like ribeyes [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5813.16s)]
*  too because ribeyes have a lot of fat. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5815.16s)]
*  And when you're eating only meat, you really want [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5817.16s)]
*  to get a lot of fat in there too, somehow [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5819.16s)]
*  or another. So for me it's like butter [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5821.16s)]
*  and eggs and bacon [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5823.16s)]
*  and whatever I can do to get [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5825.16s)]
*  fat or ribeyes. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5827.16s)]
*  So if it's gay meat, it's usually gay meat [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5829.16s)]
*  with something else that's going to provide me with some [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5831.16s)]
*  fats. I'll still eat avocados. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5833.16s)]
*  I'll still eat other things. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5835.16s)]
*  Why is some elk like super gay [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5837.16s)]
*  meat? [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5839.16s)]
*  100% how they took care of it. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5841.16s)]
*  Like right after they killed it? [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5843.16s)]
*  Yeah, unless the animal [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5845.16s)]
*  I shot an animal once [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5847.16s)]
*  and he had a [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5849.16s)]
*  large pus section [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5851.16s)]
*  in his hip. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5853.16s)]
*  So he had gotten stabbed by [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5855.16s)]
*  another elk. They kill each other all the [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5857.16s)]
*  time. Those antlers, [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5859.16s)]
*  that's what that's for. That's not for [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5861.16s)]
*  defense against wolves or anything like that. That is [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5863.16s)]
*  to kill each other. They just [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5865.16s)]
*  fucking smash, smash [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5867.16s)]
*  heads with these giant [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5869.16s)]
*  war antlers. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5871.16s)]
*  And they stab each other. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5873.16s)]
*  I've seen elk that have stab [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5875.16s)]
*  holes in their body. Cam Haynes [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5877.16s)]
*  snuck up on a bedded elk once. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5879.16s)]
*  He saw this bedded elk and he [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5881.16s)]
*  got within like 40 yards [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5883.16s)]
*  this bedded elk, drew back, [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5885.16s)]
*  placed a perfect arrow [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5887.16s)]
*  through its vitals and it didn't budge. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5889.16s)]
*  Didn't even move. So he went [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5891.16s)]
*  over to it and it was already dead. It had been [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5893.16s)]
*  killed by another bull. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5895.16s)]
*  It was like woah. All over pussy. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5897.16s)]
*  All over pussy. And then they become homies afterwards. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5899.16s)]
*  They're friends. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5901.16s)]
*  After they fight? Before and after. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5903.16s)]
*  They're friends for like 9, [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5905.16s)]
*  10 months and then some happens. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5907.16s)]
*  And they start [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5909.16s)]
*  Just mating season probably. Just fucking horny. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5911.16s)]
*  One gal gets into estrus [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5913.16s)]
*  She's looking good, walking away. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5915.16s)]
*  She's making noises, they make noises. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5917.16s)]
*  They go [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5919.16s)]
*  Have you ever called in an elk? [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5921.16s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5923.16s)]
*  He was calling a fucking elk in the hotel room. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5925.16s)]
*  And his travel bag, he was fucking calling it like [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5927.16s)]
*  2am in the hotel room last night. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5929.16s)]
*  Do you elk hunt? [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5931.16s)]
*  My brother and dad are like big hunters. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5933.16s)]
*  They live in Montana. Hunt everything. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5935.16s)]
*  They're big about it. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5937.16s)]
*  That's the Mecca. Yeah it is. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5939.16s)]
*  That's crazy. I grew up not even fucking [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5941.16s)]
*  couldn't even spell hunt. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5943.16s)]
*  I grew up in nothing. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5945.16s)]
*  We were talking about getting dialed in on a bow. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5947.16s)]
*  You shoot a bow sometimes. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5949.16s)]
*  I want to bring you to Cam Hanes' place. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5951.16s)]
*  Where is that? Here? It's in Oregon. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5953.16s)]
*  And he does this thing called lift run shoot. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5955.16s)]
*  So you lift with him, you run with him [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5957.16s)]
*  and he'll take you to the bow rack [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5959.16s)]
*  and film it for YouTube. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5961.16s)]
*  Take it to run 20 miles. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5963.16s)]
*  I think it's 13. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5965.16s)]
*  Oh actually? [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5967.16s)]

*  No, no, no, no, no. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5971.16s)]
*  I think he has you run up Mount Pigsca [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5973.16s)]
*  and then you [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5975.16s)]
*  or you can carry a rock. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5977.16s)]
*  It's like up to you. You can either run [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5979.16s)]
*  or you can carry this giant rock. I'd rather run. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5981.16s)]
*  I can fucking run. Actually that fight camp [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5983.16s)]
*  last fight camp was the first time I didn't [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5985.16s)]
*  wasn't running. No treadmill sprints. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5987.16s)]
*  I did some stairs just because they weren't too bad on my knees. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5989.16s)]
*  But, air dying though. Did a lot [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5991.16s)]
*  of fucking air dying just to get my [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5993.16s)]
*  air dying is the shit. Yeah it sucked. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5995.16s)]
*  It sucks a fat one but it is the shit [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5997.16s)]
*  when it comes to cardio. Our sprints we were doing [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=5999.16s)]
*  MMAs bar. We were doing fucking sprints [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6001.16s)]
*  on the air dying, hitting mitts, speed ladders [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6003.16s)]

*  fucking miserable. I woke up and just did not [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6007.16s)]
*  want to do it at all. Francis said that was [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6009.16s)]
*  his primary cardio for the [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6011.16s)]
*  serial gon fight because he fucked his knee up. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6013.16s)]
*  That was probably my primary cardio [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6015.16s)]
*  was the fucking thing. No other machine can [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6017.16s)]
*  gas you out more I don't think. In 30 seconds [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6019.16s)]

*  I love that thing. But I think if I had to pick [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6029.16s)]
*  one piece of cardio equipment it's [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6031.16s)]
*  the Rogue Echo Bike. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6033.16s)]
*  Their version of it. I think it's like super beefy [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6035.16s)]
*  and sturdy. And it also one of the things [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6037.16s)]
*  I like is it has like a... You can get a [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6039.16s)]
*  plastic lid that covers the fan in [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6041.16s)]
*  front of you so that it doesn't blow air at you. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6043.16s)]
*  So it doesn't cool you off. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6045.16s)]
*  Yeah that sucks sometimes. Yeah. You don't get [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6047.16s)]

*  sprints like tabata's but [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6095.16s)]
*  just steady state cardio. Where [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6097.16s)]
*  you're constantly at around 130 [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6099.16s)]
*  135 which is a lot of rolling. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6101.16s)]
*  Especially if you're technical rolling. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6103.16s)]

*  I don't know if it would be good. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6423.16s)]
*  I don't know if it would be good for anything. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6425.16s)]
*  I think that's good for like maybe goofing around on podcasts and deadlifting. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6427.16s)]
*  That's the fuck, how you sell it right there. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6433.16s)]

*  Brian Simpson hit it and it was so bad [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6439.16s)]
*  that he had to take his headphones off and he ran out of the room. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6441.16s)]
*  I think he broke those headphones too. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6443.16s)]

*  Probably, maybe. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6459.16s)]

*  We have this communal hang. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6465.16s)]

*  But you can say shit in the green room or at the house. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6483.16s)]
*  No phones, let it rip. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6487.16s)]

*  where one of your coworkers says I let her piss in my mouth. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6505.16s)]

*  A ton of up and coming comics. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6527.16s)]
*  Because we have two nights of open mic nights. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6529.16s)]
*  So two nights where the amateurs can practice. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6531.16s)]
*  We have door people showcases. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6533.16s)]

*  And they auditioned for that job with their act. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6539.16s)]

*  He's a young dude. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6547.16s)]
*  His uncle too. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6549.16s)]
*  He's got real talent. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6551.16s)]

*  It's just a time thing. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6555.16s)]
*  And he moved out here too. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6557.16s)]
*  Just came out here from Florida. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6559.16s)]
*  I remember watching that episode when he got... [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6561.16s)]
*  The first time he came on. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6563.16s)]
*  It's so cool to see how just like... [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6565.16s)]
*  Killing it in that one minute can fucking change your life. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6567.16s)]
*  It's so cool to see. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6569.16s)]
*  Oh, it changes everything. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6571.16s)]
*  That show has launched so many careers. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6573.16s)]
*  And it's a great [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6575.16s)]
*  bedrock for the comedy [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6577.16s)]
*  scene here in Austin. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6579.16s)]
*  Because it teaches you to just be funny. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6581.16s)]
*  It's not about [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6583.16s)]
*  whatever woke cultural [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6585.16s)]
*  trends and espousing all the [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6587.16s)]
*  right virtues on stage, which you do fucking see [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6589.16s)]
*  at some of these places. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6591.16s)]
*  Yeah, because they're young kids. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6593.16s)]
*  And they think they have to be woke. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6595.16s)]
*  And they see certain people on Netflix. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6597.16s)]
*  And they see them getting critical [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6599.16s)]
*  reviews. So they try to ape that. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6601.16s)]
*  They try to mimic that. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6603.16s)]
*  Pretend they're that. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6605.16s)]
*  And they just get caught in this world [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6607.16s)]
*  of virtue signaling instead of the world of [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6609.16s)]
*  just trying to be funny. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6611.16s)]
*  And on Kill Tony, you're just trying to be funny. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6613.16s)]
*  Everyone's just trying to be funny. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6615.16s)]

*  And it's just a great experience. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6643.16s)]
*  It was obliterated. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6645.16s)]
*  They said they went drinking with him on Sunday. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6647.16s)]
*  And he said, it's like a movie. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6649.16s)]
*  He's like, let's go meet some girls. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6651.16s)]
*  He's doing Long Island Ice Teas. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6653.16s)]
*  He's doing Long Island Ice Teas. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6655.16s)]
*  Just getting hammered. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6657.16s)]
*  His ears were incredibly long. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6659.16s)]
*  That's what happens with old people. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6661.16s)]
*  Your nose grows and your ears grow forever. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6663.16s)]
*  Your ears and your nose keep growing. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6665.16s)]
*  Could that be from human growth hormones? [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6667.16s)]
*  I don't think it's just an age thing. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6669.16s)]
*  I think all old people have giant ears. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6671.16s)]
*  I think all old people have giant ears. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6673.16s)]
*  I used to see really old people. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6675.16s)]
*  So if you are young and you have little ears, [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6677.16s)]
*  these ears suck. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6679.16s)]
*  Hang in there. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6681.16s)]
*  You'll love those when you're 80. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6683.16s)]
*  Because you're going to have a normal face [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6685.16s)]
*  instead of looking like fucking Dumbo. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6687.16s)]
*  Some old people have crazy big ears. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6689.16s)]
*  Some old people have crazy big ears. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6691.16s)]

*  like Elon and all those things, [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6695.16s)]
*  do you do anything special in the morning [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6697.16s)]
*  or just a normal morning? [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6699.16s)]
*  Normal. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6701.16s)]
*  I don't want to be hungover. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6703.16s)]
*  That's awesome. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6705.16s)]
*  Especially an Elon one or a scientist one. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6707.16s)]
*  Depending upon the subject, [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6709.16s)]
*  if it's a scientist, [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6711.16s)]
*  often times I'll read their book [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6713.16s)]
*  or I'll listen to it [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6715.16s)]
*  or I'll watch lectures that they've given [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6717.16s)]
*  or TED Talks. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6719.16s)]
*  Just try to get a sense of [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6721.16s)]
*  what I'm curious about. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6723.16s)]
*  About whatever the subject is. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6725.16s)]
*  Fuck you do it. Those guys are just so smart. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6727.16s)]
*  You do a good job at just not letting your mind [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6729.16s)]
*  water and focus on what they're saying. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6731.16s)]
*  That's a fucking skill. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6733.16s)]
*  It's really because the only reason [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6735.16s)]
*  they're there is because I'm actually interested in the subject. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6737.16s)]
*  I don't have to fake it. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6739.16s)]
*  It's not even really a skill. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6741.16s)]
*  It's just my honest curiosity. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6743.16s)]
*  When I'm talking to a guy like Brian Keating [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6745.16s)]
*  or astrophysicist guys, [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6747.16s)]
*  these guys are so goddamn smart [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6749.16s)]
*  that really [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6751.16s)]
*  all I'm trying to do [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6753.16s)]
*  is just get a grasp [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6755.16s)]
*  of how this is understood. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6757.16s)]
*  What are they doing to figure this out? [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6759.16s)]
*  Is it possible that they're going to [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6761.16s)]
*  know in the future that this data is incorrect? [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6763.16s)]
*  What other factors could be... [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6765.16s)]
*  They're talking about the age of the universe. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6767.16s)]
*  There's some debate now [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6769.16s)]
*  that the age of the universe is probably [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6771.16s)]
*  not really 13.7 billion years [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6773.16s)]
*  but maybe even 26 billion or more. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6775.16s)]
*  Talking to him about that [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6777.16s)]
*  I was like, how are you figuring this out? [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6779.16s)]
*  Just to talk to those people, [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6781.16s)]
*  it's so interesting. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6783.16s)]
*  Just to be able to have these kind of conversations [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6785.16s)]
*  with those type of people. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6787.16s)]
*  Have you always been curious like that your whole life? [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6789.16s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6791.16s)]
*  About the things I'm curious in. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6793.16s)]
*  But I was terrible in school. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6795.16s)]
*  Like in school I was terrible. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6797.16s)]
*  I just did not want to be there. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6799.16s)]
*  I thought they were just preparing me [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6801.16s)]
*  for a job that I didn't want. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6803.16s)]
*  And I didn't want to be a part... [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6805.16s)]
*  And I looked at them and I was like, [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6807.16s)]
*  I don't want to be you. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6809.16s)]
*  Like, what is this life you're living? [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6811.16s)]
*  You don't have any joy. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6813.16s)]
*  You don't have fun. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6815.16s)]
*  You're all rigid and you look depressed. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6817.16s)]
*  Like, get me out of here. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6819.16s)]
*  When I was in school I was like, get me out of here. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6821.16s)]
*  After I graduated from high school [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6823.16s)]
*  I used to have nightmares that I didn't graduate [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6825.16s)]
*  and had to go back. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6827.16s)]
*  That's funny. I knew I didn't want to go to... [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6829.16s)]
*  I was in elementary school and I was like, [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6831.16s)]
*  no chance I'm going to college. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6833.16s)]
*  Oh shit, I think we have that letter. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6835.16s)]
*  You weren't getting any pressure from your parents [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6837.16s)]
*  or anything about college? [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6839.16s)]
*  But still you said no fucking way. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6841.16s)]
*  Well, I took a year... I was telling everybody [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6843.16s)]
*  I'm taking a year off. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6845.16s)]
*  But it's like, I was really... [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6847.16s)]
*  All I wanted to do was compete back then [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6849.16s)]
*  but there was zero money in Taekwondo. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6851.16s)]
*  I wanted to make it into the Olympics. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6853.16s)]
*  But then when I was [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6855.16s)]
*  training, one of the things that I noticed [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6857.16s)]
*  is, first of all, [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6859.16s)]
*  I always had my doubts [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6861.16s)]
*  that's the best style. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6863.16s)]
*  But then when I started kickboxing, [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6865.16s)]
*  I was starting to get lit up by kickboxers. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6867.16s)]
*  I was like, oh my god, there's so many holes [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6869.16s)]
*  in this. And I don't want to [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6871.16s)]
*  compete in this thing that's so [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6873.16s)]
*  limited. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6875.16s)]
*  That punches too. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6877.16s)]
*  Muay Thai was next. Kickboxing, American [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6879.16s)]
*  kickboxing was first. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6881.16s)]
*  It was above the way stuff. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6883.16s)]
*  When you got trapped in a corner and my [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6885.16s)]
*  hands sucked, I just sucked at [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6887.16s)]
*  boxing. I was really good at kicking [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6889.16s)]
*  people. They were on the outside. I was [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6891.16s)]
*  amazed at how bad their kicks were. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6893.16s)]
*  Like most of the kickboxers I trained with, [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6895.16s)]
*  I just fucked them up from the outside. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6897.16s)]
*  Loading up. Yeah, they were loading up. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6899.16s)]
*  Their technique sucked. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6901.16s)]
*  Their knees were down. They're kicking up. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6903.16s)]
*  Everything's telegraphed. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6905.16s)]
*  The kicks were just a part of brawling. [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6907.16s)]
*  They just threw it in there. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6909.16s)]
*  But if I could get out of the way, [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6911.16s)]
*  moving on the outside, I could close the [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6913.16s)]
*  distance so much faster than they could. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6915.16s)]
*  But then in kickboxing, when I was [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6917.16s)]
*  getting boxed, I was like, oh my god, I have [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6919.16s)]
*  giant holes in my game. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6921.16s)]
*  So it made me really not [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6923.16s)]
*  enjoy taekwondo anymore. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6925.16s)]
*  So I stopped competing in taekwondo and I [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6927.16s)]
*  started kickboxing. And then I started [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6929.16s)]
*  getting headaches because we weren't sparring. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6931.16s)]
*  We were fighting. One of my main [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6933.16s)]
*  sparring partners was this dude that had just [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6935.16s)]
*  got out of jail. I knew him when I was [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6937.16s)]
*  16. He was kind of crazy [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6939.16s)]
*  then, but then he went to jail for [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6941.16s)]
*  something to do with drugs. And then he came [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6943.16s)]
*  out three years later [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6945.16s)]
*  when I was 19 and he was a totally [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6947.16s)]
*  different person. He was super [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6949.16s)]
*  jacked. I don't know if they got him steroids in [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6951.16s)]
*  jail or whatever. He had to sand it off [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6953.16s)]
*  all of his tattoos. He used to have these [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6955.16s)]
*  really shitty tattoos and he had [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6957.16s)]
*  like literally burned them off. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6959.16s)]
*  So all of his arm was covered [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6961.16s)]
*  with these like keloid scars. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6963.16s)]
*  And when me and that guy would spar, [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6965.16s)]
*  it was a fight to the death. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6967.16s)]
*  He would just be chasing me [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6969.16s)]
*  down. We'd be blasting each other. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6971.16s)]
*  And I remember one time lying in [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6973.16s)]
*  my bed, broke, [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6975.16s)]
*  20 years old, no money, [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6977.16s)]
*  no future. And you know, I had been offered [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6979.16s)]
*  a pro fight for like $400 or $500 [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6981.16s)]
*  or something like that. MMA? [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6983.16s)]
*  No, kickboxing. There was no MMA at the time. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6985.16s)]
*  This was 1988. And I remember thinking, [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6987.16s)]
*  what am I doing? Like what am I [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6989.16s)]
*  doing with my life? [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6991.16s)]
*  You know. $500? And there was just [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6993.16s)]
*  no future in it. There was just nowhere [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6995.16s)]
*  to go. Like so you're getting good at [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6997.16s)]
*  this thing that there's nothing there. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=6999.16s)]
*  There's nowhere to go with it. Like you could become [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7001.16s)]
*  a boxer, but you're not good at boxing. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7003.16s)]
*  So what are you going to do? You're going to just get beat up? [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7005.16s)]
*  You're going to get brain damage? And then I got a chance [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7007.16s)]
*  to see some of the guys that I was training with start [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7009.16s)]
*  to exhibit signs of brain damage. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7011.16s)]
*  And that's where it gets weird. [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7013.16s)]
*  That'll open your eyes up a bit. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7015.16s)]
*  You've been still doing [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7017.16s)]
*  your Invisalign? Yeah, I took it off today. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7019.16s)]
*  You guys got them on too? [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7021.16s)]
*  I wore mine for about a year and a half. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7023.16s)]
*  I cannot believe [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7025.16s)]
*  what, because I didn't realize how fucked up [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7027.16s)]
*  my teeth were. And then someone pointed [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7029.16s)]
*  it out and I was like, [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7031.16s)]
*  damn, I fucked up. And then I got Invisalign [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7033.16s)]
*  after you did. And I'll be smiling [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7035.16s)]
*  all day now. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7037.16s)]
*  They weren't good as a mouthpiece too. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7039.16s)]
*  I don't mind. I kind of crave them being in [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7041.16s)]
*  sometimes. It's a better mouthpiece for [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7043.16s)]
*  Jiu Jitsu. Yeah. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7045.16s)]
*  It's probably not good enough for striking, but for [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7047.16s)]
*  Jiu Jitsu it's a better mouthpiece. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7049.16s)]
*  I remember it was a pain in the ass though. Some nights [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7051.16s)]
*  you're just like, oh, I don't want to [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7053.16s)]
*  wear these. Or you change your trays and just like [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7055.16s)]
*  fuck. [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7057.16s)]
*  The timing of everything though [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7059.16s)]
*  with your career and just social media [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7061.16s)]
*  and all this stuff just blowing up. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7063.16s)]
*  It's just so weird how everything [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7065.16s)]
*  worked out. It's just like a lot of luck, but [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7067.16s)]
*  a lot of being prepared for the luck. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7069.16s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. Yeah. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7071.16s)]
*  It's almost like fate. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7073.16s)]
*  I mean, if you wanted to really believe in fate, [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7075.16s)]
*  if you look at the story that you guys have, [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7077.16s)]
*  it's kind of fucking weird. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7079.16s)]
*  It kind of seems like it's fate. I know. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7081.16s)]
*  It's hard to say because [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7083.16s)]
*  then what about people that don't make it? Is that [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7085.16s)]
*  fate too? Or is it like, could they have made [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7087.16s)]
*  it if they were more disciplined and more driven [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7089.16s)]
*  and more this, more that? And they found the right [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7091.16s)]
*  coaches and they got to the right gym? And could they have? [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7093.16s)]
*  I don't know. A lot of people [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7095.16s)]
*  just don't make the decisions and don't do [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7097.16s)]
*  what you [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7099.16s)]
*  need to do. And a lot of that is necessarily [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7101.16s)]
*  just like, isn't hard stuff, [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7103.16s)]
*  but it's like, I'm going to go home. [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7105.16s)]
*  I'm going to ice bath. I'm going to sauna. [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7107.16s)]
*  I'm going to stretch. And I'm going to go to bed. Instead of going [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7109.16s)]
*  out with the boys. And I'm going to do that for [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7111.16s)]
*  fucking nine years until I'm world champ. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7113.16s)]
*  That was a lot of it. I know a lot [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7115.16s)]
*  of guys are so fucking good, [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7117.16s)]
*  but it's Friday. I'm going to go out, hang out, [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7119.16s)]
*  drink, stay up late. Coming up, [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7121.16s)]
*  we didn't do that ever. Like right now, [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7123.16s)]
*  obviously coming off the fight, [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7125.16s)]
*  I've been traveling a lot over the weekends, [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7127.16s)]
*  but for the most part, [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7129.16s)]
*  even still, once we get back to [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7131.16s)]
*  routine, it's like just doing those [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7133.16s)]
*  little things. Stretching, taking care of your [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7135.16s)]
*  body, eating clean, and just [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7137.16s)]
*  fucking preparing for the next day, preparing [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7139.16s)]
*  for the next training sessions for years [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7141.16s)]
*  of consistency. That's what [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7143.16s)]
*  it's all about. It's all about having [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7145.16s)]
*  a goal and building towards that goal and [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7147.16s)]
*  doing everything that you can to be as great [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7149.16s)]
*  as you can be. And now that you've done it, [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7151.16s)]
*  you've also laid a foundation [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7153.16s)]
*  and a groundwork. You've led [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7155.16s)]
*  these young [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7157.16s)]
*  fighters who see [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7159.16s)]
*  what you've done and they can see that there's [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7161.16s)]
*  like a path. And that like [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7163.16s)]
*  I'm going to emulate this guy's [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7165.16s)]
*  focus, this guy's discipline, this guy's belief [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7167.16s)]
*  in himself. And you know, [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7169.16s)]
*  that is what inspires so many [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7171.16s)]
*  other people to do it. I remember [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7173.16s)]
*  being a kid watching [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7175.16s)]
*  the training sessions of Mike Tyson with Custom Auto [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7177.16s)]
*  and just thinking like [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7179.16s)]
*  wow, what an amazing [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7181.16s)]
*  convergence [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7183.16s)]
*  of these two human beings. [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7185.16s)]
*  It comes together, this guy's fully [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7187.16s)]
*  disciplined, fully focused, [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7189.16s)]
*  and then when he wins the world title [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7191.16s)]
*  at 20 years old, you see him standing there [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7193.16s)]
*  inside the ring [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7195.16s)]
*  after he knocked out Trevor [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7197.16s)]
*  Burbank and you're like holy shit, he did it. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7199.16s)]
*  He fucking did it. He did [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7201.16s)]
*  everything he had to do. He [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7203.16s)]
*  fucking went full bore [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7205.16s)]
*  with talent and drive [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7207.16s)]
*  and genetics and coaching [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7209.16s)]
*  and all the boxes checked. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7211.16s)]
*  Everything checked and look what you get. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7213.16s)]
*  Look what you get. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7215.16s)]
*  Yeah. And how many [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7217.16s)]
*  people did that guy inspire? He [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7219.16s)]
*  certainly inspired me, he certainly inspired [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7221.16s)]
*  thousands, millions of other guys [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7223.16s)]
*  to do things. Especially Sean [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7225.16s)]
*  being like a skinnier kid. Well [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7227.16s)]
*  I think [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7229.16s)]
*  I think too [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7231.16s)]
*  I think I'm gonna piss too. Let's [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7233.16s)]
*  pause, we'll pause [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7235.16s)]
*  and we're back. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7237.16s)]
*  We are. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7239.16s)]
*  Want one of these kill clips? I'm good for now, I'm good [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7241.16s)]
*  thank you. I'm still geeking [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7243.16s)]
*  off this caffeine a little bit right here. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7245.16s)]
*  Let's fucking move. Dude, literally, I mean [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7247.16s)]
*  the art of podcasting is a crazy [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7249.16s)]
*  fucking thing. When you have three, five [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7251.16s)]
*  hour conversations it's so next level. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7253.16s)]
*  Yeah, I sometimes have five a week. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7255.16s)]
*  Holy fuck. Sometimes, some weeks [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7257.16s)]
*  I have them every day. Yeah, [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7259.16s)]
*  that's a lot. That's fucking impressive. And it's like one [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7261.16s)]
*  day I'll be talking to Eddie Bravo and we'll just be fucking [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7263.16s)]
*  around talking shit. And the next day [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7265.16s)]
*  I'll be talking to some super scientist. Yeah, that's [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7267.16s)]
*  wild. Balance. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7269.16s)]
*  Mathematicians and geniuses and [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7271.16s)]
*  psychologists. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7273.16s)]
*  It's weird. Do you usually think it at like two [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7275.16s)]
*  weeks ahead or a week ahead or is it just coming [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7277.16s)]
*  and you message them or how does that go? [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7279.16s)]
*  It's pretty far in advance. Most of the time [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7281.16s)]
*  it's booked and it's all [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7283.16s)]
*  booked on my interests. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7285.16s)]
*  It's 100% on what I'm interested in. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7287.16s)]
*  That's cool. All I do [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7289.16s)]
*  is look at the potentials [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7291.16s)]
*  like who... [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7293.16s)]
*  Sometimes I reach out to people. I reach out to this guy [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7295.16s)]
*  yesterday who wrote this book on the American [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7297.16s)]
*  West and I reached out [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7299.16s)]
*  to him because I had heard him on another podcast and I [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7301.16s)]
*  got his book. And sometimes it's just [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7303.16s)]
*  they'll send the email in and it [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7305.16s)]
*  goes through my guy and it gets filtered back to me [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7307.16s)]
*  and he sends the ones that are relevant [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7309.16s)]
*  and I look at those and I'm like hmmm. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7311.16s)]
*  I just look what interests me. This [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7313.16s)]
*  one, nah, nah. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7315.16s)]
*  Boring, boring. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7317.16s)]
*  What's he doing? Okay. [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7319.16s)]
*  And then I'll go see if I can find a YouTube video [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7321.16s)]
*  of them talking. Because I've had writers on before [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7323.16s)]
*  and they can't talk. And that's kind of [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7325.16s)]
*  a bummer. Like maybe they talk the way they [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7327.16s)]
*  write. So they go well [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7329.16s)]
*  so. And [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7333.16s)]
*  I think... And you're like oh no. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7335.16s)]
*  This one sucks. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7337.16s)]
*  I should have listened to this [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7339.16s)]
*  guy talk first. Sometimes the [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7341.16s)]
*  ideas are great but the people aren't compelling. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7343.16s)]
*  Do you ever have a smoke and then read a book? [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7345.16s)]
*  Oh yeah, sure. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7347.16s)]
*  I like doing that. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7349.16s)]
*  I like books in the sauna. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7351.16s)]
*  Like audios? [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7353.16s)]
*  You're just sweating all over your pages. [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7355.16s)]
*  Yeah, audio books [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7357.16s)]
*  in the sauna are my favorite way to consume [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7359.16s)]
*  them. Because you know you're going to [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7361.16s)]
*  be in that sauna anyway. I've been listening to Marcus [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7363.16s)]
*  Aurelius' meditations in the [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7365.16s)]
*  sauna recently. That's [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7367.16s)]
*  amazing. You listen to this dude that [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7369.16s)]
*  lived 2000 fucking years ago [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7371.16s)]
*  and he's just spitting knowledge. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7373.16s)]
*  I like Ryan Holiday. He [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7375.16s)]
*  kind of breaks down what he says. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7377.16s)]
*  The Daily Stoics, [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7379.16s)]
*  the 365 days. I've had that [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7381.16s)]
*  book for like four years and I still [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7383.16s)]
*  religiously, especially in camp [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7385.16s)]
*  for like 12 weeks out, read every morning [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7387.16s)]
*  and just like fucking [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7389.16s)]
*  it's good. It's good shit. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7391.16s)]
*  Ryan Holiday is awesome. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7393.16s)]
*  It's so cool when there's people that like highlight [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7395.16s)]
*  stuff like that and really put [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7397.16s)]
*  it out there and just get so many people [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7399.16s)]
*  interested in those ideas. But [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7401.16s)]
*  Marcus Aurelius is like listening to his stuff. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7403.16s)]
*  I was always like, oh [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7405.16s)]
*  this guy is so interesting. Like God, [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7407.16s)]
*  imagine being like this [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7409.16s)]
*  conqueror, this guy who's like [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7411.16s)]
*  running Rome and [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7413.16s)]
*  running Greece and you think like this. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7415.16s)]
*  Yeah, that's wild shit. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7417.16s)]
*  How does he think like that? Why is [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7419.16s)]
*  his mind [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7421.16s)]
*  like, how's a, Aurelius [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7423.16s)]
*  is a Roman Emperor, right? [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7425.16s)]
*  I wonder if, yeah, I wonder if it'd be good [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7427.16s)]
*  for like Stoicism to be taught in schools [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7429.16s)]
*  at whatever age or something. [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7431.16s)]
*  Sure. Teaching you how to think is one of the [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7433.16s)]
*  main things that's missing from school. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7435.16s)]
*  That's crazy. Like teaching you how to manage your mind [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7437.16s)]
*  is how many times like can someone [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7439.16s)]
*  say one thing to you [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7441.16s)]
*  and that thing kind of resets the way you [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7443.16s)]
*  look at stuff. Like, oh yeah, [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7445.16s)]
*  now I'll apply this. And you can apply it in real [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7447.16s)]
*  world. It's like a tool that you can use. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7449.16s)]
*  You know, you could try to twist [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7451.16s)]
*  something with your fingers, but if you have a wrench [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7453.16s)]
*  like, oh yeah, this is way better. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7455.16s)]
*  And sometimes ideas are like a tool [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7457.16s)]
*  and you can just apply them [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7459.16s)]
*  at various times in your life. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7461.16s)]
*  And if you can hear about them from someone who's [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7463.16s)]
*  already figured that out, that's a giant [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7465.16s)]
*  step in the learning curve [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7467.16s)]
*  that you get to jump. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7469.16s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, like even if it was Naval, [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7471.16s)]
*  some of his stuff is so fucking [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7473.16s)]
*  good. Naval is fucking fun to listen to. [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7475.16s)]
*  His Twitter's good. Yeah. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7477.16s)]
*  Yeah, Naval is good. Do you, like, did you, [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7479.16s)]
*  how did you decide what school your kids are going to [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7481.16s)]
*  go to? [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7483.16s)]
*  You know, there's good schools out here. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7485.16s)]
*  We're lucky. We're in Mouse. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7487.16s)]
*  California is much more [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7489.16s)]
*  problematic right now for schools. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7491.16s)]
*  Because one of the things that was happening to me [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7493.16s)]
*  in my school [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7495.16s)]
*  where my kids used to go, is they [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7497.16s)]
*  hired some person to [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7499.16s)]
*  teach them that [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7501.16s)]
*  they have to be anti-racists. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7503.16s)]
*  It's not good enough to not [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7505.16s)]
*  be racist. What the fuck? [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7507.16s)]
*  Like, my kids aren't racist at all. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7509.16s)]
*  Like, what are you doing? Like, why are you putting that [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7511.16s)]
*  in their head? That they have to be anti-racist [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7513.16s)]
*  and call out racism? And like, [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7515.16s)]
*  they're trying to make kids activists. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7517.16s)]
*  I'm like, hey, they're five. [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7519.16s)]
*  That's crazy. You know, like, they don't [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7521.16s)]
*  even care. They want, they want friends. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7523.16s)]
*  They don't give a fuck what their friends look like. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7525.16s)]
*  They're trying to have a good time. They're five. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7527.16s)]
*  They're just playing. Like, you're [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7529.16s)]
*  pumping in, you're indoctrinating [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7531.16s)]
*  them into this woke [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7533.16s)]
*  guilt-free or guilt-ridden [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7535.16s)]
*  ideology that you're carrying around with you. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7537.16s)]
*  And you feel like you have an obligation [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7539.16s)]
*  to impose this on children. [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7541.16s)]
*  You know, our goals [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7543.16s)]
*  should have always been what the goals were that [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7545.16s)]
*  the liberals had in like the 60s and the 70s, [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7547.16s)]
*  which is a colorblind society. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7549.16s)]
*  The Martin Luther King notion [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7551.16s)]
*  that we should treat people by the content of their [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7553.16s)]
*  character, not the color of their skin. [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7555.16s)]
*  But across the board. And the [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7557.16s)]
*  problem is there's inequities in [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7559.16s)]
*  communities. There's inequities in [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7561.16s)]
*  how people grow up and where they come from. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7563.16s)]
*  And some people are in places that [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7565.16s)]
*  have no hope. And none of that gets addressed. [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7567.16s)]
*  None of that gets fixed. None of that gets [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7569.16s)]
*  worked on. Instead, [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7571.16s)]
*  you just try to make kids feel guilty. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7573.16s)]
*  It's like, [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7575.16s)]
*  I didn't like the woke shit. [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7577.16s)]
*  I didn't like that they were, you know, [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7579.16s)]
*  trying to ask kids their [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7581.16s)]
*  pronouns. And... [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7583.16s)]
*  How did you find out that they were doing that? [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7585.16s)]
*  We got an email. It was an email [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7587.16s)]
*  from... Anti-racist email? [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7589.16s)]
*  Yeah, it was like right around the George Floyd time. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7591.16s)]
*  I was like, oh my god. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7593.16s)]
*  Because some people, what happens is, [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7595.16s)]
*  they'll cap... There's a social movement. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7597.16s)]
*  And they hop on that [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7599.16s)]
*  social movement to [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7601.16s)]
*  enhance their own career. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7603.16s)]
*  And they use it to optimize their own... [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7605.16s)]
*  You know, it's this thing that... [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7607.16s)]
*  It's what you would call a race hustler. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7609.16s)]
*  You know, there's people that do stuff like that. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7611.16s)]
*  Or it cannot be that. It could be [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7613.16s)]
*  any kind of social issue. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7615.16s)]
*  You want that social issue to be a [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7617.16s)]
*  bigger deal than it is. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7619.16s)]
*  You're attached to that. It could be climate [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7621.16s)]
*  change. It could be whatever the fuck [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7623.16s)]
*  it is. It could be the... You know, you see Sean Penn [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7625.16s)]
*  doing all these interviews about the war in Ukraine. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7627.16s)]
*  Like, what is actually going on there? [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7629.16s)]
*  Part of it is you're attaching [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7631.16s)]
*  yourself to something that makes you look virtuous. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7633.16s)]
*  And it also [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7635.16s)]
*  enhances your career. So it's like a thing you're [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7637.16s)]
*  doing. It's very rare that when [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7639.16s)]
*  people are like... [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7641.16s)]
*  Prostitizing and out there trying to [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7643.16s)]
*  indoctrinate people into certain [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7645.16s)]
*  ideas. It's very rare they're doing [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7647.16s)]
*  it just for true altruism. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7649.16s)]
*  Like, they think that those ideas are just [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7651.16s)]
*  immensely beneficial. They're also [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7653.16s)]
*  doing it to boost themselves up. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7655.16s)]
*  And it becomes an economy. An economy [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7657.16s)]
*  of people that boost themselves up by [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7659.16s)]
*  highlighting valid [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7661.16s)]
*  issues in the world. [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7663.16s)]
*  But doing so in a way where they become [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7665.16s)]
*  the moral compass and the person who gets to [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7667.16s)]
*  dictate how people behave and think [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7669.16s)]
*  and talk. They build their little niche. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7671.16s)]
*  It's just control, Matt. People [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7673.16s)]
*  love to fucking control people. [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7675.16s)]
*  And if they can control people because there's [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7677.16s)]
*  some guilt thing and a social... [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7679.16s)]
*  A horrible social issue. [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7681.16s)]
*  Like the George Floyd thing. [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7683.16s)]
*  Where everybody's kind of on board. Like, oh my god, they killed that guy. [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7685.16s)]
*  This is horrible. Watching that. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7687.16s)]
*  What kind of police brutality and racism [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7689.16s)]
*  and all these different things. And then someone [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7691.16s)]
*  says, I know what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna ride [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7693.16s)]
*  this fucking wave and I'm gonna get a job in schools. [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7695.16s)]
*  And I'm gonna start indoctrinating people. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7697.16s)]
*  They wanted to firing that person. [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7699.16s)]
*  That person was going ham. [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7701.16s)]
*  But, you know, the whole school [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7703.16s)]
*  was like... It shifted. [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7705.16s)]
*  It shifted with the social tide. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7707.16s)]
*  And I was like, you're not supposed to be [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7709.16s)]
*  doing that to kids. You're supposed to be teaching kids. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7711.16s)]
*  That's just teaching them life. [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7713.16s)]
*  I don't like you. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7715.16s)]
*  So I don't want you putting your [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7717.16s)]
*  shitty philosophy, your shitty [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7719.16s)]
*  judgmental philosophy, and indoctrinating [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7721.16s)]
*  children with it. Because I think you're [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7723.16s)]
*  a moron. You're a moron who just [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7725.16s)]
*  happens to have a job at a good school teaching [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7727.16s)]
*  kids. But I think if I sat you down in a podcast, [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7729.16s)]
*  you'd look pretty fucking stupid after a couple [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7731.16s)]
*  hours. [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7733.16s)]
*  You know? There's a lot of these people that don't get their ideas [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7735.16s)]
*  challenged. [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7737.16s)]
*  And now they're teaching [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7739.16s)]
*  eight-year-olds. You know? Like, Jesus Christ. [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7741.16s)]
*  That's fucking scary. [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7743.16s)]
*  And not just teaching them how to read. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7745.16s)]
*  How do you know you're a boy, Billy? [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7747.16s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7749.16s)]
*  You seem pretty feminine. [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7751.16s)]
*  Did you ever pick a doll when you should have [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7753.16s)]
*  picked a truck? Do you like pink? [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7755.16s)]
*  No. [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7757.16s)]
*  Do you monitor [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7759.16s)]
*  your kids on TikTok? How much they're on it? [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7761.16s)]
*  Yeah, we monitor them. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7763.16s)]
*  They can't have their phones at night. [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7765.16s)]
*  That's great. That's smart. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7767.16s)]
*  But I don't stop them from doing anything. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7769.16s)]
*  I don't stop them from eating junk food. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7771.16s)]
*  I don't stop them from [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7773.16s)]
*  playing on their computers. I don't stop them [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7775.16s)]
*  from playing with their phone. But I [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7777.16s)]
*  do emphasize the value of discipline. [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7779.16s)]
*  And they obviously see that [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7781.16s)]
*  I work hard. And my wife [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7783.16s)]
*  works hard. And we just talk to them about stuff. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7785.16s)]
*  I think if you deny kids social media, [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7787.16s)]
*  one of the things you're going to do is you're going to [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7789.16s)]
*  kind of socially alienate them. [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7791.16s)]
*  Because all their friends are on social media. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7793.16s)]
*  But then there's also this thing where [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7795.16s)]
*  kids are [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7797.16s)]
*  living in a new world. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7799.16s)]
*  And even though you didn't grow up in that world, [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7801.16s)]
*  if you say, oh, this social media [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7803.16s)]
*  I think they're getting an adversity [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7805.16s)]
*  that you're not going to get. And they're going to [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7807.16s)]
*  get some resilience from that adversity. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7809.16s)]
*  But there's going to be mental health consequences. [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7811.16s)]
*  And especially for people who didn't grow [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7813.16s)]
*  up in it. And that's one of the things that they experience. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7815.16s)]
*  Jonathan Haidt's book, [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7817.16s)]
*  The Coddling of the American Mind, [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7819.16s)]
*  is about that. And one of the things that highlights [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7821.16s)]
*  is self-harm amongst girls [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7823.16s)]
*  ramps up considerably. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7825.16s)]
*  Somewhere around 2008, [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7827.16s)]
*  2009. And it's right when [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7829.16s)]
*  Twitter and social media and Facebook [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7831.16s)]
*  and all that stuff comes out. And now they're [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7833.16s)]
*  comparing themselves to other people. [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7835.16s)]
*  Comparing lives. And people are using [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7837.16s)]
*  filters. And distorting reality. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7839.16s)]
*  And people [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7841.16s)]
*  there's more instances of suicide [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7843.16s)]
*  and self-harm. And then there's bullying. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7845.16s)]
*  There's a lot of bullying. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7847.16s)]
*  I think just being on my phone, I don't feel like I'm comparing myself. [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7849.16s)]
*  But just picking up my phone [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7851.16s)]
*  and being on it and surfing. And then putting it down. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7853.16s)]
*  And then picking it up surfing. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7855.16s)]
*  Just gives you this little level of anxiety. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7857.16s)]
*  It's just like, fuck! [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7859.16s)]
*  Some of the 4 and 5 year olds [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7861.16s)]
*  you can tell the ones that like [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7863.16s)]
*  in Jiu Jitsu, the ones that their [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7865.16s)]
*  parents really monitor it compared to the ones that always [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7867.16s)]
*  just put it in front of them. And a lot of those kids that [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7869.16s)]
*  always get it, they always quit Jiu Jitsu. [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7871.16s)]
*  Because it's too hard. Or they don't want to do the warmups. [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7873.16s)]
*  And they sit on the side now [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7875.16s)]
*  and just go sook, sook, sook. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7877.16s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7879.16s)]
*  It's so wasteful. It's so bad for you. [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7881.16s)]
*  It's just so dumb. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7883.16s)]
*  And I talk about it, but then I did it the other night. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7885.16s)]
*  The other night I was going to go to bed. It was 10.30. [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7887.16s)]
*  And I said, I'm going to go upstairs [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7889.16s)]
*  and see what's going on online. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7891.16s)]
*  And so I got online. I started watching [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7893.16s)]
*  YouTube videos. So easy. [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7895.16s)]
*  Then I went down a rabbit hole with the UFO [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7897.16s)]
*  disclosure. And then [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7899.16s)]
*  it's like 3 hours later. I'm like, what am I doing? [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7901.16s)]
*  Go to bed. That UFO. The smelling salt. [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7903.16s)]
*  The Rasinho or whatever. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7905.16s)]
*  That one, the documentary. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7907.16s)]
*  I heard you talk about it. Virginia, Virginia, Brazil. [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7909.16s)]
*  Moment of contact. It's crazy. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7911.16s)]
*  Because you're just like, either these guys are such good actors [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7913.16s)]
*  or they're a little bit crazy. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7915.16s)]
*  Or they're fucking just telling the truth. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7917.16s)]
*  It's so hard to know about that [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7919.16s)]
*  one cop. When they bring [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7921.16s)]
*  that one cop to the site where the crash was [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7923.16s)]
*  and he starts crying. Yeah. That's powerful. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7925.16s)]
*  I was like, fuck. I just [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7927.16s)]
*  don't believe that that guy could be that good of an actor. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7929.16s)]
*  I mean, that's a Daniel Day-Lewis performance. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7931.16s)]
*  That guy was killing it. [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7933.16s)]
*  If he's really acting like, bro, [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7935.16s)]
*  that was amazing. [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7937.16s)]
*  There are people that are like [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7939.16s)]
*  that. That are completely insane. [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7941.16s)]
*  How many people have lied [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7943.16s)]
*  about being attacked? [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7945.16s)]
*  Like, Jesse Smollett style. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7947.16s)]
*  How many people have lied about things that have happened [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7949.16s)]
*  to them when nothing happened to them? [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7951.16s)]
*  There's people that know that there's a value. [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7953.16s)]
*  There's a social value in being a victim. [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7955.16s)]
*  And so they will come up [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7957.16s)]
*  with stories about something terrible [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7959.16s)]
*  that happened to them. And then [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7961.16s)]
*  they came and they took me in their [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7963.16s)]
*  craft. Well, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard. [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7965.16s)]
*  Someone's fucking lying. [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7967.16s)]
*  Which one are you? Yeah. That show [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7969.16s)]
*  I recently watched that on Netflix and I was like [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7971.16s)]
*  it [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7973.16s)]
*  is so wild. Just expert [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7975.16s)]
*  actors. Black [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7977.16s)]
*  belt. It was crazy. To me the craziest [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7979.16s)]
*  one was when they knew that they were recording each [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7981.16s)]
*  other. So they're having a conversation [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7983.16s)]
*  but it's so performative. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7985.16s)]
*  Johnny is just talking like this. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7987.16s)]
*  Very calm. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7989.16s)]
*  Very calm. [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7991.16s)]
*  He's a good dude, man. [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7993.16s)]
*  I'm text friends with him [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7995.16s)]
*  and I was on the phone with him once when some shit was going [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7997.16s)]
*  down with him before the trials. We had [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=7999.16s)]
*  this long conversation on the phone. I was in Hawaii. [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8001.16s)]
*  And Stan helped. He said, [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8003.16s)]
*  hey, Johnny wants to talk to you. Can we talk? [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8005.16s)]
*  I said, fuck yeah. So I'm [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8007.16s)]
*  sitting there and I looked over [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8009.16s)]
*  my wife and I'm about to talk to Johnny Depp. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8011.16s)]
*  I'll be over here. [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8013.16s)]
*  So we're just lounging at the pool drinking [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8015.16s)]
*  margaritas and I'm on the phone with Johnny Depp. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8017.16s)]
*  And he's talking like that? Yes. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8019.16s)]
*  Yes. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8021.16s)]
*  He's a funny dude. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8023.16s)]
*  He calls Elon Musk mollusk. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8025.16s)]
*  Mollusk. [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8027.16s)]
*  He was all fucking playing the fucking [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8029.16s)]
*  good. He what? [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8031.16s)]
*  He was apparently involved [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8033.16s)]
*  somehow or another with Amber Heard. [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8035.16s)]
*  Damn, that's fucking sweet. He was just putting babies [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8037.16s)]
*  out there left and right. [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8039.16s)]
*  I'm kind of jealous of that. [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8041.16s)]
*  How many do you want? I mean [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8043.16s)]
*  in this reality, maybe not as many [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8045.16s)]
*  as in my fantasy. I want a bag. [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8047.16s)]
*  I would love to have a bunch of kids. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8049.16s)]
*  You're only 28. I know, but I'm [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8051.16s)]
*  not the one that has to get pregnant and deal with all that shit. [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8053.16s)]
*  Danny is. That's true. But I'm telling her [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8055.16s)]
*  we're going to have more baby mamas and she [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8057.16s)]
*  doesn't, she's not too into that idea. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8059.16s)]
*  I would love to have a bunch of it. [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8061.16s)]
*  We were talking last night about the [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8063.16s)]
*  surrogate thing about how weird it is that people [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8065.16s)]
*  farm off someone having their baby [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8067.16s)]
*  inside of them. This just doesn't seem [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8069.16s)]
*  right. It seems wild. [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8071.16s)]
*  That's what it is. I feel like there's such [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8073.16s)]
*  an important connection. Those 9 months, [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8075.16s)]
*  10 months of that baby being in there and just [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8077.16s)]
*  you holding your belly and you feeling it kick. [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8079.16s)]
*  How long does it take that mom [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8081.16s)]
*  to recover from that? Just like, there you go. [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8083.16s)]
*  Bye bye. [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8085.16s)]
*  Well, I told you about my neighbors. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8087.16s)]
*  These [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8089.16s)]
*  friends of mine that live down the street, [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8091.16s)]
*  this gay couple, and they [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8093.16s)]
*  hired this lady to be the surrogate. [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8095.16s)]
*  They pay her, they do the whole thing, [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8097.16s)]
*  they make sure she's got good nutrition, and [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8099.16s)]
*  at the end of the year she's like, eh, I'm keeping [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8101.16s)]
*  the kid. Fuck. [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8103.16s)]
*  Was that lady married too? [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8105.16s)]
*  I don't think so. [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8107.16s)]
*  I think she was single. [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8109.16s)]
*  I don't remember though, but I just remember [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8111.16s)]
*  them being heartbroken because they were all, [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8113.16s)]
*  they did eventually find another surrogate [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8115.16s)]
*  and now they do have a son. Now their son's older. [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8117.16s)]
*  Damn. I've known them for like [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8119.16s)]
*  15, 20 years. But at [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8121.16s)]
*  that time it was like, they [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8123.16s)]
*  were so bummed out. They were [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8125.16s)]
*  going to have a kid. Was it their sperm too? [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8127.16s)]
*  Yeah. Or one of them? I think they just [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8129.16s)]
*  bolted jizz in a cup and they fucking stirred it up. [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8131.16s)]
*  Nah, can you do that? Squirted it in there. [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8133.16s)]
*  Yeah, so you don't know whose jizz it is. [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8135.16s)]
*  Damn. [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8137.16s)]
*  They used to think that jizz, that there was certain [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8139.16s)]
*  jizz that would kill other jizz. [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8141.16s)]
*  It was killer sperm. There was this theory [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8143.16s)]
*  that got proposed. Alpha sperm? [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8145.16s)]
*  Yeah. It was like, [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8147.16s)]
*  it was a theory that people were running with and a [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8149.16s)]
*  lot of people were talking about, and then [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8151.16s)]
*  someone reexamined it and said, I don't think [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8153.16s)]
*  this is real. [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8155.16s)]
*  I don't think sperm has any ability to kill [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8157.16s)]
*  other sperm. But the idea was that [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8159.16s)]
*  some of your loads were like warriors [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8161.16s)]
*  and they would go out there and try to find [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8163.16s)]
*  the other loads in there and [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8165.16s)]
*  fuck them up. Yeah. [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8167.16s)]
*  You know, that's why your dick is shaped that way. [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8169.16s)]
*  The head of a penis [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8171.16s)]
*  is literally designed to plunge [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8173.16s)]
*  out the other sperm [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8175.16s)]
*  and pull it out. Really? [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8177.16s)]
*  So you think about the shape. So the head of the penis [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8179.16s)]
*  is like this, then it's got the lip, right? [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8181.16s)]
*  Well that's cool. It plunges [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8183.16s)]
*  in and the lip gets all the other jizz, [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8185.16s)]
*  scoops up back there. Because ladies [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8187.16s)]
*  back in the day were just getting nutted in? [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8189.16s)]
*  Yeah, well, the primate days. [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8191.16s)]
*  I mean, think about it. [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8193.16s)]
*  If a female was trying to mate, [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8195.16s)]
*  like one male would fuck her, [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8197.16s)]
*  another male would fuck her, everybody would fuck her. [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8199.16s)]
*  Nobody knew whose baby [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8201.16s)]
*  it was because there was no sense of [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8203.16s)]
*  paternity. It was just everybody fucked everybody. [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8205.16s)]
*  And so the penis was probably [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8207.16s)]
*  designed, [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8209.16s)]
*  evolved in that way to act as [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8211.16s)]
*  like a plunger. [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8213.16s)]
*  Where you're sucking out the other dude's jizz, [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8215.16s)]
*  shooting your own jizz. Damn. [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8217.16s)]
*  Yeah, I mean it's an evolutionary [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8219.16s)]
*  trait of the shape of the penis. [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8221.16s)]
*  Makes sense. Yeah, it does make sense [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8223.16s)]
*  if you look at it like a shape of a [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8225.16s)]
*  head. And then having a little head. [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8227.16s)]
*  So why is his timbs curved? [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8229.16s)]
*  Someone who probably ride in them and broke it. [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8231.16s)]
*  Penile fracture. [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8233.16s)]
*  That's real. My buddy Joe [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8235.16s)]
*  Riggs. It happened to my buddy Joe Riggs. [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8237.16s)]
*  Joe Riggs, the MMA fighter? Yeah, we both lived with him [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8239.16s)]
*  at one point. He broke his dick? Yep. [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8241.16s)]
*  Trying to be a hero. Of course he did. [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8243.16s)]

*  Guys, you see Mariah went to [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8247.16s)]
*  visit her parents in Utah. It's a [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8249.16s)]
*  big Mormon country. And when she was [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8251.16s)]
*  in the backwoods, there was this old guy taking [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8253.16s)]
*  pictures with like 30 young girls [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8255.16s)]
*  in their dresses. [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8257.16s)]
*  Man, getting those girls [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8259.16s)]
*  on board with those beliefs. [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8261.16s)]
*  Early brain wash. [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8263.16s)]
*  They get them on board when they're young. [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8265.16s)]
*  Look, there's cults. [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8267.16s)]
*  But when there's a religion [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8269.16s)]
*  where you know the guy who made it, [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8271.16s)]
*  like Joseph Smith [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8273.16s)]
*  was a real con man. [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8275.16s)]
*  He was 14 years old when he wrote all that stuff. [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8277.16s)]
*  Which one was that? Mormonism. [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8279.16s)]
*  14? [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8281.16s)]
*  Yeah, he said he found golden tablets [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8283.16s)]
*  that contained the lost work of Jesus. [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8285.16s)]
*  And only he could read them because he [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8287.16s)]
*  had a magic rock. And then [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8289.16s)]
*  the angels came and took the gold [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8291.16s)]
*  tablets away, he said. So when the townspeople [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8293.16s)]
*  said, where's the tablets? The angels came and took them away. [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8295.16s)]
*  What if though? [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8297.16s)]
*  What if? [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8299.16s)]
*  Who's to say? [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8301.16s)]
*  Imagine if it was true. [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8303.16s)]
*  So he started it [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8305.16s)]
*  all these years later. [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8307.16s)]
*  But one of the weird things about Mormonism [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8309.16s)]
*  is like, if it is a cult, [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8311.16s)]
*  I guess it is, they are the nicest [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8313.16s)]
*  fucking cult members ever. [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8315.16s)]
*  They're so nice. [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8317.16s)]
*  I don't really know any Mormons. [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8319.16s)]
*  Oh, I know a ton. [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8321.16s)]
*  I go to Utah a lot. [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8323.16s)]
*  I know a lot of them from there. [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8325.16s)]
*  I had some neighbors [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8327.16s)]
*  that we were friends with back in LA [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8329.16s)]
*  that were Mormons. They were so nice. [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8331.16s)]
*  And they know, it was started by that dude [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8333.16s)]
*  when he was 14. Don't look that deep into it. [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8335.16s)]
*  They believe it. [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8337.16s)]
*  It's interesting, we have this one family [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8339.16s)]
*  and they went [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8341.16s)]
*  they left the country for like a year [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8343.16s)]
*  for their kids, for their education [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8345.16s)]
*  and took them to Europe. [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8347.16s)]
*  And then when they came back, they left the church. [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8349.16s)]
*  Not being there for a year, [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8351.16s)]
*  they came back like, this is kind of ridiculous. [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8353.16s)]
*  But she was talking about it and she said [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8355.16s)]
*  one of the things that she recognized, [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8357.16s)]
*  it makes her very vulnerable [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8359.16s)]
*  to like charlatans and gurus [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8361.16s)]
*  and stuff like that because [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8363.16s)]
*  she was kind of programmed [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8365.16s)]
*  to always believe the preacher and [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8367.16s)]
*  programmed to always believe the church. [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8369.16s)]
*  But she was kind of recognizing it in herself [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8371.16s)]
*  that she has this flaw [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8373.16s)]
*  in the way she views the world. [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8375.16s)]
*  That's scary. [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8377.16s)]
*  Some of those guys are such good talkers. [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8379.16s)]
*  The one, the Waco guy here. [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8381.16s)]
*  You see videos of him talk. [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8383.16s)]
*  Holy shit, he truly believed it. [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8385.16s)]
*  Yeah, Branch Davidians. [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8387.16s)]
*  He was the prophet. [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8389.16s)]
*  Yeah, and it's always this guy [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8391.16s)]
*  who fucks everybody. [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8393.16s)]
*  He fucked everybody's wife. [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8395.16s)]
*  See, that's something I could [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8397.16s)]
*  get behind. [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8399.16s)]
*  Yeah, they only could fuck him. [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8403.16s)]
*  It's really wild though [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8405.16s)]
*  that that sort of style [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8407.16s)]
*  of running a group of people [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8409.16s)]
*  has always existed. [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8411.16s)]
*  Mark Andreessen, this [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8413.16s)]
*  very wealthy and famous tech guy [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8415.16s)]
*  was on the podcast. He was telling me [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8417.16s)]
*  there's active cults in California right now. [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8419.16s)]
*  They're just successful. [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8421.16s)]
*  Really? How many? [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8423.16s)]
*  Not on social media type stuff too, I would cry. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8425.16s)]
*  I don't think they go on social media. [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8427.16s)]
*  They'd probably kill everything if they had that. [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8429.16s)]
*  Yeah, you gotta stay fast [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8431.16s)]
*  and keep moving if you're running a cult today. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8433.16s)]
*  That's Satan. Stay off that. [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8435.16s)]
*  Crazy. [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8437.16s)]
*  This place that we almost had down here [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8439.16s)]
*  when you watch that documentary, [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8441.16s)]
*  holy hell. We were talking about this [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8443.16s)]
*  last night. We always say it's like [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8445.16s)]
*  the beginning of all cult movies. [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8447.16s)]
*  It looks like they're great. [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8449.16s)]
*  Dancing in the water. [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8451.16s)]
*  Wild Wild Country. [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8453.16s)]
*  His books. He's got a lot of [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8455.16s)]
*  good books. Yeah. [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8457.16s)]
*  I love how he would fucking wear iced out [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8459.16s)]
*  watches, take private jets, [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8461.16s)]
*  Rolls Royce. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8463.16s)]
*  The hypocrisy is by the people, [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8465.16s)]
*  of the people, [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8467.16s)]
*  for the people. [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8469.16s)]
*  He had me convinced. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8471.16s)]
*  The people are retarded. [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8473.16s)]
*  Have you ever seen that? [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8477.16s)]
*  That fucker is... [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8479.16s)]
*  There was so [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8481.16s)]
*  hard to see a guru [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8483.16s)]
*  saying, find that video. [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8485.16s)]
*  I fucking love that video. [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8487.16s)]
*  That was a well made documentary too. [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8489.16s)]
*  Wild Wild Country, right? [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8491.16s)]
*  It wasn't him that was fucked up though. [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8493.16s)]
*  It was Sheila. [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8495.16s)]
*  She was kinda hot. [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8497.16s)]
*  He is... [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8499.16s)]
*  Imagine getting him on the part [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8503.16s)]
*  and he does this. [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8505.16s)]
*  The government [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8507.16s)]
*  by the people, [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8511.16s)]
*  of the people, [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8515.16s)]
*  for the people. [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8517.16s)]
*  But the people are retarded. [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8519.16s)]
*  That's too good. [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8525.16s)]
*  It goes on further but you get the point. [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8527.16s)]
*  But also, [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8529.16s)]
*  if anybody seems like a guru, [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8531.16s)]
*  it's that guy. [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8533.16s)]
*  You look in his eyes, [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8535.16s)]
*  he looks like a legit [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8537.16s)]
*  wise guru. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8539.16s)]
*  And it seems like his... [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8541.16s)]
*  I've read one of his books too. [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8543.16s)]
*  His idea of the guru [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8545.16s)]
*  was very interesting. [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8547.16s)]
*  Very legit. [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8549.16s)]
*  But what happened, [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8551.16s)]
*  what went down in that town, [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8553.16s)]
*  that was crazy. [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8555.16s)]
*  They poisoned people. [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8557.16s)]
*  And then brought all the homeless in to vote for them. [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8559.16s)]
*  And the homeless people were like, [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8561.16s)]
*  finally we've got a community. [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8563.16s)]
*  They were like, yeah, we're done with you. [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8565.16s)]
*  Ship them back out. [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8567.16s)]
*  Cults, man, [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8569.16s)]
*  it really is a strange thing [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8571.16s)]
*  that people want to follow [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8573.16s)]
*  this one person. [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8575.16s)]
*  And this one person [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8577.16s)]
*  leads this community and can't be challenged [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8579.16s)]
*  or questioned. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8581.16s)]
*  It's so much easier back in the day [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8583.16s)]
*  without the socials. [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8585.16s)]
*  Yeah, because you could just [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8587.16s)]
*  lie about stuff. [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8589.16s)]
*  Do you ever see the guy from Australia [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8591.16s)]
*  that said he was Jesus? [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8593.16s)]
*  He literally says he's the reincarnation of Jesus [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8595.16s)]
*  and there's this woman that's with him [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8597.16s)]
*  and he says that she's Mary. [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8599.16s)]
*  And she really believed that she was Mary. [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8601.16s)]
*  He said that he was Mary in the past. [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8603.16s)]
*  But he said this other girl was Mary. [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8605.16s)]
*  And they're like, hey, what about this other girl? [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8607.16s)]
*  She says she was Mary. [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8609.16s)]
*  That was a mistake. [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8611.16s)]
*  That's why she found out. [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8613.16s)]
*  That was it. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8615.16s)]
*  I think that was a big one. [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8617.16s)]
*  Because then all of a sudden everybody was like, [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8619.16s)]
*  wait a minute, wait a minute. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8621.16s)]
*  Can you walk on water though? [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8623.16s)]
*  It's weird, a lot of religious people, [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8625.16s)]
*  they'll just look at the beliefs. [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8627.16s)]
*  They won't look at who formed those beliefs [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8629.16s)]
*  and who was it? Even Jehovah's Witnesses, [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8631.16s)]
*  this Charles Taze Russell, [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8633.16s)]
*  didn't even know Greek. [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8635.16s)]
*  And he wrote this whole new translation [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8637.16s)]
*  of the Bible. And everyone got on board. [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8639.16s)]
*  Oh wow. [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8641.16s)]
*  There's always people like that. [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8643.16s)]
*  But the original Bible itself, [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8645.16s)]
*  one of the weird things [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8647.16s)]
*  is the Dead Sea Scrolls, which is the oldest [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8649.16s)]
*  versions of some of the stories in the Bible. [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8651.16s)]
*  They're different. They're in Aramaic. [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8653.16s)]
*  Should we all [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8655.16s)]
*  just read that now? [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8657.16s)]
*  Why are we [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8659.16s)]
*  going on the New Testament [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8661.16s)]
*  instead of the Old Testament? Is the Old Testament [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8663.16s)]
*  the real thing? Yeah, that doesn't make sense. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8665.16s)]
*  I always wonder, [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8667.16s)]
*  where did it start? [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8669.16s)]
*  What was the experience that led [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8671.16s)]
*  these people to write these things [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8673.16s)]
*  down? It makes sense if it was mushroom [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8675.16s)]
*  psychedelics. That makes the most sense. [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8677.16s)]
*  People were fucking tripping [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8679.16s)]
*  and seeing these [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8681.16s)]
*  stories and writing them down. [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8683.16s)]
*  Well that's Marcus Aurelius too. [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8685.16s)]
*  One of the more interesting things about diving [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8687.16s)]
*  deep into ancient Greek culture [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8689.16s)]
*  is that you find [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8691.16s)]
*  this book, The Immortality Key [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8693.16s)]
*  from this guy Brian Mororescu, [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8695.16s)]
*  who found that the Illucinian [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8697.16s)]
*  mysteries, when all these people were coming [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8699.16s)]
*  to Eleusis from all over the world and [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8701.16s)]
*  taking part in these mystery ceremonies, [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8703.16s)]
*  they never knew what they were doing until recently. [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8705.16s)]
*  And recently they started doing [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8707.16s)]
*  these tests on some of the vessels that they [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8709.16s)]
*  found, the wine vessels. And they were [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8711.16s)]
*  laced with psychedelics. [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8713.16s)]
*  And now they know for sure, and they've opened up a field [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8715.16s)]
*  of study at Harvard, and they're [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8717.16s)]
*  exploring this, and they're doing more [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8719.16s)]
*  testing and more studying. They know [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8721.16s)]
*  that the people that founded democracy were [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8723.16s)]
*  tripping balls. [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8725.16s)]
*  Which makes sense. I think so. [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8727.16s)]
*  You'd have to be tripping to say, look, [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8729.16s)]
*  instead of one person running things, let's all vote. [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8731.16s)]
*  Let's all vote. [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8733.16s)]
*  Because nobody else is doing that. [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8735.16s)]
*  Everybody was like, off with their head. The king is [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8737.16s)]
*  here. Lay down the throne. [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8739.16s)]
*  That's crazy. It's one king [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8741.16s)]
*  running the show. Was there a point when you were [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8743.16s)]
*  super religious or not at all? When I [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8745.16s)]
*  was little. I was a little kid. [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8747.16s)]
*  I went to Catholic school when I was first grade, but [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8749.16s)]
*  the nun that taught Catholic school [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8751.16s)]
*  was such a cunt that it was like [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8753.16s)]
*  easy to realize that it wasn't real. [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8755.16s)]
*  I'd like lost all of my faith [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8757.16s)]
*  in organized religion when I was seven years old. [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8759.16s)]
*  And your parents weren't [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8761.16s)]
*  putting on you? No. Well, my parents [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8763.16s)]
*  split up when I was young, and then my mom [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8765.16s)]
*  married my stepdad. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8767.16s)]
*  My stepdad was a hippie. [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8769.16s)]
*  And then we lived in San Francisco [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8771.16s)]
*  when I was seven years old. [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8773.16s)]
*  So it was like the height of the Vietnam War. [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8775.16s)]
*  The hippie movements in full bloom. [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8777.16s)]
*  My stepdad had long hair. [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8779.16s)]
*  We lived around all these [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8781.16s)]
*  counterculture people. [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8783.16s)]
*  That was a big part [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8785.16s)]
*  of my upbringing from seven to eleven. [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8787.16s)]
*  So there was no religion [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8789.16s)]
*  back then. [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8791.16s)]
*  But I think religion is a good scaffolding for people. [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8793.16s)]
*  And I think there's something [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8795.16s)]
*  absolutely beautiful about [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8797.16s)]
*  a lot of the ideas of a lot of organized religions [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8799.16s)]
*  that really, really benefit people. [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8801.16s)]
*  But I also think it could be used as a tool [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8803.16s)]
*  to control people. [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8805.16s)]
*  Like almost everything. [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8807.16s)]
*  My mom, I feel like it's good for her just the community [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8809.16s)]
*  sense. Because she doesn't have like, we go to the gym, [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8811.16s)]
*  we go to the green room, we go to the comic store, we have a community [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8813.16s)]
*  to where she just [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8815.16s)]
*  believes in her religion so much [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8817.16s)]
*  because she gets this joy from going to church [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8819.16s)]
*  because she's around the community. [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8821.16s)]
*  But she just, it's so crazy [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8823.16s)]
*  she would look me dead in the eyes and tell me that her [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8825.16s)]
*  religion, Christianity, is the only religion [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8827.16s)]
*  all the other religions are made up. [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8829.16s)]
*  Yeah. Muslims will tell you the same thing. [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8831.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8833.16s)]
*  That's the problem. It's like [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8835.16s)]
*  somebody's got to be wrong. [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8837.16s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. I wonder who's the most [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8839.16s)]
*  wealthy religion. [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8841.16s)]
*  It's the latter days, or what is it? I looked it up [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8843.16s)]
*  recently actually. Scientologists. [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8845.16s)]
*  Rich. They own a lot [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8847.16s)]
*  of real estate. Yeah, really? [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8849.16s)]
*  The Scientologist is an interesting one [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8851.16s)]
*  because they sued the federal government to get [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8853.16s)]
*  tax exempt status. What? [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8855.16s)]
*  Yeah, not only do they know who made that [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8857.16s)]
*  one, but the guy who made that one [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8859.16s)]
*  was an author. Not [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8861.16s)]

*  occasionally [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8923.16s)]
*  kids. Yeah. [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8925.16s)]
*  That's only one out of every three though. [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8927.16s)]
*  Occasionally there's some molestation. [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8929.16s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8931.16s)]
*  The Catholic Church is so [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8933.16s)]
*  inexorably connected to molestation [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8935.16s)]
*  that if you say Catholic priest [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8937.16s)]
*  people think your kid's getting [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8939.16s)]

*  that is. That's fucking insane. That's insane. [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8943.16s)]
*  There's not another thing on earth like that [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8945.16s)]
*  other than actual child molesters [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8947.16s)]
*  where you automatically [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8949.16s)]
*  have at least some connection [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8951.16s)]
*  in your mind. Like if a Catholic priest [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8953.16s)]
*  says, hey, I want your son to [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8955.16s)]
*  come over my house for a sleepover. You're like, [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8957.16s)]
*  what? What the fuck [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8959.16s)]
*  are you talking about? But if like a boxing coach [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8961.16s)]
*  is like, hey, we're going to take some [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8963.16s)]
*  kids over the house for a sleepover, we're going to take them on an early [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8965.16s)]
*  morning run, you know, and then we're going to do this [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8967.16s)]
*  and we'll have them back to you by Saturday and the kids [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8969.16s)]
*  come back all laughing. You know, like [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8971.16s)]
*  this guy's been doing this, they run camps, [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8973.16s)]
*  everybody camps out. [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8975.16s)]
*  Church camp. It can happen. It's normal. [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8977.16s)]
*  But if it's a Catholic priest, everybody goes, [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8979.16s)]
*  what? Yeah. You're going to be [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8981.16s)]
*  alone with the kids? The fuck you are. [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8983.16s)]
*  That's crazy. Some religions too, like [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8985.16s)]
*  if a kid says, hey, this guy, this elder [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8987.16s)]
*  or whatever molested me, they have it [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8989.16s)]
*  in their rules [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8991.16s)]
*  or whatever that there's need to be two witnesses. [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8993.16s)]
*  There needs to be two witnesses [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8995.16s)]
*  or didn't [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8997.16s)]
*  take precautions. Jesus. [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=8999.16s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9001.16s)]
*  And the other thing about that is that [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9003.16s)]
*  it's somehow or another repeating [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9005.16s)]
*  cycle. The people that get [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9007.16s)]
*  molested wind up molesting other people. [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9009.16s)]
*  That's weird. Oh, they create the demons [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9011.16s)]
*  fucking for real. It's like a vampire thing. [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9013.16s)]
*  Like you're getting bit by a vampire. Oh, it is. [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9015.16s)]

*  seen like the Catholic Church [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9023.16s)]
*  and the Vatican? No. It's insane. [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9025.16s)]

*  the Muslim Center. [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9059.16s)]
*  I don't remember what it was called. [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9061.16s)]

*  do get converted just by the gorgeousness of it. [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9079.16s)]

*  a country. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9091.16s)]
*  It's actually a country inside [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9093.16s)]
*  of Rome. So that's one of the ways they [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9095.16s)]
*  keep the child molesters is they can't [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9097.16s)]

*  we were trying to figure out if we're gonna go to Egypt [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9143.16s)]
*  and Greece or just Greece. [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9145.16s)]
*  And so we chose to just go to Greece and Greece [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9147.16s)]
*  was incredible. And they've been there. When you go [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9149.16s)]

*  hundred years old and probably older [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9155.16s)]
*  because they built it upon an [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9157.16s)]
*  existing structure, the [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9159.16s)]
*  Acropolis and they don't know how old [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9161.16s)]

*  been there for thousands of years before [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9165.16s)]
*  that. Was that a good age to bring your daughters? [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9167.16s)]
*  Yeah. Pretty good age. They enjoyed it. [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9169.16s)]
*  I mean I think any age is a good age to [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9171.16s)]
*  get kids to see different things, [[02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9173.16s)]
*  different cultures. I mean I've been traveling [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9175.16s)]
*  with my kids since they were really little. [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9177.16s)]
*  We took them to other countries [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9179.16s)]
*  when they were like two years old. Just a plane [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9181.16s)]
*  ride. Yeah, plane ride is a bummer. [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9183.16s)]
*  But with kids dude you give them a fucking iPad [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9185.16s)]
*  with some movies. Yeah. They just chill. [[02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9187.16s)]
*  Give them snacks. [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9189.16s)]
*  So seats don't bother them. [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9191.16s)]
*  Give them a little heroin. [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9193.16s)]
*  Seats don't bother them because they're little. So they can just [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9195.16s)]
*  sit in that seat and fucking chill. [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9197.16s)]
*  iPads have amazing battery life. [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9199.16s)]
*  You can watch fucking seven movies in a row [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9201.16s)]
*  next thing you know you're in Italy. Speaking of heroin [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9203.16s)]
*  you had that one doctor [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9205.16s)]
*  Carl Hart. Yeah, Carl Hart on. [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9207.16s)]
*  And I listened to that and then we did [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9209.16s)]
*  a podcast on ours and it got [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9211.16s)]
*  clipped. I was like yeah I would probably do some heroin [[02:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9213.16s)]
*  with him. And it got clipped up [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9215.16s)]
*  all everywhere. Me [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9217.16s)]
*  promoting heroin and doing heroin and stuff. [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9219.16s)]
*  It was pretty funny. [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9221.16s)]
*  But that was a fucking interesting one. [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9223.16s)]
*  He's fascinating. He's a fascinating [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9225.16s)]
*  guy. Very fascinating. Yeah. [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9227.16s)]
*  He had a very interesting outlook on drugs. [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9229.16s)]
*  Well you know he was a straight laced guy who didn't [[02:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9231.16s)]
*  do any drugs at all until he became a researcher. [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9233.16s)]
*  And then when he was a clinical researcher he realized [[02:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9235.16s)]
*  he's a professor at Columbia. And he realized [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9237.16s)]
*  when he was doing research like oh our [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9239.16s)]
*  perceptions of the effects of drugs are all [[02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9241.16s)]
*  just a lot of propaganda and bullshit. [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9243.16s)]
*  And a lot of the problem is like [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9245.16s)]
*  I mean pure drugs, abuse [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9247.16s)]
*  of these drugs. [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9249.16s)]

*  Candy. It's not [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9255.16s)]
*  candy is the worst drug. [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9257.16s)]
*  Just kids for like giving them fucking sour [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9259.16s)]
*  patch kids and skittles and they're just fucking [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9261.16s)]
*  deeped out on sugar for a little bit. [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9263.16s)]
*  Or it's okay for like a 350 [[02:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9265.16s)]
*  pound person who's clearly going to die [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9267.16s)]
*  from a heart attack to go into a gas station [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9269.16s)]
*  load up on the ice cream, load up on the candy [[02:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9271.16s)]
*  and head out. They're killing themselves. [[02:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9273.16s)]
*  There's a lot of people killing themselves in this country with food. [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9275.16s)]
*  But the drug one was just [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9277.16s)]
*  I always thought that was interesting. Cause I was [[02:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9279.16s)]
*  terrified of marijuana growing up. [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9281.16s)]
*  My dad was a cop. My mom was a nurse. [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9283.16s)]
*  It's just in my head that this is just [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9285.16s)]
*  fucking poison. Bad for you. [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9287.16s)]
*  When did you first try it? This fucker made me. [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9289.16s)]
*  Put a joint in my mouth. [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9291.16s)]
*  Well we'd be training twice a day [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9293.16s)]
*  and he'd come home and still be like let's go do [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9295.16s)]
*  something and just be jacked up. I'd be like bro [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9297.16s)]
*  there's a lot of good athletes smoking [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9299.16s)]
*  this weed. Just try it dude. [[02:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9301.16s)]
*  Cause I had some energy. I'd train in the morning. [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9303.16s)]
*  I'd be 19 years old and move down to Phoenix. Train in the morning. [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9305.16s)]
*  Train at night. Him and his buddy [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9307.16s)]
*  are chilling and we're at the apartment. I'm just like [[02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9309.16s)]
*  wanting to do something. So I took a puff [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9311.16s)]
*  and I fucking chilled [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9313.16s)]
*  out for a little bit. It changed my life. [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9315.16s)]
*  I was able to. Cause it's hard [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9317.16s)]
*  to fucking get into that state [[02:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9319.16s)]
*  but now it's a lot easier. [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9321.16s)]
*  I mean some people who do it [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9323.16s)]
*  though and just every time [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9325.16s)]
*  something's going on and they just smoke and then they're [[02:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9327.16s)]
*  just lazy. I think it's bad for a lot of [[02:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9329.16s)]
*  people. Yeah I agree. I think some people [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9331.16s)]
*  are just lazy. And if you give them weed [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9333.16s)]
*  and blame it on the weed. Yeah. [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9335.16s)]
*  It doesn't make me lazy. It makes me [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9337.16s)]
*  the opposite. If I smoke weed and I haven't [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9339.16s)]
*  done the things I need to do I go oh god [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9341.16s)]
*  I gotta go to work. Yeah. Same. I start freaking. [[02:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9343.16s)]
*  I like that paranoia. I do too. It makes me [[02:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9345.16s)]
*  start thinking about [[02:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9347.16s)]
*  what I gotta fuck. I gotta dial in [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9349.16s)]
*  my diet. I gotta fucking. Yeah. [[02:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9351.16s)]
*  I gotta make. I gotta get to the gym. I gotta train. [[02:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9353.16s)]

*  I gotta do everything right. [[02:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9359.16s)]
*  It gives me that paranoia. Do you know there's a thing [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9361.16s)]
*  that people say commonly [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9363.16s)]
*  that when someone becomes a champion they almost get [[02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9365.16s)]
*  30% better just because of [[02:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9367.16s)]
*  being a champion. Do you feel like that's [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9369.16s)]
*  gonna happen to you? I feel like I felt that [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9371.16s)]
*  after I [[02:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9373.16s)]
*  beat [[02:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9375.16s)]
*  Alfred in my contender series [[02:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9377.16s)]
*  fight. I felt like I won. I just felt like I got [[02:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9379.16s)]
*  way better just because I had just [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9381.16s)]
*  fought at the biggest name, biggest fight. [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9383.16s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9385.16s)]
*  I feel like [[02:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9387.16s)]
*  I don't know. I feel like I have a lot of work to do. [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9389.16s)]
*  I need to get back to the gym as fucking fast as [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9391.16s)]
*  possible. But knowing how big of a beast [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9393.16s)]
*  Alja was and knowing that you sat him down [[02:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9395.16s)]
*  with the right hand. How much confidence is that? [[02:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9397.16s)]
*  It wasn't even. More of the confidence [[02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9399.16s)]
*  I got was just not getting taken down. He had me up against the [[02:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9401.16s)]
*  fence where he wanted me twice. Couldn't take me down. [[02:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9403.16s)]
*  Knocking him out. I knew I could do that. [[02:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9405.16s)]
*  The question was can I not get taken [[02:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9407.16s)]
*  down. He took Henry down four times. [[02:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9409.16s)]
*  He had me up against the fence exactly [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9411.16s)]
*  where he wanted me. [[02:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9413.16s)]
*  He couldn't take me down. That's where I got my most confidence from [[02:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9415.16s)]
*  for sure. Knocking him out. [[02:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9417.16s)]
*  I felt like I knew I could do that. [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9419.16s)]
*  It's such a big advantage [[02:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9421.16s)]
*  to being a really good striker. [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9423.16s)]
*  Because if your whole thing is [[02:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9425.16s)]
*  you have to close the distance and clinch with someone [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9427.16s)]
*  and you're a good striker, but [[02:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9429.16s)]
*  you don't. It's not your thing. [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9431.16s)]
*  You're not just looking to put it on somebody. [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9433.16s)]
*  You're using it as a tool to [[02:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9435.16s)]
*  enact your skill set. [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9437.16s)]
*  To have that [[02:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9439.16s)]
*  fucking dish. One shot. Also [[02:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9441.16s)]
*  for marketing, how many times have people seen [[02:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9443.16s)]
*  that Eddie Wineland knockout? [[02:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9445.16s)]
*  That one is crazy. That's one of my favorite. [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9447.16s)]
*  That one was just a oop. [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9449.16s)]
*  That's the way he slapped. It was at the apex. [[02:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9451.16s)]
*  It was quiet. You just hear [[02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9453.16s)]
*  him going. He was snoring. [[02:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9455.16s)]
*  That was crazy. Who's the last [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9457.16s)]
*  person in the smaller weight class divisions [[02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9459.16s)]
*  to one shot KO people? To win the [[02:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9461.16s)]
*  belt even by KO. To walk [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9463.16s)]
*  off and KO people though. Has there ever? [[02:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9465.16s)]
*  Well Marlon one shot KO's people [[02:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9469.16s)]
*  and Corey's one shot KO people. [[02:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9471.16s)]
*  With knees. [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9473.16s)]
*  With one straight right hand. [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9475.16s)]
*  But I feel like [[02:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9479.16s)]
*  once I get back to real training, I'm really hoping [[02:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9481.16s)]
*  these stem cells fucking just [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9483.16s)]
*  I'm optimistic. [[02:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9485.16s)]
*  And by the way, you can come back once a month [[02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9487.16s)]
*  and keep your shot up. [[02:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9489.16s)]
*  Brigham was a man. A very knowledgeable dude. [[02:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9491.16s)]
*  Ways to Well. Super knowledgeable. [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9493.16s)]
*  They stack a bunch of different things [[02:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9495.16s)]
*  together. They're beneficial. He's [[02:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9497.16s)]
*  always up on the latest studies. [[02:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9499.16s)]
*  He's also got this incredible memory. [[02:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9501.16s)]
*  So you talk to him about he can relay all [[02:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9503.16s)]
*  the information in a very dissolvable [[02:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9505.16s)]
*  way. And they do peptides and everything [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9507.16s)]
*  there. Everything. [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9509.16s)]
*  I'm all about the peptides. [[02:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9511.16s)]
*  We were talking about this last night as well [[02:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9513.16s)]
*  that the UFC is trying to [[02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9515.16s)]
*  allow people to take peptides again. [[02:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9517.16s)]
*  Specifically BBC 157. [[02:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9519.16s)]
*  Which just helps you heal. [[02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9521.16s)]
*  That's really what it's about. It just helps [[02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9523.16s)]
*  tissue, soft tissue damage repair quicker. [[02:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9525.16s)]
*  What about the ipamoralin, the CJC? [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9527.16s)]
*  That does not help with joints [[02:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9529.16s)]
*  and ligaments and bone density. [[02:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9531.16s)]
*  Yes it does. And it also promotes [[02:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9533.16s)]
*  human growth hormone. [[02:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9535.16s)]
*  And that would be beneficial as well. [[02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9537.16s)]
*  Look, I [[02:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9539.16s)]
*  just think this whole idea of purity [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9541.16s)]
*  is horseshit. Because [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9543.16s)]
*  there's not... The purity [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9545.16s)]
*  in sport in terms of like supplementation [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9547.16s)]
*  are you allowed to take creatine? [[02:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9549.16s)]
*  You are. Okay, well creatine is a performance [[02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9551.16s)]
*  enhancing substance. 100% [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9553.16s)]
*  protein. Absolutely. It's not just physically [[02:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9555.16s)]
*  enhancing. Creatine is [[02:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9557.16s)]
*  cognitively enhancing. There's some [[02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9559.16s)]
*  great benefits to supplementing with [[02:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9561.16s)]
*  creatine. And then there's also [[02:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9563.16s)]
*  you're stacking BCAAs. Your branch [[02:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9565.16s)]
*  chain amino acids. It's going to give you a benefit. [[02:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9567.16s)]
*  Those are supplements. You're getting it from [[02:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9569.16s)]
*  a supplemental form instead of from your food. [[02:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9571.16s)]
*  And you're getting it on top of your food. [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9573.16s)]
*  You're stacking it. You're doing it with a bunch of other [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9575.16s)]
*  stuff. You're taking beta alanine before [[02:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9577.16s)]
*  you exercise. That's performance enhancing. [[02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9579.16s)]
*  If you take cordyceps mushrooms, [[02:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9581.16s)]
*  cordyceps mushrooms like Onnit Shroom Tech, [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9583.16s)]
*  100% helps you [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9585.16s)]
*  hit an extra gear when you're training. [[02:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9587.16s)]
*  There's a lot of pre-workouts that are illegal. [[02:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9589.16s)]
*  There's a lot of stuff that's legal that is 100% [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9591.16s)]
*  performance enhancing. I think what [[02:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9593.16s)]
*  we have to keep people doing is doing [[02:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9595.16s)]
*  supernatural levels of testosterone [[02:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9597.16s)]
*  and growth hormone and things that [[02:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9599.16s)]
*  allow like Vitor Belfort to become [[02:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9601.16s)]
*  TRT. Alistair. [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9603.16s)]
*  Yeah, Alistair. [[02:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9605.16s)]
*  But even that, it's like, listen, [[02:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9607.16s)]
*  if anybody should be able to fucking do that, it's guys [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9609.16s)]
*  you fight in a cage for a living. If anybody [[02:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9611.16s)]
*  should be able to do that, to like be at their [[02:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9613.16s)]
*  prime, as long as they weigh 135 pounds [[02:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9615.16s)]
*  when they fucking step on that scale, [[02:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9617.16s)]
*  I think we're wrapped [[02:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9619.16s)]
*  around this idea of cheating. I think [[02:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9621.16s)]
*  we should be wrapped around this idea of optimizing. [[02:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9623.16s)]
*  I think optimization should be the most [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9625.16s)]
*  important thing. Yeah, I mean, [[02:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9627.16s)]
*  if you're 35, 36, 37 [[02:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9629.16s)]
*  in the UFC, you've been competing in the UFC for 10 [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9631.16s)]
*  years and you're not allowed to just [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9633.16s)]
*  do any of these peptides. [[02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9635.16s)]
*  You're not allowed to do any of this. You go to the [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9637.16s)]
*  blood work and the doctor's like, hey, you're lacking [[02:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9639.16s)]
*  in these areas. This could benefit [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9641.16s)]
*  your life. Yeah. [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9643.16s)]
*  It'll change your ability to train, change your performances [[02:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9645.16s)]
*  inside the octagon, change your [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9647.16s)]
*  ability to recover. [[02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9649.16s)]
*  Being able to recover and train. [[02:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9651.16s)]
*  Like I haven't trained in the last few [[02:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9653.16s)]
*  weeks and it's, oh, [[02:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9655.16s)]
*  it's crazy. Well, this is the thing about Jiu-Jitsu, [[02:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9657.16s)]
*  right? Jiu-Jitsu, [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9659.16s)]
*  specifically Abu Dhabi, which is the [[02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9661.16s)]
*  premier Jiu-Jitsu organization, [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9663.16s)]
*  they don't test for steroids and everybody openly [[02:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9665.16s)]
*  takes steroids. Yep. And so [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9667.16s)]
*  this is how they're able to compete [[02:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9669.16s)]
*  with guys like, when you're at [[02:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9671.16s)]
*  that level, like Gordon Ryan [[02:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9673.16s)]
*  level, Gordon is open about steroid use. [[02:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9675.16s)]
*  He trains 365 [[02:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9677.16s)]
*  days a year. [[02:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9679.16s)]
*  How are you going to do that? Yeah. [[02:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9681.16s)]
*  If you're not Jiu-Jitsu. No chance. How are you going [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9683.16s)]
*  to recover? How are you recovering? You're [[02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9685.16s)]
*  weightlifting in the morning and then you're doing Jiu-Jitsu at night [[02:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9687.16s)]
*  every day, 365 [[02:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9689.16s)]
*  days a year. [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9691.16s)]
*  That'd be nice to be able to train like that. [[02:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9693.16s)]
*  That's the way you train like that. You train like that [[02:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9695.16s)]
*  on Jiu-Jitsu. And if you do, you become, [[02:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9697.16s)]
*  I mean, if you also are super intelligent, [[02:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9699.16s)]
*  super dedicated, and you have John [[02:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9701.16s)]
*  Donahue in your club, you become Gordon [[02:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9703.16s)]
*  Ryan at 27, [[02:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9705.16s)]
*  which is just bonkers. Insane. [[02:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9707.16s)]
*  Greatest of all time, hands [[02:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9709.16s)]
*  down, consensus, no one's arguing. [[02:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9711.16s)]
*  Yeah. 27. [[02:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9713.16s)]
*  And then you get to see two of those gorillas go at it, [[02:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9715.16s)]
*  like Andre Galvo and [[02:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9717.16s)]
*  those ADCCs, [[02:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9719.16s)]
*  it's fucking sweet. Imagine if kids like, [[02:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9721.16s)]
*  I mean, Kade Ruttolo and [[02:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9723.16s)]
*  Ty Ruttolo, those guys [[02:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9725.16s)]
*  on that stuff would be fucking a nightmare. [[02:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9727.16s)]
*  Well, you know what though? They're so [[02:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9729.16s)]
*  young, they shouldn't be on anything. [[02:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9731.16s)]
*  Don't ruin your fucking endocrine system. [[02:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9733.16s)]
*  They're competing at such a high level without [[02:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9735.16s)]
*  it. But as time goes on, [[02:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9737.16s)]
*  you know, like even guys are [[02:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9739.16s)]
*  19, 20, when you hit 23, [[02:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9741.16s)]
*  24, my fucking shoulder, [[02:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9743.16s)]
*  my back, my ribs, like how many [[02:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9745.16s)]
*  Jiu-Jitsu guys do you know that have fucked [[02:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9747.16s)]
*  up backs? Yeah. [[02:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9749.16s)]
*  All of them. Everybody. [[02:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9751.16s)]
*  Fucked up necks. Fucked up backs. [[02:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9753.16s)]
*  Do you do anything for your neck? [[02:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9755.16s)]
*  Like you do iron neck or anything? [[02:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9757.16s)]
*  I mean, God, my neck, I feel [[02:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9759.16s)]
*  like my posture's like a little fucked up, [[02:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9761.16s)]
*  so I've always had like really good guillotine defense [[02:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9763.16s)]
*  and shit, but I don't know, my neck [[02:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9765.16s)]
*  took a beating, but it feels pretty [[02:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9767.16s)]
*  strong and not too bad, but my back fucking [[02:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9769.16s)]
*  gets fucked up from wrestling a lot. [[02:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9771.16s)]
*  Do you ever do things specifically [[02:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9773.16s)]
*  to strengthen your neck? Not really, just [[02:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9775.16s)]
*  wrestle. Dude, get an iron neck. [[02:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9777.16s)]
*  We might have one here that will give you guys. [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9779.16s)]
*  This is the shit, greatest invention ever [[02:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9781.16s)]
*  for working out your neck. Really? [[02:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9783.16s)]
*  You ever use it? No. We have it here, I'll show it to you after the show. [[02:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9785.16s)]
*  Is that what keeps your posture so sharp? [[02:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9787.16s)]
*  Mine? Yeah. I'm just as cognizant [[02:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9789.16s)]
*  of it, because I have bad posture [[02:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9791.16s)]
*  all the time. But you just keep this fucking halo [[02:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9793.16s)]
*  on your head and it's got a bungee core [[02:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9795.16s)]
*  and you back up like this, it's like a [[02:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9797.16s)]
*  50 pound bungee cord, and then you do [[02:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9799.16s)]
*  this. Just do sets. [[02:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9801.16s)]
*  Fuck. [[02:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9803.16s)]
*  It's like a bull. That's it right there. [[02:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9805.16s)]
*  I'll show it to you guys, we have it in the gym. [[02:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9807.16s)]
*  Wrestling definitely, people [[02:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9809.16s)]
*  hanging on your neck though, if you're doing [[02:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9811.16s)]
*  fucking 5-6 rounds and you're [[02:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9813.16s)]
*  wrestling. Horrible. That's my favorite [[02:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9815.16s)]
*  practice, 100%, not even close to [[02:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9817.16s)]
*  anything else. Wrestling? Grappling, going live [[02:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9819.16s)]
*  from the feet. We have such good wrestlers at [[02:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9821.16s)]
*  our gym too. Why is that your favorite? [[02:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9823.16s)]
*  It's fucking exhausting. [[02:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9825.16s)]
*  I love hitting people [[02:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9827.16s)]
*  in takedowns. [[02:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9829.16s)]
*  It's almost like knocking someone out, not [[02:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9831.16s)]
*  quite as good, but you hit a little duck on somebody [[02:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9833.16s)]
*  and you score on them, it's fucking [[02:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9835.16s)]
*  fun. I feel good when I do that. [[02:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9837.16s)]
*  But yeah, [[02:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9839.16s)]
*  people hanging on your neck, especially when [[02:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9841.16s)]
*  you're going with college wrestlers, like [[02:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9843.16s)]
*  Bryce Meredith, when you fucking [[02:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9845.16s)]
*  snap your head down, you're fucking [[02:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9847.16s)]
*  trying to keep your posture up. Yeah, [[02:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9849.16s)]
*  3x D1 All-American, [[02:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9851.16s)]
*  2x NCAA finalist, they're [[02:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9853.16s)]
*  different level wrestlers. [[02:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9855.16s)]
*  It's fun going with those high ass level [[02:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9857.16s)]
*  wrestlers. It's humbling. [[02:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9859.16s)]
*  But yeah, that's my favorite practice. [[02:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9861.16s)]
*  Those are my favorites. You don't see wrestlers [[02:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9863.16s)]
*  going, well how old is Jordan Burroughs [[02:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9865.16s)]
*  actually? Because he's been wrestling at that [[02:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9867.16s)]
*  high level. He was like 36. [[02:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9869.16s)]
*  Is he really? Oh shit. And he's still at the top [[02:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9871.16s)]
*  of the food chain. Oh the freak. [[02:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9873.16s)]
*  How old is Jordan? 35. 35. [[02:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9875.16s)]
*  And to practice like that? [[02:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9877.16s)]
*  Wrestling's fucking brutal. [[02:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9879.16s)]
*  And 100% natural, because he's getting tested all the time. [[02:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9881.16s)]
*  Damn. That's impressive. [[02:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9883.16s)]
*  He wouldn't even drink one of these. I offered him a [[02:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9885.16s)]
*  CBD kill cliff, and he was like, [[02:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9887.16s)]
*  what's in there? I go CBD. [[02:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9889.16s)]
*  I don't think I can. [[02:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9891.16s)]
*  I might pop for something. [[02:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9893.16s)]
*  This? This is not going to make you pop [[02:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9895.16s)]
*  for anything. I can't take a chance. [[02:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9897.16s)]
*  The trickiest shit with that, what I've [[02:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9899.16s)]
*  learned from my experience is this one doesn't say it, [[02:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9901.16s)]
*  but if it said dietary supplement on the [[02:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9903.16s)]
*  back, or on the bottom, and if it [[02:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9905.16s)]
*  says supplemental [[02:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9907.16s)]
*  facts instead of nutrition facts, [[02:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9909.16s)]
*  that's when you can't take it unless [[02:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9911.16s)]
*  it's third party tested. So like a Celsius [[02:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9913.16s)]
*  says dietary supplement on the bottom, [[02:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9915.16s)]
*  and it doesn't say it's not third party tested. [[02:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9917.16s)]
*  So that, you could [[02:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9919.16s)]
*  test positive for that. [[02:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9921.16s)]
*  I guarantee you, if you drink kill cliffs. [[02:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9923.16s)]
*  Those ones are good. [[02:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9925.16s)]
*  It's just vitamins and minerals and [[02:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9927.16s)]
*  fucking... But certain drinks, [[02:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9929.16s)]
*  you gotta be so fucking careful. He grabbed [[02:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9931.16s)]
*  these gummies at the store the other day, [[02:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9933.16s)]
*  these veggie gummies, and he's like, [[02:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9935.16s)]
*  do you want one? I looked at the bag, and on the bottom it says dietary [[02:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9937.16s)]
*  supplement. And I can't have, [[02:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9939.16s)]
*  if you're in the U.S.O.D.A. pool, you cannot have [[02:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9941.16s)]
*  anything that says dietary supplement that is not [[02:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9943.16s)]
*  third party tested, because you could fucking test [[02:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9945.16s)]
*  for something. That makes sense. [[02:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9947.16s)]
*  Is it like a deal they have at the [[02:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9949.16s)]
*  U.S.O.D.A.? Is it like a certain year deal? [[02:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9951.16s)]
*  Or is it they just pay them yearly for it? [[02:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9953.16s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[02:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9955.16s)]
*  I'd pay them off. [[02:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9957.16s)]
*  Hey fellas, enough is enough. [[02:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9959.16s)]
*  I think we've proved our point. [[02:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9961.16s)]
*  It's crazy, some of the guys that got caught [[02:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9963.16s)]
*  weren't even from U.S.O.D.A. [[02:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9965.16s)]
*  TJ wasn't from U.S.O.D.A. I think it was an athletic commission. [[02:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9967.16s)]
*  But you know who I [[02:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9971.16s)]
*  can't wait to see climb up to is Bo'Nickel. [[02:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9973.16s)]
*  Bo'Nickel versus [[02:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9975.16s)]
*  Kamzot, Bo'Nickel versus [[02:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9977.16s)]
*  Paolo Costa, or Strickland. [[02:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9979.16s)]
*  Yeah man. [[02:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9981.16s)]
*  And he's got fucking hands, dude. [[02:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9983.16s)]
*  That's what's interesting, he's such an athlete. [[02:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9985.16s)]
*  He's that next [[02:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9987.16s)]
*  fucking breed. [[02:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9989.16s)]
*  Very interesting to watch [[02:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9991.16s)]
*  and see what happens with that guy. He's a big [[02:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9993.16s)]
*  yellow hunter. Big bow hunter, man. [[02:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9995.16s)]
*  Yeah, he seems like an interesting [[02:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9997.16s)]
*  dude. He seems like he's just doing everything right. [[02:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=9999.16s)]
*  He's living [[02:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10001.16s)]
*  like a champion. That's what I feel like I was doing before [[02:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10003.16s)]
*  all these guys. Before [[02:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10005.16s)]
*  when I was young in the UFC [[02:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10007.16s)]
*  I was living like a champion. [[02:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10009.16s)]
*  I was pretending I am a champ and I have to [[02:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10011.16s)]
*  defend the belt. And a lot of these guys [[02:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10013.16s)]
*  don't. A lot of them don't. What a crazy [[02:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10015.16s)]

*  the world who you were with fucking [[02:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10019.16s)]
*  Snoop Dogg and Yariah Faber [[02:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10021.16s)]
*  doing commentary. And really [[02:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10023.16s)]
*  there's no other opportunity [[02:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10025.16s)]
*  for that to happen because they don't even do that anymore. [[02:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10027.16s)]
*  Yeah, one season. I was on the first [[02:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10029.16s)]
*  season. They did it. Everyone, I mean [[02:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10031.16s)]
*  Snoop got a lot of hate and like for [[02:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10033.16s)]
*  that so I don't think they had them back [[02:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10035.16s)]
*  on again. But yeah, I lucked the fuck out. [[02:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10037.16s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10455.16s)]

*  It gets in your blood when we leave those around the [[02:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10459.16s)]
*  comedy club green room. [[02:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10461.16s)]
*  Like last night, everybody's hitting it. [[02:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10463.16s)]
*  I don't even mean to, it just happened. [[02:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10465.16s)]
*  Well, you see people do it, you're like I'm gonna try. [[02:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10467.16s)]
*  I wanna try. [[02:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10469.16s)]
*  I always wanted to try after seeing you guys hit it on the pod. [[02:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10471.16s)]
*  I'm like, god, I gotta rip them. [[02:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10473.16s)]
*  Are they allowed to do that in boxing anymore? [[02:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10475.16s)]
*  Because they used to do that. [[02:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10477.16s)]
*  In between rounds? [[02:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10479.16s)]
*  You get cracked and you're like [[02:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10481.16s)]
*  oh, I'm good. [[02:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10483.16s)]
*  I wonder if that'll do it. [[02:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10485.16s)]
*  I don't know if the commissions will allow it. [[02:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10487.16s)]
*  It's banned. [[02:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10489.16s)]
*  I wonder why, is it a performance enhancer? [[02:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10491.16s)]
*  Or is it just dangerous? [[02:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10493.16s)]
*  After Panama Lewis [[02:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10495.16s)]
*  gave Aaron Pryor [[02:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10497.16s)]
*  some unknown substance [[02:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10499.16s)]
*  in between rounds against Alexis Arguello, [[02:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10501.16s)]
*  Panama Lewis was like known for cheating. [[02:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10503.16s)]
*  He's like a [[02:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10505.16s)]
*  known bad guy. [[02:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10507.16s)]
*  He gave Aaron Pryor [[02:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10509.16s)]
*  this, he goes, give me another bottle. [[02:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10511.16s)]
*  No, the one I mixed. [[02:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10513.16s)]
*  And he gives it to him, and he gives it to Aaron Pryor who was [[02:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10515.16s)]
*  a known, he had known coke problems. [[02:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10517.16s)]
*  Improper use of smelling salts, [[02:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10519.16s)]
*  a growing concern among [[02:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10521.16s)]
*  look at that guy's eyes. [[02:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10523.16s)]
*  Did they find out what was in his drink? [[02:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10525.16s)]
*  80% of NFL players are [[02:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10527.16s)]
*  known to use it. 80%? [[02:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10529.16s)]
*  What's the problem? [[02:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10531.16s)]
*  I wonder what's like. [[02:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10533.16s)]
*  Oh, look at this shit. [[02:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10535.16s)]
*  Trauma patients often suffer neck injuries [[02:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10537.16s)]
*  that may be undetected. The first [[02:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10539.16s)]
*  response to a noxious smell to suddenly [[02:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10541.16s)]
*  jerk the head away from the stimulus [[02:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10543.16s)]
*  this can result in a dislocating [[02:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10545.16s)]
*  an injured spine and potential [[02:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10547.16s)]
*  paralysis. [[02:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10549.16s)]
*  I can see that. Shit. [[02:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10551.16s)]
*  I can see if you had a hurt neck. [[02:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10553.16s)]
*  But if you did have a hurt neck, like if you got KO'd in football [[02:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10555.16s)]
*  you got collashed and your head's [[02:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10557.16s)]
*  fucked up and they give you a smell, you start going [[02:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10559.16s)]
*  yeah, and you don't [[02:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10561.16s)]
*  realize your neck's jacked. [[02:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10563.16s)]
*  I can see that. But in other [[02:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10565.16s)]
*  circumstances. That's like 1% chance. [[02:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10567.16s)]
*  Yeah, like if you get dinged with an uppercut [[02:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10569.16s)]
*  and in between rounds they give you that [[02:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10571.16s)]
*  you're like, woo, woo. [[02:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10573.16s)]
*  They ban them from fighting because they can hide concussion symptoms. [[02:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10575.16s)]
*  I guess that is a benefit. [[02:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10577.16s)]
*  If you had been subjected up you wouldn't know you're fucked up. [[02:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10579.16s)]
*  That's what this says. It says [[02:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10581.16s)]
*  in the 70s they were eventually banned. I can see [[02:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10583.16s)]
*  that though. I kind of just fucking put you in the [[02:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10585.16s)]
*  But is it better to just [[02:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10587.16s)]
*  go out and still be concussed and [[02:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10589.16s)]
*  fight? Because people are always concussed [[02:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10591.16s)]
*  and fighting. That's a very good point. [[02:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10593.16s)]
*  Think about Snoop [[02:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10595.16s)]
*  think about [[02:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10597.16s)]
*  excuse me [[02:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10599.16s)]
*  how many times has a fighter been cracked [[02:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10601.16s)]
*  early in a fight [[02:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10603.16s)]
*  and then you see they're still dealing [[02:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10605.16s)]
*  with that later in the fight and then afterwards [[02:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10607.16s)]
*  they don't even remember the fight. Yeah, a lot. [[02:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10609.16s)]
*  That happens often times, right? [[02:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10611.16s)]
*  That person's concussed. [[02:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10613.16s)]
*  It happens all the time. Guys win fights [[02:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10615.16s)]
*  and they're concussed. [[02:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10617.16s)]
*  After the second round I was on autopilot [[02:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10619.16s)]
*  and I went back to my corner and I said what round is it? [[02:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10621.16s)]
*  They're like round five. I'm like what? [[02:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10623.16s)]
*  How is this round five? [[02:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10625.16s)]
*  Okay, Adesanya versus Strickland [[02:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10627.16s)]
*  that first round when he got [[02:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10629.16s)]
*  correct, high likelihood of concussion. [[02:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10631.16s)]
*  100% chance. [[02:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10633.16s)]
*  100% chance. I mean he got dropped [[02:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10635.16s)]
*  spun around and then [[02:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10637.16s)]
*  one, two, three, four [[02:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10639.16s)]
*  how many left hands did he hit him with? A lot. [[02:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10641.16s)]
*  Probably 20. Clean. At least. [[02:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10643.16s)]
*  A bunch were clean. You gotta [[02:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10645.16s)]
*  think he's dinged after that fight. [[02:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10647.16s)]
*  And you only said his arms felt [[02:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10649.16s)]
*  like rubber and how much of that was a factor? [[02:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10651.16s)]
*  Could it easily have been a factor [[02:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10653.16s)]
*  when they said it didn't look like him in there? [[02:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10655.16s)]
*  Maybe that's why. I mean it [[02:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10657.16s)]
*  easily could be from that. [[02:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10659.16s)]
*  Most likely. Especially because he shows [[02:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10661.16s)]
*  up every time. Yeah. [[02:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10663.16s)]
*  That fucking hits him right back. [[02:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10665.16s)]
*  And I'm back. [[02:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10667.16s)]
*  Yeah. You have to put [[02:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10669.16s)]
*  a little on your finger for the next fight. [[02:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10671.16s)]
*  Just in case. Yeah. [[02:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10673.16s)]
*  Just have someone. [[02:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10675.16s)]
*  I'm ready to do on it. [[02:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10677.16s)]
*  TB12. He's apparently known for doing it. [[02:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10679.16s)]
*  Oh really? I bet he is. [[02:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10681.16s)]
*  I bet he's known for doing every goddamn thing that works. [[02:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10683.16s)]
*  Yeah. I just listened to him on the PBD [[02:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10685.16s)]
*  pod. Oh he was on that? Yeah he was on that. [[02:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10687.16s)]
*  Interesting guy. But that was good. [[02:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10689.16s)]
*  He was playing at that high level for that long [[02:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10691.16s)]
*  and then just taking care of his body. [[02:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10693.16s)]
*  I like listening to that shit. You have to be [[02:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10695.16s)]
*  insanely smart. Yeah. To be a quarterback? [[02:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10697.16s)]
*  That's the craziest fucking [[02:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10699.16s)]
*  position in like all [[02:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10701.16s)]
*  sports. I feel like. Yeah. You have to know [[02:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10703.16s)]
*  so much about what's going on. I went to my first [[02:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10705.16s)]
*  NFL game two weeks ago. [[02:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10707.16s)]
*  Were you like in the suite or were you [[02:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10709.16s)]
*  going on the field? On the 50 yard line. [[02:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10711.16s)]
*  Like front row, 50 yard line. [[02:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10713.16s)]
*  Changes it when it's that close. Insane. [[02:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10715.16s)]
*  What'd you think of it? Insane. It was incredible. [[02:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10717.16s)]
*  It's so fun. It's so fun. [[02:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10719.16s)]
*  Can't watch it on TV. And then there's like 80,000 [[02:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10721.16s)]
*  people in there and everyone's going nuts when [[02:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10723.16s)]
*  they're cheering. And it's in Dallas and [[02:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10725.16s)]
*  the Cowboys are playing. Woo. [[02:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10727.16s)]
*  Those players just look like dinosaurs marching off the field. [[02:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10729.16s)]
*  Oh my god. These dudes are so [[02:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10731.16s)]
*  fucking huge. [[02:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10733.16s)]
*  They're so massive. Yeah. [[02:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10735.16s)]
*  You know. Which is kind of weird that the UFC has [[02:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10737.16s)]
*  a 265 pound weight limit. [[02:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10739.16s)]
*  Isn't it? Yeah. I feel like there's a [[02:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10741.16s)]
*  whole other ball game if you open [[02:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10743.16s)]
*  up that 265 plus. [[02:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10745.16s)]
*  Which is good. Right. A super heavyweight division. [[02:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10747.16s)]
*  But who would do it? [[02:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10749.16s)]
*  Because everyone is preparing to be 265. [[02:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10751.16s)]
*  Right? So like who [[02:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10753.16s)]
*  you would have to develop your [[02:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10755.16s)]
*  talent outside [[02:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10757.16s)]
*  where they have a super heavyweight division. [[02:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10759.16s)]
*  And I don't know of anybody that has one. [[02:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10761.16s)]
*  UFC could probably figure that out. [[02:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10763.16s)]
*  Does one FC have a weight limit on [[02:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10765.16s)]
*  their heavyweights? [[02:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10767.16s)]
*  I'm not even sure. That's a good question. [[02:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10769.16s)]
*  Google that, Jamie. Does one FC [[02:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10771.16s)]
*  have a 265 pound [[02:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10773.16s)]
*  weight limit? That was when I looked this up the other day. [[02:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10775.16s)]
*  I couldn't find the last super heavyweight fight was like [[02:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10777.16s)]
*  in 2018. Remember the Pride ones with [[02:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10779.16s)]
*  like that Du-Hyeong Choi, the [[02:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10781.16s)]
*  seven foot guy fighting Fador? [[02:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10783.16s)]
*  Oh yeah. When they'd have those super matches? [[02:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10785.16s)]
*  Yeah. They had crazy fights [[02:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10787.16s)]
*  over in Pride. I'm so glad there's weight classes. [[02:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10789.16s)]
*  Oh my god. That would not be [[02:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10791.16s)]
*  fun. UFC one. [[02:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10793.16s)]
*  Fuck. I would have been [[02:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10795.16s)]
*  fucked. If you have your skills [[02:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10797.16s)]
*  now though, you might not be fucked. [[02:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10799.16s)]
*  Way back then. It's 265 also. [[03:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10801.16s)]
*  That one FC is [[03:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10803.16s)]
*  265 also? That's such a weird [[03:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10805.16s)]
*  number. Is that a boxing thing or no? [[03:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10807.16s)]
*  No. Not at all. Wait, boxing doesn't have [[03:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10809.16s)]
*  the weight limit, right? Boxing doesn't have the weight limit. Tyson Fury [[03:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10811.16s)]
*  is like 280, 290 sometimes [[03:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10813.16s)]
*  in fights. Yeah. I feel [[03:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10815.16s)]
*  like I'm more excited for the [[03:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10817.16s)]
*  I'm excited for that fight. I feel like [[03:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10819.16s)]
*  I'm more excited for Dylan versus Logan [[03:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10821.16s)]
*  and KSI versus Tommy. [[03:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10823.16s)]
*  Are you really? I don't know why. I just keep [[03:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10825.16s)]
*  forgetting about, I feel like they're promoting it very [[03:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10827.16s)]
*  well. I'm seeing it all over. And then [[03:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10829.16s)]
*  I'm not really seeing Francis versus Tyson all over [[03:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10831.16s)]
*  as much as I'm seeing the other ones. That's [[03:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10833.16s)]
*  interesting. I'm not paying attention at all [[03:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10835.16s)]
*  to the Dylan versus Logan thing [[03:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10837.16s)]
*  other than the online drama occasionally. Yeah. [[03:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10839.16s)]
*  But I try to avoid all that stuff. [[03:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10841.16s)]
*  I don't want to be talking about his [[03:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10843.16s)]
*  stuff. His girlfriends. I know. [[03:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10845.16s)]
*  Where's the line? I'm getting a new [[03:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10847.16s)]
*  number. When I get my new number, I'm not putting any [[03:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10849.16s)]
*  apps on my phone. Smart. I'm going to keep this [[03:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10851.16s)]
*  phone and just have apps on that phone [[03:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10853.16s)]
*  and just every now and then when I have to post or [[03:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10855.16s)]
*  something like that, I'll post. But my new phone, [[03:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10857.16s)]
*  no apps. I just, it's [[03:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10859.16s)]
*  too much. Do you have a good time scrolling [[03:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10861.16s)]
*  on Instagram though? Seeing like bow hunting stuff? [[03:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10863.16s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. If I can [[03:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10865.16s)]
*  curate it correctly, but it's too late. [[03:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10867.16s)]
*  I follow like 5,000 people. [[03:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10869.16s)]
*  Because I'm, you know, if I [[03:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10871.16s)]
*  someone posts something I think is funny or something [[03:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10873.16s)]
*  I like, I go follow. It's not going to hurt me [[03:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10875.16s)]
*  to follow them. So I follow so [[03:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10877.16s)]
*  many people. And then the algorithm [[03:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10879.16s)]
*  recommends people that I don't follow [[03:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10881.16s)]
*  and things I don't follow. And so many of those [[03:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10883.16s)]
*  are murder. So many of those. [[03:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10885.16s)]
*  On Insta? Animal attacks. [[03:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10887.16s)]
*  Butt cheeks. Yeah, but that's [[03:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10889.16s)]
*  normal. You could find [[03:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10891.16s)]
*  sex online. I mean, that's [[03:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10893.16s)]
*  like one third of internet traffic. [[03:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10895.16s)]
*  If you seek it out. But in the [[03:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10897.16s)]
*  Instagram feed, when I'm not even looking, I'm seeing [[03:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10899.16s)]
*  people get killed by bulls. [[03:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10901.16s)]
*  Jesus. I don't see any of that [[03:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10903.16s)]
*  on mine. Bro, my algorithm's [[03:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10905.16s)]
*  a mess. It's all muscle [[03:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10907.16s)]
*  cars and people getting killed. [[03:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10909.16s)]
*  And people getting knocked unconscious. [[03:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10911.16s)]
*  How crazy is that fucking [[03:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10913.16s)]
*  ex-plad? Or just the plaid Tesla? [[03:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10915.16s)]
*  It's insane. Have you driven in it? [[03:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10917.16s)]
*  I got pulled over again. I have one. [[03:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10919.16s)]
*  Pulled over again. Literally [[03:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10921.16s)]
*  the exact, so right before I went to Boston, [[03:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10923.16s)]
*  a couple days before Boston, I got pulled over on [[03:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10925.16s)]
*  the highway and pulled in the same neighborhood. [[03:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10927.16s)]
*  And fucking right before I got here, [[03:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10929.16s)]
*  got pulled over, same highway, [[03:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10931.16s)]
*  same neighborhood, same cop. [[03:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10933.16s)]
*  I'm like, fuck! [[03:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10935.16s)]
*  So I gotta go deal with that when I get home. But those exes [[03:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10937.16s)]
*  are fucking insane. [[03:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10939.16s)]
*  They're so fast. They're so fast. [[03:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10941.16s)]
*  Even on the highway, you're going 90, it's just like, [[03:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10943.16s)]
*  feels like you're going 60. It makes no sound. [[03:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10945.16s)]
*  Yeah. And when you merge, you don't feel [[03:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10947.16s)]
*  like a douchebag. Because if I merge [[03:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10949.16s)]
*  in my Porsche, it's like, [[03:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10951.16s)]
*  Like I feel like a dickhead. [[03:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10953.16s)]
*  But I'm faster than that in the plaid. [[03:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10955.16s)]
*  No sound. Just [[03:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10957.16s)]
*  Yeah, we're out. [[03:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10959.16s)]
*  It's like defies time. [[03:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10961.16s)]
*  Yeah. It just, time [[03:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10963.16s)]
*  travels. It just, the way they move, [[03:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10965.16s)]
*  it's zero to 60 in 1.9 [[03:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10967.16s)]
*  seconds for a four-door [[03:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10969.16s)]
*  sedan. Stupid. [[03:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10971.16s)]
*  Bonkers. So stupid. [[03:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10973.16s)]
*  And wait until he comes out with that little one. I'm excited. [[03:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10975.16s)]
*  That little, the two-door? [[03:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10977.16s)]
*  The two-door, the roadster, [[03:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10979.16s)]
*  that thing's gonna be 1.5, [[03:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10981.16s)]
*  1.7, zero to 60. [[03:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10983.16s)]
*  Jesus. [[03:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10985.16s)]
*  And it's gonna handle, because all the weight's gonna be [[03:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10987.16s)]
*  at the bottom, because that's where the weight of the batteries is. [[03:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10989.16s)]
*  Jesus. [[03:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10991.16s)]
*  So it's like a beautiful center of gravity. [[03:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10993.16s)]
*  Those cars have a phenomenal center of gravity. [[03:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10995.16s)]
*  Yeah. I'm hoping I don't get my license suspended. [[03:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10997.16s)]
*  Are you worried? [[03:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=10999.16s)]
*  No, I feel like if I am, I'll just fucking [[03:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11001.16s)]
*  sell all my cars, get a Sprinter van, [[03:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11003.16s)]
*  and hire my dad to drive me around full-time. [[03:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11005.16s)]
*  So I'm not too worried about it. But, [[03:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11007.16s)]
*  I'd rather not. [[03:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11009.16s)]
*  How many tickets do you have? I've only got a couple, but [[03:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11011.16s)]
*  How many are from the Lamborghini? [[03:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11013.16s)]
*  None. Zero from the Lambo, [[03:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11015.16s)]
*  zero from, I got the new Corvette, [[03:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11017.16s)]
*  none from that. It's always in the Tesla. [[03:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11019.16s)]
*  Always in the fucking Tesla. Going on the highway going too fast. [[03:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11021.16s)]
*  It's just too easy to cruise in those. [[03:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11023.16s)]
*  It's like, I just don't feel like that's too fast. [[03:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11025.16s)]
*  Like, it's just not. [[03:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11027.16s)]
*  It's like a good speed. 90's okay. [[03:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11029.16s)]
*  It is in that thing. [[03:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11031.16s)]
*  I think for certain people, not for an old grandma, [[03:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11033.16s)]
*  but I'm fucking alert. I'm watching. [[03:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11035.16s)]
*  You're a pro athlete. Yeah, I should be able to go 90. [[03:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11037.16s)]
*  I'm talking, I'm gonna see what I can do about that. [[03:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11039.16s)]
*  I'm gonna talk to the sugar state athletic commission. [[03:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11041.16s)]
*  Why do they even make cars that go so fast [[03:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11043.16s)]
*  where it's illegal to drive anything? [[03:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11045.16s)]
*  Because it's kind of like they have to do it. [[03:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11047.16s)]
*  Why are they making computers? [[03:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11049.16s)]
*  Unless you're doing what Jamie does, or you're doing video editing [[03:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11051.16s)]
*  or something like that, or playing like insane computer games. [[03:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11053.16s)]
*  Why do you need that much processing power? [[03:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11055.16s)]
*  But every year the new one comes out, [[03:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11057.16s)]
*  you want the new thing. [[03:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11059.16s)]
*  When people look at zero to sixty numbers, [[03:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11061.16s)]
*  that's like a thing they all look at. [[03:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11063.16s)]
*  What is it? Yay, the new BMW N5. [[03:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11065.16s)]
*  Oh, zero to sixty and three point two. [[03:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11067.16s)]
*  Are you really going zero to sixty that fast? [[03:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11069.16s)]
*  Are you a fucking psycho? [[03:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11071.16s)]
*  Didn't they have a new electric Lucid or some shit [[03:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11073.16s)]
*  that's faster than the 1.9? [[03:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11075.16s)]
*  I don't believe so. I don't believe the Lucid is faster. [[03:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11077.16s)]
*  But there is a supercar that is faster than that. [[03:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11079.16s)]
*  It's an electric two million dollar supercar [[03:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11081.16s)]
*  that somebody makes that's fucking insane. [[03:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11085.16s)]
*  Jesus. The new electric Ferrari's look so sick. [[03:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11087.16s)]
*  The fastest thing that I've ever been in by far though [[03:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11089.16s)]
*  is John Hennessey's Venom. [[03:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11093.16s)]
*  John Hennessey, do you know who he is? [[03:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11095.16s)]
*  He's this psychotic Texas tuner guy [[03:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11097.16s)]
*  who takes like, I have a Ram. [[03:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11101.16s)]
*  I fucking love it. I have a Ram TRX. [[03:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11103.16s)]
*  Even a stock Ram TRX is the best truck I've ever driven. [[03:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11105.16s)]
*  They're fucking great. [[03:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11109.16s)]
*  It's comfortable. [[03:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11111.16s)]
*  It's got a very compliant suspension [[03:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11113.16s)]
*  and it's crazy off-road capable. [[03:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11115.16s)]
*  I mean those things you can Baja race in those motherfuckers. [[03:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11117.16s)]
*  And he takes that and he makes it a thousand horsepower. [[03:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11119.16s)]
*  It comes from the factory. It's seven hundred. [[03:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11123.16s)]
*  Seven something. [[03:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11125.16s)]
*  And he cranks it up to a thousand. [[03:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11127.16s)]
*  So it's a giant Ram truck that goes zero to sixty [[03:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11129.16s)]
*  in like three and a half seconds. [[03:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11133.16s)]
*  What's the Venom? [[03:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11135.16s)]
*  The Venom is his supercar. [[03:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11137.16s)]
*  It's all carbon fiber and it's two thousand horsepower. [[03:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11139.16s)]
*  That's what it's called a Venom? [[03:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11141.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11143.16s)]
*  What's the zero to sixty chain mean? [[03:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11145.16s)]
*  So it goes two hundred and fifty miles an hour. [[03:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11147.16s)]
*  It costs two and a half million dollars. [[03:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11151.16s)]
*  That's what it looked like that you went in? [[03:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11153.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11155.16s)]
*  You look at it and you just go oh my god. [[03:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11157.16s)]
*  Do they make any other cars? [[03:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11159.16s)]
*  He makes a bunch of shit. [[03:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11161.16s)]
*  But this is a totally made in factory car. [[03:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11163.16s)]
*  What he does with most stuff is tunes them. [[03:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11165.16s)]
*  This thing is so insane. [[03:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11167.16s)]
*  I mean it's beautiful. [[03:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11169.16s)]
*  And he took me for a ride in it. [[03:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11171.16s)]
*  I was terrified. [[03:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11173.16s)]
*  Faster than the plaids? [[03:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11175.16s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[03:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11177.16s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. A lot faster. [[03:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11179.16s)]
*  Is that a brick? [[03:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11181.16s)]
*  No. And it sounds like a demon. [[03:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11183.16s)]
*  That thing is fucking sexy. [[03:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11185.16s)]
*  It's so sexy. You've seen it in real life. [[03:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11187.16s)]
*  It's incredible. [[03:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11189.16s)]
*  It's incredible. [[03:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11191.16s)]
*  Jesus Christ. That's the fastest thing I've ever been in. [[03:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11193.16s)]
*  That thing is nuts. [[03:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11195.16s)]
*  It's literally like a race car. [[03:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11197.16s)]
*  You think about treating yourself to one? [[03:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11199.16s)]
*  Yeah, that's dangerous. [[03:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11201.16s)]
*  If I want to go fast I'll take the plaid. [[03:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11203.16s)]
*  And if I want to have fun I'll take a muscle car. [[03:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11205.16s)]
*  I like muscle cars. [[03:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11207.16s)]
*  Something about the sound. I never was a sound guy either. [[03:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11209.16s)]
*  But I do like the sound of it. [[03:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11211.16s)]
*  I'll let you drive one of mine. [[03:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11213.16s)]
*  One of the real ones. It's got a fully independent suspension. [[03:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11215.16s)]
*  You see this guy driving it on the Autobahn? [[03:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11219.16s)]
*  Yeah, the Tesla. [[03:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11221.16s)]
*  No way. [[03:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11223.16s)]
*  That's kilometers. [[03:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11225.16s)]
*  I was like, Jesus. [[03:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11227.16s)]
*  What's 260 kilometers? [[03:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11229.16s)]
*  I think he got it up to top speeds over 200 miles an hour. [[03:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11231.16s)]
*  Yeah, they're fast as fuck. [[03:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11233.16s)]
*  Holy fucking crap. [[03:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11235.16s)]
*  It gets to 60 that's so bonkers. [[03:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11237.16s)]
*  Yeah, I fucking love stepping on that. [[03:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11239.16s)]
*  My little princess too. [[03:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11241.16s)]
*  When she's in the back and I step on a little bit she goes, [[03:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11243.16s)]
*  ahhh. She loves it. She's faster. [[03:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11245.16s)]
*  I taught my 15 year old how to drive in that. [[03:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11247.16s)]
*  Really? [[03:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11249.16s)]
*  That's funny. [[03:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11251.16s)]
*  With it on Ludicrous mode? [[03:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11253.16s)]
*  It's always on Ludicrous mode. I never take it off. [[03:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11255.16s)]
*  But I taught her how to drive in that. [[03:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11257.16s)]
*  It's easy to control. [[03:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11259.16s)]
*  That's the difference between that and other high power cars. [[03:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11261.16s)]
*  You can drive in that very slowly, easily. [[03:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11263.16s)]
*  It's not hard to do. [[03:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11265.16s)]
*  It's the perfect car to drive around. [[03:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11267.16s)]
*  For a commuter car, it's the best car ever. [[03:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11269.16s)]
*  I take it more than anything. I love that car. [[03:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11271.16s)]
*  I'm always taking that. Or I take the Ram. [[03:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11273.16s)]
*  It's weird when you drive the Tesla's too with the [[03:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11275.16s)]
*  regenerative braking and getting a different car. [[03:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11277.16s)]
*  It's like, what the fuck? [[03:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11279.16s)]
*  You're used to just driving with one pedal. [[03:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11281.16s)]
*  Letting it slow itself down. [[03:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11283.16s)]
*  Or if you're on cruise control on a different car [[03:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11285.16s)]
*  and you forget that it doesn't slow down when you get behind someone [[03:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11287.16s)]
*  you fucking don't say no. [[03:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11289.16s)]
*  When you hit that, and it stays in the lane. [[03:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11291.16s)]
*  That's so nice. [[03:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11293.16s)]
*  I need to use it fucking more because apparently... [[03:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11295.16s)]
*  So how many tickets have you gotten? [[03:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11299.16s)]
*  Just like two within the last couple of months. [[03:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11301.16s)]
*  But this motherfucker got three within like... [[03:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11303.16s)]
*  No, that last one you didn't get a ticket because the cop knew you. [[03:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11305.16s)]
*  But this motherfucker was just in the same position I was in. [[03:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11307.16s)]
*  You had to go to court and everything too. [[03:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11311.16s)]
*  I had to go. [[03:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11313.16s)]
*  Just the Model 3. [[03:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11315.16s)]
*  Tesla, yeah. [[03:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11317.16s)]
*  I love it. [[03:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11319.16s)]
*  I love the car for the value. [[03:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11321.16s)]
*  Oh my god. [[03:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11323.16s)]
*  I was at a red light and I was in my G3RS [[03:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11325.16s)]
*  which sounds fucking insane. [[03:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11327.16s)]
*  And this Model 3 just went... [[03:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11329.16s)]
*  Took off ahead of me. [[03:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11331.16s)]
*  I was like, I'm not even going to try. [[03:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11333.16s)]
*  You motherfucker. [[03:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11335.16s)]
*  Silently. [[03:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11337.16s)]
*  Kind of an economy car. [[03:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11339.16s)]
*  For the price, those things are fucking... [[03:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11343.16s)]
*  Incredible. [[03:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11345.16s)]
*  And if you have a charger at your house, it's the shit. [[03:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11347.16s)]
*  You just plug it into your house. [[03:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11351.16s)]
*  You never have to go to the gas station. [[03:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11353.16s)]
*  You know those sketchy moments where you're coming home [[03:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11355.16s)]
*  and it's one o'clock in the morning and you're on E. [[03:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11357.16s)]
*  Like fuck. [[03:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11359.16s)]
*  I want to get gas. [[03:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11361.16s)]
*  But I don't want to fucking pull into some weird station [[03:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11363.16s)]
*  and get car jacked. [[03:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11365.16s)]
*  Yeah, you see too many videos. [[03:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11367.16s)]
*  Especially in a busy city, the Hovelane, [[03:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11369.16s)]
*  when you can just click that self-drive and it sits back. [[03:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11371.16s)]
*  Have a jack. [[03:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11373.16s)]
*  You've seen people falling asleep in those things in traffic. [[03:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11375.16s)]
*  They're asleep in the car. [[03:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11377.16s)]
*  Yeah, that's fucking terrifying. [[03:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11379.16s)]
*  I couldn't do that. [[03:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11381.16s)]
*  But those motherfuckers probably worked for ten hours. [[03:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11383.16s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of silicone valley people [[03:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11385.16s)]
*  on their last edge. [[03:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11387.16s)]
*  Last fucking... [[03:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11389.16s)]
*  Ran out of Adderalls. [[03:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11391.16s)]
*  We still haven't been to a Buc-ee's. [[03:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11393.16s)]
*  We keep hearing about Buc-ee's. [[03:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11395.16s)]
*  Oh, I talked about it last night. You gotta go. [[03:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11397.16s)]
*  We went to H-E-B thinking it's Buc-ee's. [[03:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11399.16s)]
*  H-E-B's gonna be sweet. [[03:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11401.16s)]
*  I didn't think it was gonna be a Buc-ee's. [[03:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11403.16s)]
*  I knew the difference. But you keep hearing about H-E-B. [[03:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11405.16s)]
*  I'm like, I gotta go. [[03:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11407.16s)]
*  We go and I'm like, what the fuck? [[03:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11409.16s)]
*  We thought it was a Whole Foods. [[03:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11411.16s)]
*  We thought it was a nice organic Whole Foods or some shit. [[03:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11413.16s)]
*  No. [[03:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11415.16s)]
*  We gotta go to Whole Foods. [[03:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11417.16s)]
*  There's a place called Central Market that's actually better than Whole Foods. [[03:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11419.16s)]
*  Central Market's great. [[03:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11421.16s)]
*  But it's also an advanced Whole Foods. [[03:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11423.16s)]
*  It's like Whole Foods but even better. [[03:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11425.16s)]
*  It's great. [[03:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11427.16s)]
*  But H-E-B's is a good, nice supermarket. [[03:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11429.16s)]
*  But Buc-ee's is an experience. [[03:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11431.16s)]
*  You can buy tents at Buc-ee's. [[03:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11433.16s)]
*  You can buy tents at Buc-ee's. [[03:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11435.16s)]
*  Fishing equipment. [[03:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11437.16s)]
*  Buc-ee's is nuts. [[03:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11439.16s)]
*  It's so big. [[03:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11441.16s)]
*  You're talking about hundreds of pumps. [[03:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11443.16s)]
*  You sit there and you're like, what is going on? [[03:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11445.16s)]
*  It's like a parking lot filled with pumps. [[03:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11447.16s)]
*  That's badass. [[03:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11449.16s)]
*  Yeah, it makes sense. [[03:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11451.16s)]
*  It's just Texas. [[03:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11453.16s)]
*  You usually do Instacart or you go shopping? [[03:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11455.16s)]
*  Or your wife? [[03:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11457.16s)]
*  Like when you get groceries and stuff? [[03:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11459.16s)]
*  What's Instacart? [[03:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11461.16s)]
*  You can just go to whatever store, click it in your thing, and they'll deliver it right to your door. [[03:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11463.16s)]
*  Nah, go shopping. [[03:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11467.16s)]
*  Just push a fucking cart around and say hi to people. [[03:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11469.16s)]
*  Is it constantly pictures? [[03:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11471.16s)]
*  Or do people kind of leave a little bit alone? [[03:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11473.16s)]
*  Mostly they leave me alone. [[03:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11475.16s)]
*  People out here are cool, man. [[03:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11477.16s)]
*  They're friendly. [[03:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11479.16s)]
*  It doesn't feel douchey. [[03:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11481.16s)]
*  They're just folks. [[03:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11483.16s)]
*  Shopping. [[03:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11485.16s)]
*  Fans too, listening to the pod. [[03:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11487.16s)]
*  Most people are just nice. [[03:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11489.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11491.16s)]
*  It's nice. [[03:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11493.16s)]
*  That's how I feel like it is out kind of in Arizona where we're at. [[03:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11495.16s)]
*  But one thing does happen to people, [[03:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11497.16s)]
*  and it's going to happen to you too, [[03:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11499.16s)]
*  is as you get more and more famous, [[03:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11501.16s)]
*  sometimes people get anxiety about social circumstances [[03:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11503.16s)]
*  just because you don't want to get bothered. [[03:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11505.16s)]
*  I've felt that before. [[03:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11507.16s)]
*  Where I'm like, I want to go take a pee at a restaurant, [[03:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11509.16s)]
*  I don't really want to walk past people [[03:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11511.16s)]
*  and then go in the bathroom and something there. [[03:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11513.16s)]
*  Especially you, because you're so identifiable. [[03:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11515.16s)]
*  That's true. [[03:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11517.16s)]
*  Then I try to go incognito [[03:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11519.16s)]
*  and I have a sugar hat [[03:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11521.16s)]
*  with a sugar shirt and sugar shorts. [[03:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11523.16s)]
*  I'm like, that didn't work. [[03:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11525.16s)]
*  My hair is fucking pink. [[03:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11527.16s)]
*  All your cars are flashing colors. [[03:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11529.16s)]
*  Come on, man. You're a star. [[03:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11531.16s)]
*  That's how you got to do it. [[03:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11533.16s)]
*  How did you pick that song that you came out to? [[03:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11535.16s)]
*  It was the perfect song. [[03:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11537.16s)]
*  It's funny. [[03:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11539.16s)]
*  I listened to that song for a long time. [[03:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11541.16s)]
*  But I played it in Abu Dhabi. [[03:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11543.16s)]
*  I knew it wouldn't be a banger in Abu Dhabi [[03:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11545.16s)]
*  because I was a fan of the pay-per-view. [[03:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11547.16s)]
*  I knew it wasn't going to be too good. [[03:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11549.16s)]
*  But for me, I was like, this is my moment. [[03:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11551.16s)]
*  I'm going to walk out to it. [[03:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11553.16s)]
*  I actually walked out to it too [[03:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11555.16s)]
*  when I fought Jose Quinones. [[03:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11557.16s)]
*  After I broke my foot when I came back, [[03:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11559.16s)]
*  I walked out to it in Vegas at T-Mobile. [[03:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11561.16s)]
*  Now I went away from it for a little bit, [[03:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11563.16s)]
*  but I knew that was going to fucking just... [[03:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11565.16s)]
*  You got a song in mind for the rematch with Cheeto? [[03:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11567.16s)]
*  I do have a different song in mind, [[03:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11569.16s)]
*  but I also might stick with Superstar. [[03:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11571.16s)]
*  It's a good one, man. [[03:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11573.16s)]
*  It's a good one. [[03:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11575.16s)]
*  There's a thing that happens with certain fighters [[03:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11577.16s)]
*  where when they play a song, [[03:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11579.16s)]
*  people get used to it. [[03:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11581.16s)]
*  When Uriah Faber used to come out to... [[03:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11583.16s)]
*  Oh yeah, Jose Aldo. [[03:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11585.16s)]
*  Chris Wideman. [[03:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11587.16s)]
*  Yeah, there's a thing with fighters [[03:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11589.16s)]
*  with a song. [[03:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11591.16s)]
*  With Anderson Silva. [[03:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11593.16s)]
*  He walked out of that. [[03:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11595.16s)]
*  He did? [[03:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11597.16s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[03:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11599.16s)]
*  When John Jones comes out, [[03:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11601.16s)]
*  yeah, [[03:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11603.16s)]
*  that's a good one. [[03:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11605.16s)]
*  Matt Hughes' song. [[03:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11607.16s)]
*  That was the greatest one. [[03:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11609.16s)]
*  That was the greatest one. [[03:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11611.16s)]
*  At the time, when Matt was the fucking man, [[03:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11613.16s)]
*  and he would come out to that song, [[03:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11615.16s)]
*  it's what's a great opening line to [[03:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11617.16s)]
*  The Preacher Man Says Is the End of Time. [[03:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11619.16s)]
*  Yeah, the walkouts, [[03:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11623.16s)]
*  being there, [[03:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11625.16s)]
*  being at a UFC fight, [[03:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11627.16s)]
*  there's just something about those walkouts, dude. [[03:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11629.16s)]
*  Just looking right at that tunnel waiting. [[03:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11631.16s)]
*  It's so weird because [[03:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11633.16s)]
*  it's the most calm I ever am [[03:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11635.16s)]
*  in my life, [[03:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11637.16s)]
*  in that moment, before we walk. [[03:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11639.16s)]
*  Even in the back. [[03:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11641.16s)]
*  I'm just calm. [[03:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11643.16s)]
*  And you know what's really cool is the documentary crew [[03:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11645.16s)]
*  is following me around this last fight. [[03:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11647.16s)]
*  UFC's putting out a really, really cool [[03:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11649.16s)]
*  documentary next year. [[03:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11651.16s)]
*  And they were following me around, [[03:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11653.16s)]
*  but they had all the access in the back. [[03:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11655.16s)]
*  But yeah, [[03:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11657.16s)]
*  I can feel so calm. [[03:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11659.16s)]
*  You think that's from the meditation? [[03:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11661.16s)]
*  I think it's definitely [[03:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11663.16s)]
*  I've learned how to get into that [[03:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11665.16s)]
*  state of mind, but I also know that [[03:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11667.16s)]
*  that's just where I perform the best at. [[03:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11669.16s)]
*  I'm very calm. [[03:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11671.16s)]
*  Do you ever feel yourself getting [[03:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11673.16s)]
*  hyped up or ramped up, and then you just [[03:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11675.16s)]
*  go slow down? [[03:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11677.16s)]
*  No. [[03:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11679.16s)]
*  It's all calm. Just calm. [[03:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11681.16s)]
*  The whole fight week, I feel very calm. [[03:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11683.16s)]
*  Fight day, I feel very calm. [[03:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11685.16s)]
*  I feel very calm. And sometimes I'm like [[03:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11687.16s)]
*  I just, fuck, I don't know. [[03:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11691.16s)]
*  It's weird. I have a conversation with myself [[03:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11693.16s)]
*  to where I kind of, with my breath, [[03:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11695.16s)]
*  I'm going to say, alright, I'm just going to let my [[03:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11697.16s)]
*  higher self take over. All the work was put in. [[03:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11699.16s)]
*  I'm going to [[03:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11701.16s)]
*  just surrender to this moment, let the [[03:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11703.16s)]
*  higher self take over. And I feel like [[03:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11705.16s)]
*  I've kind of, I don't want to say mastered that [[03:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11707.16s)]
*  because, you know, [[03:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11709.16s)]
*  I feel like there's always work to do, but I feel like I've [[03:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11711.16s)]
*  gotten, I've been able to do it pretty much every [[03:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11713.16s)]
*  single UFC fight. I've been able to go in there [[03:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11715.16s)]
*  and just flow. Whatever happens happens. [[03:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11717.16s)]
*  I completely accept [[03:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11719.16s)]
*  that even if I go out there and lose, that [[03:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11721.16s)]
*  my life is still good. You know, I still have [[03:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11723.16s)]
*  my princess, still have my family, still have my [[03:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11725.16s)]
*  friends. Life's okay. And I feel like [[03:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11727.16s)]
*  I accept that 100%. [[03:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11729.16s)]
*  I also haven't had to deal [[03:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11731.16s)]
*  with a loss. A loss [[03:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11733.16s)]
*  that's, you know, so I, we'll see [[03:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11735.16s)]
*  if it ever happens, but... [[03:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11737.16s)]
*  That's why it's always impressive with people like [[03:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11739.16s)]
*  biss being after Hendo knocked him out to come back [[03:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11741.16s)]
*  and become the champion. Oh yeah. [[03:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11743.16s)]
*  And to do it with one eye. [[03:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11745.16s)]
*  That's insane. [[03:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11747.16s)]
*  The guy fought ten fights, including [[03:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11749.16s)]
*  winning the world title with one eye. [[03:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11751.16s)]
*  That was one of my favorite moments in the UFC. [[03:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11753.16s)]
*  I didn't watch the UFC very [[03:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11755.16s)]
*  too far back, but one of the coolest [[03:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11757.16s)]
*  moments was when biss being knocked out rock cold. [[03:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11759.16s)]
*  It was incredible. It was fucking insane. [[03:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11761.16s)]
*  It just shows you this sport, you can't [[03:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11763.16s)]
*  take anything for granted. I'm fucking laughing. [[03:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11765.16s)]
*  You can't take anybody for granted. [[03:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11767.16s)]
*  You can't be overconfident. [[03:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11769.16s)]
*  You can't sleep on people. [[03:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11771.16s)]
*  You can't, anything can happen. [[03:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11773.16s)]
*  Luke was the definition of [[03:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11775.16s)]
*  overconfident going into that fight, I feel like. [[03:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11777.16s)]
*  This is his fucking demeanor [[03:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11779.16s)]
*  and he's just like... [[03:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11781.16s)]
*  Everything. Yeah. I mean, and [[03:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11783.16s)]
*  you know, justifiably so. [[03:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11785.16s)]
*  Just smoke Chris Weidman looked like the fucking [[03:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11787.16s)]
*  man. Everybody's like, Jesus [[03:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11789.16s)]
*  Christ, this guy's a stone cold killer. [[03:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11791.16s)]
*  Smoked biss being after a full fight camp. [[03:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11793.16s)]
*  Now he's fighting him on two weeks. [[03:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11795.16s)]
*  Remember he hit him with that question mark kick? [[03:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11797.16s)]
*  And then guillotined him. [[03:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11799.16s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[03:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11801.16s)]
*  That was bad. Luke Rockhold's a fucking savage. [[03:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11803.16s)]
*  He was a fucking savage. [[03:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11805.16s)]
*  And then Mike Perry all pieced him like that. [[03:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11807.16s)]
*  And the bare knuckle, that was crazy. I was excited for that. [[03:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11809.16s)]
*  That was exciting. [[03:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11811.16s)]
*  Mike Perry's just uniquely qualified [[03:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11813.16s)]
*  to fight in that shit. He's built for that. [[03:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11815.16s)]
*  He's designed for it. [[03:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11817.16s)]
*  And he's kind of fighting them motherfuckers. [[03:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11819.16s)]
*  Even his grappling was underrated. He could fucking [[03:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11821.16s)]
*  grapple. He's strong as shit. [[03:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11823.16s)]
*  And he's so game. [[03:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11825.16s)]
*  His mindset is such an important quality. [[03:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11827.16s)]
*  And his mindset is a [[03:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11829.16s)]
*  Rottweiler. [[03:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11831.16s)]
*  He's just a savage. [[03:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11833.16s)]
*  I remember bare knuckle kind of [[03:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11835.16s)]
*  blew up a little bit for a second. But I haven't heard [[03:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11837.16s)]
*  anything. Have they not had another big event yet? [[03:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11839.16s)]
*  They're gonna have [[03:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11841.16s)]
*  Look, Jorge [[03:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11843.16s)]
*  Mausodal's doing bare knuckle MMA. [[03:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11845.16s)]
*  I like that a lot. Have you [[03:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11847.16s)]
*  ever thought about doing that? I would never. [[03:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11849.16s)]
*  I like fucking [[03:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11851.16s)]
*  that little bit of padding I got for that, baby. [[03:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11853.16s)]
*  I feel like I got pretty strong hands, though. [[03:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11855.16s)]
*  Pretty big hands, strong hands. [[03:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11857.16s)]
*  But I'd rather not. [[03:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11859.16s)]
*  They'll break. Yeah, I'd rather not. [[03:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11861.16s)]
*  I think what they're doing with the wrap too [[03:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11863.16s)]
*  is odd. You wrap the hand up and the wrist [[03:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11865.16s)]
*  up, but you leave the knuckles. [[03:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11867.16s)]
*  One of the vulnerabilities of the hand is not just [[03:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11869.16s)]
*  the fact that the hands are brittle, but the fact that [[03:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11871.16s)]
*  when you punch something, [[03:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11873.16s)]
*  your hand is not [[03:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11875.16s)]
*  really designed to [[03:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11877.16s)]
*  be good. You're hitting [[03:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11879.16s)]
*  accurate, too. [[03:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11881.16s)]
*  And if this happens, [[03:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11883.16s)]
*  I fucked my wrist up once when I [[03:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11885.16s)]
*  was young, when I didn't tape it right, and I [[03:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11887.16s)]
*  hit someone with a body shot and I caught their elbow [[03:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11889.16s)]
*  and twisted my wrist back. My wrist was fucked [[03:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11891.16s)]
*  up for like a year after that. [[03:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11893.16s)]
*  You blew your bicep out during a [[03:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11895.16s)]
*  body shot like that. Boom. I watched [[03:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11897.16s)]
*  it. I was filming. He was sparring. [[03:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11899.16s)]
*  He had a fight coming up. I was filming his [[03:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11901.16s)]
*  rounds. He threw a body shot at this guy [[03:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11903.16s)]
*  and I fucking watched his bicep go up [[03:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11905.16s)]
*  through his arm. It was so gross. [[03:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11907.16s)]
*  Did you get it reattached? [[03:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11909.16s)]
*  Yeah. Both of them? Yeah, both. [[03:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11911.16s)]
*  Oh, both of them went out? Both of them. [[03:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11913.16s)]
*  And his brothers. It's like a crazy [[03:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11915.16s)]
*  jeez. It is weird. [[03:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11917.16s)]
*  Matt Serra did that and never got it fixed. [[03:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11919.16s)]
*  So when he makes one bicep, [[03:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11921.16s)]
*  it's like in the middle of it, [[03:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11923.16s)]
*  it pops up. It's like he's missing the [[03:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11925.16s)]
*  front part of the bicep, like up to here. [[03:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11927.16s)]
*  That dude's a character. Oh, he's so funny. [[03:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11929.16s)]
*  That fucker is funny. He's so funny. [[03:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11931.16s)]
*  I like watching him on certain things. He's a fucking [[03:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11933.16s)]
*  wild man. He's great on podcasts. [[03:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11935.16s)]
*  We did this podcast with my friend [[03:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11937.16s)]
*  John Rollo, Dean Thomas and him. [[03:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11939.16s)]
*  It was amazing. He's [[03:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11941.16s)]
*  so funny. His stories and [[03:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11943.16s)]
*  just his energy and his character. Yeah, he's [[03:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11945.16s)]
*  funny motherfucker. He's the classic New York funny [[03:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11947.16s)]
*  Italian guy. [[03:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11949.16s)]
*  And an [[03:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11951.16s)]
*  amazing jujitsu guy. God damn [[03:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11953.16s)]
*  was he good when he was young. Really? [[03:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11955.16s)]
*  Matt Serra was the [[03:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11957.16s)]
*  fucking man. He's a world [[03:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11959.16s)]
*  championship caliber, like as elite as [[03:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11961.16s)]
*  anybody. Did he do gi too or just no gi? [[03:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11963.16s)]
*  Gi and no gi. He did everything. Yeah. [[03:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11965.16s)]
*  He's a fucking assasin, like a super high level [[03:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11967.16s)]
*  black belt. [[03:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11969.16s)]
*  That's where Aljoe, those guys train [[03:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11971.16s)]
*  out of, right? Fucking under him. [[03:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11973.16s)]
*  That whole Enzo Gracie lineage, one of the greatest [[03:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11975.16s)]
*  lineages in jujitsu. [[03:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11977.16s)]
*  Think about who came from there. The John [[03:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11979.16s)]
*  Donahair, Gordon Ryan, all those guys. [[03:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11981.16s)]
*  They all came out of that one camp. [[03:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11983.16s)]
*  Gary Tonan. [[03:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11985.16s)]
*  Even Craig Jones. Craig Jones came over. [[03:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11987.16s)]
*  It's like so many elite guys [[03:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11989.16s)]
*  came out of that one camp. I wonder what Krohn's going to do. [[03:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11991.16s)]
*  I wonder if he's like, fucking, I'm done. [[03:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11993.16s)]
*  That last fight was a bummer. That was great. [[03:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11995.16s)]
*  We were there live and it was just, yeah. Charles [[03:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11997.16s)]
*  Jordan though, I mean, he had a good game plan. [[03:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=11999.16s)]
*  Good fucking execution. [[03:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12001.16s)]
*  I wonder if that Krohn's just so like [[03:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12003.16s)]
*  stuck in his ways a little bit. Cause we were going to visit [[03:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12005.16s)]
*  Montana, hit him up to maybe get some training [[03:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12007.16s)]
*  in with him for Sugar and I. Didn't [[03:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12009.16s)]
*  hit us back. They say he just stays in the mountains. [[03:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12011.16s)]
*  Just trains [[03:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12013.16s)]
*  when he feels like it. [[03:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12015.16s)]
*  And it looked like that. Gotta be crazy. [[03:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12017.16s)]
*  Those guys are your family though. It's like how much [[03:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12019.16s)]
*  pressure is on you to be great. [[03:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12021.16s)]
*  But it's also in this world [[03:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12023.16s)]
*  of today, [[03:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12025.16s)]
*  just Jiu Jitsu is not enough. It might [[03:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12027.16s)]
*  be enough like if you catch Alex Koceras [[03:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12029.16s)]
*  like he did. You know, and you get his back. [[03:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12031.16s)]
*  I mean, if Krohn gets on you. Yeah, [[03:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12033.16s)]
*  you're fucked. You're fucked. [[03:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12035.16s)]
*  It's Jiu Jitsu at the highest level. But he's gotta get on [[03:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12037.16s)]
*  top. Because he was [[03:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12039.16s)]
*  on his bottom against Charles. [[03:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12041.16s)]
*  And Charles did a good job keeping his [[03:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12043.16s)]
*  hips squared. Charles [[03:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12045.16s)]
*  is a real black belt as well. That's the thing. [[03:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12047.16s)]
*  Charles is very high level on the ground. And he's [[03:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12049.16s)]
*  so skillful. He just subbed Ricardo [[03:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12051.16s)]
*  Lamos, didn't he? I didn't see that. I heard [[03:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12053.16s)]
*  that though. That's fucking impressive. [[03:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12055.16s)]
*  Yeah, he's legit. He's super. [[03:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12057.16s)]
*  Charles Jiu Jitsu is super legit. Super [[03:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12059.16s)]
*  technical. Very well rounded. [[03:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12061.16s)]
*  Can do everything. For 45 division. [[03:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12063.16s)]
*  In this day and age too, just like [[03:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12065.16s)]
*  it's gonna be hard to just be dangerous off [[03:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12067.16s)]
*  your back and the guard. Everyone's [[03:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12069.16s)]
*  just so fucking good at Jiu Jitsu now. There's [[03:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12071.16s)]
*  so many world champions you can find and feel [[03:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12073.16s)]
*  them. So to have a good [[03:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12075.16s)]
*  guard, I mean fuck. The scariest guy [[03:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12077.16s)]
*  off his back today in the UFC is Paul Craig. [[03:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12079.16s)]
*  Paul Craig [[03:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12081.16s)]
*  catches people with triangles with like one [[03:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12083.16s)]
*  second to go. Magomedov, he got him like one [[03:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12085.16s)]
*  second to go and fight his losing. [[03:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12087.16s)]
*  Charles Oliveira too gets that overload. [[03:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12089.16s)]
*  Fucking butchering. [[03:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12091.16s)]
*  Oliveira's nasty. I'm excited for that. [[03:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12093.16s)]
*  October, Abu Dhabi, [[03:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12095.16s)]
*  Charles Islam too, Paulo [[03:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12097.16s)]
*  versus Hamza. [[03:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12099.16s)]
*  I wish it was, I mean [[03:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12101.16s)]
*  if it was here I'd go. But fucking [[03:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12103.16s)]
*  Abu Dhabi has a flight. That's a long [[03:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12105.16s)]
*  ass flight. But I would love to see [[03:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12107.16s)]
*  Charles fucking win. That would [[03:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12109.16s)]
*  make for a huge trilogy. It [[03:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12111.16s)]
*  would be. Maybe call Khabib out. No, there's [[03:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12113.16s)]
*  no shot. That's not gonna happen. [[03:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12115.16s)]
*  But it's also, it's like you kind of see vulnerability [[03:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12117.16s)]
*  in Islam after that fight with [[03:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12119.16s)]
*  Volkanovsky. First of all you see how good Volkanovsky [[03:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12121.16s)]
*  really is. Pound for pound. Fucking [[03:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12123.16s)]
*  animal. Yeah. He's number one. [[03:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12125.16s)]
*  You have to say, they have him not [[03:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12127.16s)]
*  listed as pound for pound because he lost that fight. [[03:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12129.16s)]
*  I think you make a real argument that he won [[03:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12131.16s)]
*  that fight. On top and the end of the fifth [[03:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12133.16s)]
*  pounding on him is hard not to. I mean. I think he won [[03:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12135.16s)]
*  the fight. In my mind he won [[03:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12137.16s)]
*  the fight. I think he did more damage. I think [[03:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12139.16s)]
*  he opposed his skill set. It's also insanely [[03:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12141.16s)]
*  impressive that he goes up from 45 to fight a [[03:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12143.16s)]
*  massive 55. [[03:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12145.16s)]
*  The guy is as big at 55 as anybody [[03:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12147.16s)]
*  is. And you know at the end of the fight [[03:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12149.16s)]
*  he's on top beating him up. He drops him, gets [[03:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12151.16s)]
*  on top of him. I mean and had [[03:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12153.16s)]
*  massive moments throughout the [[03:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12155.16s)]
*  fight. But it sort of [[03:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12157.16s)]
*  at least gives an air of vulnerability [[03:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12159.16s)]
*  to Islam where before that most people [[03:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12161.16s)]
*  were like this guy's unstoppable. Oh fuck. [[03:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12163.16s)]
*  Charles got to see some confidence from that. [[03:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12165.16s)]
*  I get some. But then again [[03:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12167.16s)]
*  Islam just smushed him when he got on top of him. [[03:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12169.16s)]
*  I mean he didn't even just most people walk [[03:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12171.16s)]
*  into Charles' full guard. He forced [[03:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12173.16s)]
*  the half guard right away. Pinched his [[03:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12175.16s)]
*  knees, forced the half guard. Like what a good ass idea. [[03:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12177.16s)]
*  He also rocked him, dropped him, [[03:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12179.16s)]
*  boom. That too. Yeah that too. [[03:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12181.16s)]
*  Yeah there's a lot of factors. [[03:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12183.16s)]
*  But looking at Charles versus Benil [[03:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12185.16s)]
*  Darius she's like he's back. [[03:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12187.16s)]
*  That was sick. He's such, and he's [[03:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12189.16s)]
*  such an interesting case right. Because at one [[03:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12191.16s)]
*  point in time like the Cubs Swanson fight [[03:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12193.16s)]
*  and a couple of his other fights people are like well [[03:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12195.16s)]
*  Charles just doesn't have it. Like whatever it is [[03:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12197.16s)]
*  he just falls apart. [[03:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12199.16s)]
*  Then he has a kid. He has a daughter. [[03:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12201.16s)]
*  Is that what it was? Yeah man. I can [[03:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12203.16s)]
*  see that. And then. Well he went [[03:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12205.16s)]
*  up to 55 too right? That too. That's gotta be. [[03:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12207.16s)]
*  Yeah that too. The 45 was real [[03:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12209.16s)]
*  bad on him. It was real bad on him. It was just [[03:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12211.16s)]
*  rough. But he did 55 before. [[03:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12213.16s)]
*  I think he did 55 in the initial [[03:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12215.16s)]
*  fights in the UFC. [[03:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12217.16s)]
*  But against Efrain Escudero I think [[03:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12219.16s)]
*  I think that was 55. [[03:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12221.16s)]
*  But he [[03:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12223.16s)]
*  was just too dehydrated [[03:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12225.16s)]
*  and fucked up to fight at 45. [[03:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12227.16s)]
*  For whatever reason just didn't have it together mentally. [[03:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12229.16s)]
*  And then boom. [[03:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12231.16s)]
*  All of a sudden he's the fucking man. [[03:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12233.16s)]
*  Yeah it's almost just so cool [[03:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12235.16s)]
*  seeing those guys with a lot of losses become [[03:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12237.16s)]
*  the fucking man. Yeah. Jorge when he did [[03:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12239.16s)]
*  that was fucking sweet. He fucking came on [[03:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12241.16s)]
*  the scene with those knockouts. [[03:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12243.16s)]
*  It is kind of crazy when you see a guy who's like [[03:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12245.16s)]
*  a gun to a point where you're kind of [[03:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12247.16s)]
*  starting to write him off. And then all of a sudden [[03:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12249.16s)]
*  becomes like there was a moment [[03:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12251.16s)]
*  where people like Olvera might be the best pound for [[03:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12253.16s)]
*  pound fighter on earth. Yeah after Gagey. [[03:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12255.16s)]
*  Yeah. I mean that was incredible [[03:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12257.16s)]
*  to do that to Gagey. [[03:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12259.16s)]
*  Gagey versus Islam is very interesting too though. [[03:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12261.16s)]
*  Yeah it is. Gagey's [[03:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12263.16s)]
*  a monster on the feet. Coming off that tail wind. [[03:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12265.16s)]
*  That was fucking wild. He's a [[03:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12267.16s)]
*  monster on the feet. And he's a serious [[03:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12269.16s)]
*  wrestler. Yeah. You know there's a lot [[03:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12271.16s)]
*  going on with that. When he beat Fazeba [[03:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12273.16s)]
*  I was like holy shit. Yes. He beat him [[03:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12275.16s)]
*  at Fazeba's game. Yep. That was [[03:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12277.16s)]
*  impressive as fuck. [[03:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12279.16s)]
*  I wouldn't be surprised if Gagey fucked up Islam. [[03:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12281.16s)]
*  Or knocked him out. I wouldn't be that surprised. [[03:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12283.16s)]
*  You know what Islam's got very [[03:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12285.16s)]
*  underrated striking. That motherfucker is [[03:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12287.16s)]
*  skilled on the feet. He's a very [[03:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12289.16s)]
*  technical throw. He's skilled everywhere. Yeah. [[03:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12291.16s)]
*  He's underrated on the feet for sure. Oh my god [[03:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12293.16s)]
*  his top pressure is next level. [[03:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12295.16s)]
*  His top pressure is just smushes [[03:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12297.16s)]
*  people. Yeah. Everyone says [[03:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12299.16s)]
*  he's just freakishly strong. [[03:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12301.16s)]
*  Boy he's so big. I mean [[03:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12303.16s)]
*  what does he weigh before [[03:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12305.16s)]
*  he cuts to 55. He's gotta be in the [[03:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12307.16s)]
*  190s. Oh damn you think. Yeah. [[03:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12309.16s)]
*  I've never seen him in person. He's big [[03:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12311.16s)]
*  dude. Big fucker. He's got a big back. He's [[03:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12313.16s)]
*  thick. Colby called him out right? [[03:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12315.16s)]
*  Yeah. That's a sick fight. [[03:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12317.16s)]
*  Colby versus Leon will be sweet [[03:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12319.16s)]
*  too but Colby versus. Colby can make 55. [[03:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12321.16s)]
*  He could for sure. Yeah. He's not a [[03:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12323.16s)]
*  big 70 at all. Damn that would be [[03:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12325.16s)]
*  wild. That would be crazy if he wins [[03:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12327.16s)]
*  the bell that won 70 and he's the first guy to [[03:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12329.16s)]
*  go well I guess Henry tried to go to TJ but [[03:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12331.16s)]
*  go down to 55 and fight. [[03:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12333.16s)]
*  Yeah. Because his long probably is [[03:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12335.16s)]
*  bigger than Colby. Probably. Or around [[03:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12337.16s)]
*  the same size. Yeah. That would be crazy. [[03:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12339.16s)]
*  It would be crazy. Has he ever fought at 55 in the UFC? [[03:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12341.16s)]
*  No. No he hasn't. So that would be interesting [[03:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12343.16s)]
*  to see how it cut goes. But you know you gotta [[03:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12345.16s)]
*  get past Leon. That's no fucking [[03:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12347.16s)]
*  picnic. That guy is so. And after he [[03:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12349.16s)]
*  beat Usman in the second fight he [[03:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12351.16s)]
*  realizes his takedown defense is impressive. [[03:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12353.16s)]
*  Is more impressive and his striking [[03:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12355.16s)]
*  is as good as anybody in the sport. [[03:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12357.16s)]
*  That fucking head kick was so [[03:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12359.16s)]
*  nasty. Pound for pound head shot [[03:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12361.16s)]
*  dead. That was so cold. That was like [[03:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12363.16s)]
*  so cold. South paw and south paw [[03:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12365.16s)]
*  too. And Colby seemed to do good against south [[03:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12367.16s)]
*  paws. He takes him down fucking pretty [[03:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12369.16s)]
*  easy. Yeah. Punch take down punch. [[03:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12371.16s)]
*  Yeah. Thing about Leon is you can't [[03:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12373.16s)]
*  zig when you should have zagged. Yeah. [[03:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12375.16s)]
*  You know he'll find your chin. Yeah he's accurate. [[03:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12377.16s)]
*  He's a good striker. He's got that [[03:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12379.16s)]
*  championship level confidence now. [[03:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12381.16s)]
*  Wins the title by the most spectacular [[03:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12383.16s)]
*  head shot. Like one of the most [[03:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12385.16s)]
*  spectacular head kicks in the sport. To win [[03:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12387.16s)]
*  a title in a fight you're losing against [[03:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12389.16s)]
*  Kamaru Usman who is the nightmare. [[03:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12391.16s)]
*  Right. And he's winning and [[03:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12393.16s)]
*  you just crack. In the fifth [[03:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12395.16s)]
*  round in Utah [[03:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12397.16s)]
*  elevation. Yeah. Fifth round. [[03:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12399.16s)]
*  Walk off cage. [[03:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12401.16s)]
*  So crazy. So crazy. John Anik fucking. [[03:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12403.16s)]
*  And he called it. [[03:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12405.16s)]
*  John Anik was the greatest call in sports history. [[03:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12407.16s)]
*  That is not the cloth from which [[03:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12409.16s)]
*  he is cut. Dude whack. Boom. [[03:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12411.16s)]
*  Like what? [[03:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12413.16s)]
*  Yeah. And then Kamaru. You know what? [[03:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12415.16s)]
*  One thing I think Kamaru fucked up was talking [[03:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12417.16s)]
*  about how bad his knees are. [[03:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12419.16s)]
*  I remember he said that on the pod. [[03:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12421.16s)]
*  Because I never knew but then he would he brought it up when he [[03:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12423.16s)]
*  was doing the pod with you. He has to walk [[03:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12425.16s)]
*  backwards downstairs. He has to walk in the grass [[03:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12427.16s)]
*  sometimes. Just talking. I think if you're a [[03:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12429.16s)]
*  fighter and you got some real injuries [[03:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12431.16s)]
*  keep that shit under wrap [[03:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12433.16s)]
*  because if you're fighting someone [[03:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12435.16s)]
*  and I know they're fucked up somewhere or something [[03:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12437.16s)]
*  it gives you a little edge maybe. [[03:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12439.16s)]
*  Maybe not but I feel like he fucked up. It definitely [[03:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12441.16s)]
*  gives you a target. Yeah. You definitely know [[03:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12443.16s)]
*  something's going on. No. You see him [[03:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12445.16s)]

*  been one of his most impressive. [[03:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12505.16s)]
*  That was like one of his first big KOs in the UFC. [[03:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjpGwfyWwlw&t=12507.16s)]
