# Joe Rogan Experience #2135 - Neal Brennan
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [April 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBRl6XECIbM)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day.
*  In sketches.
*  I could say for the air, but we're on there.
*  Oh, we are on the air.
*  Yeah, we're rolling.
*  I just turned my monitor on because I could see myself and I didn't want to be, but what
*  In sketches, I'll just open up with a Chappelle story because that's what everybody thinks
*  they're doing anyway.
*  Dave would be watching himself on the monitor and then, and I'd be like, I don't know,
*  man, just be in it.
*  And then I'd turn and I'd tell the cameraman to turn around.
*  I'd be like, did Neil tell you to turn around?
*  So he couldn't watch himself.
*  It just felt like you're just, if you're doing Rick James, maybe just be Rick James, not
*  see yourself as Rick James.
*  Maybe like affirmed as Rick James.
*  Rick James would look at a monitor.
*  Yes, in that character.
*  I would imagine that's actually a good move.
*  By the way, rest in peace, OJ Simpson.
*  Oh my God.
*  Rest in peace, OJ Simpson.
*  Juice.
*  We lost the juice today.
*  We love you, Juice.
*  Juice, we love you.
*  Sam Tripoli posted something on Twitter today.
*  It was OJ Simpson just said, I did it.
*  He posted on Instagram.
*  But I guarantee you that that's fake.
*  It looks like a fake tweet.
*  Yeah.
*  I watched, there's a lot of fake tweets.
*  There's a video of a compilation of Norm doing OJ jokes.
*  It's 11 minutes.
*  And I watched it.
*  I watched it and then went back and started.
*  It's so glorious.
*  It was so relentless.
*  He was so good.
*  He was so fucking funny.
*  We're talking about OJ.
*  Norm was so fucking funny and the glint in his eyes.
*  And half the time he was bombing on SNL because it wasn't really his crowd.
*  And he didn't care.
*  He did not care.
*  And he kind of got fired for it.
*  Well, he had a view.
*  He had a frequency that he was on.
*  And comics loved it and the audience loved it.
*  Yeah, it wasn't necessarily SNL.
*  Yeah, the audience at home liked it.
*  Yeah, it's 11 minutes of Norm.
*  And then this stare after the punchline as it's either working or not.
*  It's just glorious.
*  That skinny Norm.
*  Look how skinny he is there.
*  Yep.
*  The suit too big.
*  Yeah.
*  And yeah, it wasn't well lauded within SNL.
*  It was like his own guerrilla unit, him and this guy Jim Downey, who wrote all of it themselves.
*  Well, SNL seems like they handicapped themselves, like they're handcuffing themselves.
*  Back then it was less.
*  Less back then, but now for sure.
*  I haven't watched very much.
*  Me and Jost are friends.
*  I haven't.
*  I just haven't seen it in a long time.
*  He's funny.
*  Yeah, just very funny.
*  But like and but but I haven't seen it.
*  I yeah, I haven't seen it.
*  I had a sketch that I wanted Jost.
*  I wrote so that so the week Shane got fired, whatever, unhired, I thought of a sketch and
*  I texted I was going to be in New York.
*  And I have I had like a sort of open door policy at SNL where I could just write because
*  I wrote there with Dave.
*  So so I had a sketch idea for Jost where it was a it was a couple is getting ready to
*  they're in bed and they're like, so any STDs you want to you want to tell me about?
*  And they're like, no, I'm cleaning the any podcasts.
*  And we wrote and then it was like, I did one.
*  It was it was like it was a good idea about Shane.
*  But like whatever.
*  And then we wrote it and then it kind of got shelved.
*  Like my understanding was some of the people at the show didn't appreciate this.
*  And then I was hoping Joe's I was going to text Shane and be like, hey, there's a sketch
*  you should do, but I don't want to be like this room for a show like well, Gillian Keeves
*  is that if you watch Gillian Keeves, I mean, I think I've seen a couple of fucking amazing.
*  It's fucking amazing.
*  It's underappreciated within the Gillian Keeves fans.
*  It's really appreciated.
*  But the mainstream does not know how good those sketches are.
*  He does only only fans dad, a dad who needs to make money.
*  And so he does only fans.
*  It's insane.
*  Does this Trump speed dating sketch?
*  Oh, my God. That one, I think I saw that.
*  They're so good.
*  They're so good because it's buck wild because they're on the Internet and Patreon and
*  and kind of get away with doing whatever the fuck you want.
*  And it just has to be funny.
*  And that's really you can't do that anywhere.
*  You know, if you're on network television, you're dealing with so many executives.
*  They're all terrified and everyone's scared and everyone's ideologically captured.
*  And there's certain things you can't joke around about.
*  And it's like, God, there's so much ground you can't cover.
*  And it's just you handicap yourself.
*  You just you just handcuff yourself.
*  Well, it's also the the as two aged men
*  who have seen many parts of many eras of show business.
*  It seemed it's it's so the whole thing has got the the TV now feels like
*  seventy eight year old woman who still thinks she's fine.
*  And it's like, bitch, you're not fine no more.
*  Do you don't got to carry yourself like like you like, you know,
*  everyone wants to fuck me. It's like, not really.
*  You have all like the props from when everyone
*  wants to fuck you, but there's a lot of other women out here now.
*  And they still think they haven't really adjusted.
*  They kind of can't write.
*  You know what I mean? Like how do you reduce network television?
*  How do you reduce late night TV? How do you reduce sketch shows?
*  How do you it's all the real has to be what it always was.
*  The format is just it's so restrictive.
*  The fact that you have to break for commercials, the fact that you have
*  a specific amount of time, all that is just you can't compete
*  with the Internet because of that. It's just you just can't.
*  And then you have all the meddling.
*  I mean, you've done networks, you've dealt with Comedy Central.
*  It was fucking insane over there.
*  It was insane trying to tell them what is funny and what is not funny.
*  I will say after six episodes of Chappelle Show, they actually said,
*  I believe the quote was, we don't understand your show.
*  So kind of just do whatever you want.
*  They really said, like, we don't understand your show.
*  It's funny. Right.
*  Because that was the thing. There was a.
*  They we we did the sketch, the Mad Real World,
*  and one of the execs said, like, it's an unfunny.
*  It's a collection of unfunny scenes back to back.
*  And I and I was like, well, could we at least show it to the audience?
*  Do you mind? And then we showed it and it crushed.
*  Of course. And then I kind.
*  It's the only and I and I and I got in the execs kind of ear.
*  And I was like, I heard what you said about this.
*  And she was like, hey, Neil, take it.
*  Oh, they were bad because I was like I was kind of attached to it.
*  I was attached to it. And I was also very I knew it's with any of these things.
*  You know, you, Dave, any anyone who started the show,
*  they're jumping out of the plane.
*  Let them pack their own shoot.
*  You know what I mean? Like you're jumping out of the plane.
*  If you don't want to say it or you're not confident in it,
*  then you shouldn't have to say it. Right.
*  And they wanted to pack the shoot the way they thought a shoot parachute
*  should be packed. And it's like, no, they let the jumper do it.
*  And if it doesn't work, then you guys can.
*  It's really like someone who's watched surgery, who wants to cut.
*  It's it's so dumb. It's so dumb.
*  They don't know what they're doing.
*  And they their instincts are almost always wrong.
*  And if they're lucky, they find someone who's really good,
*  who can kind of work around their nonsense and still create a quality show.
*  But a lot of the times it just gets in the way so much that you
*  you get like 60 percent, 70 percent of what you could have had.
*  Yeah. And you got to come.
*  You got to also hope that you get
*  they that the audience overwhelms the network, meaning
*  South Park got off to a hot start.
*  Well, South Park was South Park before Comedy Central was Comedy Central.
*  Right. Yeah, they made a video.
*  They were a little wilder back then.
*  Yeah. Comedy Central was kind of the renegade. Yeah.
*  You know, and then South Park became so undeniable.
*  You had to just leave them alone.
*  They were so good.
*  You just had to go just shut the fuck up and leave them alone.
*  Yeah. And that kind of has to happen.
*  Yeah. So like and it kind of happened with Chappelle show pretty quickly.
*  Like after the blind white supremacists, it was first episode.
*  They were kind of like, oh, and then the ratings were good.
*  So they kind of didn't they tried to meddle, but they kind of their heart wasn't in it.
*  It hit a cultural landmark. Yeah.
*  It hit it hit this thing with Chappelle show was the show.
*  It's like, when is it on? When is it on again?
*  And whereas the man show was more like, ah, yeah, yeah, they're doing pretty good.
*  I think maybe we can help it somehow. Yeah.
*  Or there it's you kind of either want to you need to if you you just have to succeed
*  a big way and then they'll stop.
*  Yeah. They it has to be so undeniable that they have to get out of the way.
*  And you have to actually say that you got to get out of the way.
*  Like, leave us alone.
*  I don't know. But they don't.
*  Yeah. If you don't leave us alone, we're not going to do it.
*  And that's the only way to do it.
*  It's like that format is just so limiting.
*  And, you know, that format was all that existed.
*  And that was the essential format for television.
*  It was the only way to do it.
*  You had commercials, you had an 8 p.m. time slot.
*  This is all simple. You have 44 minutes with commercials.
*  Do it. What would you do if you were the owner of NBC?
*  You know what I mean? Like, I don't know what these companies should do.
*  Comedy Central is basically a production company now.
*  Yeah. Well, they're doing the right thing, I think, in switching to streaming.
*  Right. So it's just a matter of being able to get enough quality stuff on streaming
*  and get people over there.
*  So they're going to have to shell out a lot of money for big properties.
*  And they've done that with like, you know, Disney's done that.
*  And Paramount's done that.
*  And a few of these viable streaming platforms have managed to make
*  like really good shows and put them on streaming.
*  And they can still do that.
*  You know, like there's shows like Shogun, you know, which is just fucking so good.
*  But, you know, it exists in both.
*  It exists in streaming and on television.
*  And they kind of make it for that.
*  You know, you still have the commercial breaks.
*  But when you watch on streaming, you just get the full episode.
*  Yeah. I also think there's probably very little input from advertisers, meaning
*  if something's popular, people will just want to advertise on it.
*  They won't give a shit.
*  What the message is it family hour?
*  Is this does this line up with Procter and Gamble's values or any of that shit?
*  Right. Right. It's just like, yeah, we are their eyeballs. Let's go.
*  Yeah. But even then, I mean, there's people that try to push back even against Shogun.
*  There was this thing about like, why aren't there no black people on Shogun?
*  Well, what do you think it's about?
*  It's about Japan.
*  It's like, what are you talking about?
*  I thought it was about guns.
*  It's like, what the fuck is wrong with you?
*  This is exactly what it is.
*  Yeah, I hope that didn't get very far.
*  No, it doesn't get far.
*  But it's like they try.
*  And that's the indicative of the kind of pressures that those people feel behind the scenes.
*  Yeah, because behind the scenes, it's all a bunch of grifters.
*  It's all a bunch of network executive grifters that are all just working a DEI angle.
*  And they're trying to make like, where's the diversity?
*  I mean, how many times you had pitches where you bring it in?
*  They're like, where's the diversity?
*  I don't have that problem because I generally come with a diverse.
*  I am Mr. White diversity.
*  But like, I hear you. Yeah.
*  And yeah, I don't the DEI behind the scenes shit.
*  I think that they're just they're scared.
*  They're just scared.
*  There's just like, what's the latest priority culturally?
*  So they go like, we have to service that priority or I'm going to get in some kind of trouble.
*  100 percent. And they don't know they don't they're just blowing in the wind.
*  And they're so expendable.
*  You can move network executives around like chess pieces.
*  Just move them around like chess.
*  That road of states. Yeah.
*  Not even chess pieces. Yeah.
*  Yeah. It's not even tic tac toe.
*  Yeah. Just move them along.
*  They don't matter. They really don't matter.
*  And basically anybody could do that job as long as you have good quality television.
*  As long as the people that are making it, you know, the Paul Sims of the world,
*  the people that make really good shows, just leave them the fuck alone and they'll make great.
*  Well, yeah, that's the thing I always want to say.
*  It's like my standards are higher than yours.
*  Well, you actually I want a bomb less than you do.
*  Right. I'm more I don't want this to go
*  poorly. I understand that it's because they're basically backseat drivers.
*  They kind of are like extra like over cranked.
*  Yeah. But like, you know, I I'm worried.
*  I'm more worried than you. I'm again jumping out of the plane.
*  Yeah. Let me pack the parachute.
*  Yeah. That's that's why that's not why they moved to L.A.
*  Well, they also want to make their mark on.
*  Yeah, that's exactly right.
*  They want to jizz in the soup every chance they can.
*  There was a thing I remember on when we were doing Half Baked, I wanted to do.
*  I wanted to say, hey, let us do what we want.
*  And then at the end, we'll pass around a hat and you guys can take credit for something.
*  Like, oh, the title. OK, that's not bad.
*  The cat like just take we just let us do the fucking thing.
*  Right. But that's they want to do the fucking thing.
*  Yeah, always. They want you to get started.
*  You you get the started and then I'll come in and
*  be a producer.
*  I'll be what I imagined a producer was.
*  Yeah. And they did.
*  But they don't have any original.
*  I mean, but the good news is.
*  But you kind of defeated them.
*  I mean, podcasts, YouTube, et cetera.
*  It's like they're on there.
*  It's hard not to kind of curb stomp them.
*  Well, it's just they almost can't compete with the instantaneous access,
*  the free access. You can get it anywhere.
*  Get it on your phone. You get on a tablet, get on your computer.
*  You get it anywhere and it's available anytime you want it.
*  You can pause it. You can leave.
*  You don't have to wait for a time slot.
*  You watch all of them when they come out.
*  It's just that that format that exists, like the Netflix format
*  of releasing the entire season of show.
*  You can't compete with that.
*  People love that. They love binging.
*  They love it. They love the fact that it's available anytime you want it.
*  They love the fact there's no commercials.
*  All that shit is just they're just trapped.
*  And if I was a network executive,
*  if I was at the top of the food chain, I would be really thinking,
*  like, is there another way to do this?
*  Does it have to be this way?
*  Does it have to be commercial breaks?
*  Because nobody watches those. They're not good.
*  They're not funny. OK.
*  But you I've heard and I haven't experienced because I haven't made
*  a show at Netflix other than Santa.
*  The there are things that they they need you to hit certain shit by minute 10.
*  The end of every episode has to be a cliffhanger.
*  Oh, really? That's what I've heard.
*  I haven't experienced firsthand.
*  But so so it's as a, you know, show creator.
*  I wonder if there is a imperative to.
*  Want it. You kind of want to know with the information
*  in terms of like, when do people turn the shit off? Right.
*  When do it will will it?
*  I heard something like if they watch the first.
*  Three, then the watch 10, like you have to.
*  So they're like front load the first three with plot character, maybe set.
*  I don't even know what the so I'm kind of talking out of my ass a little bit.
*  But I do know that they have information.
*  So it's a formula that they're yeah, that they want.
*  It's like you want people to watch your shit or not.
*  Yeah, like I I I in my my new special 53 minutes because I don't need it.
*  I'd never I've never been like, oh, good.
*  It's an hour 20.
*  I it's never better longer to me.
*  And I 53 minutes is perfect.
*  Yeah. And I move jokes up.
*  I was like, that's that joke.
*  That's it's like when you do the live show, the first really big laugh.
*  Like in my live show is probably it.
*  I think it was at 11 and I so in Netflix, I moved it up to like seven or eight.
*  You know, like like the big, big like, oh, fuck, like a different energy laugh.
*  Yeah. Move it up.
*  That's weird, though.
*  But I get it. It's a four.
*  I'm I'm meeting them where they are.
*  Yeah. You know what I mean?
*  I know what you're saying. Yeah.
*  But I don't feel like I'm selling myself out or like I'm the integrity of my act.
*  It's like that's just how I did it.
*  Right. You're just formatting it for this very specific system as opposed to a live show.
*  Yeah. We like setting things up and.
*  Yeah. And at a live show, they're not going anywhere.
*  They can't go anywhere.
*  They're there. They're there.
*  They're there at home.
*  They can watch everything ever recorded.
*  Yeah. Right.
*  I'm competing with everything that's ever been made.
*  The Godfather. Yeah.
*  And I beat. Is this better than the Godfather?
*  Apocalypse Now. Yep.
*  Heat. Yeah. That's right.
*  It's all rocky. Rocky.
*  Anything. All of it.
*  And every comedy special.
*  Every one. And Norm.
*  Yeah. And OJ.
*  And Patrice. Yeah.
*  Yeah. All the old stuff, all the new stuff, everything all together.
*  Yeah. It's an insane time for your attention.
*  Like, yeah. Try to captivate people's attention now.
*  It's just it's an insane proposition.
*  There's just so much available.
*  Are you? I mean, what's funny is you kind of it's you're not.
*  It's not even the tortoise in the hair.
*  You just haven't changed.
*  You just like, I don't know, I just talk for fucking three hours.
*  Well, this is what I did in the beginning.
*  So I just keep doing what I do.
*  I do it because I like doing it this way.
*  And in the beginning, like Ari was the first one.
*  He was like, you got to edit it.
*  You have to edit it.
*  No one wants to listen to three hours.
*  I'm like, then don't listen.
*  It's that simple. I don't care.
*  I'm just going to do the best thing that I can do.
*  Do it how I feel like doing it.
*  And that's it. Yeah.
*  But you know, that doesn't work for most people most of the time.
*  Most of the time it doesn't work, but it works.
*  I'm not even. You know, it worked.
*  But I'm saying, like, do you ever think about why or do you even give a shit?
*  None of your business.
*  I think if you think about why, you'll second guess your own instincts.
*  Yeah. And that's never good.
*  Yeah, because they've been good to me so far.
*  I know what I'm I just stick with me.
*  I know what I like.
*  And if I'm actually genuinely interested in that thing, the subject,
*  I think other people will as well.
*  Like if I bring on someone who's a beekeeper, I don't think, wow,
*  it's going to be a big episode.
*  All I think is like, I'm interested in bees.
*  I want to talk to someone who's really interested in bees.
*  Like, tell me what how do you do it?
*  What's going on? What's happening?
*  What is your do you look at which episodes do you are?
*  You just firewall it.
*  None of your business, none of my business.
*  Yeah, I don't care. I don't pay attention.
*  I mean, I know I hear I hear this one's huge.
*  This one's huge. Whatever.
*  I don't pay attention.
*  I just this is what I'm interested in.
*  I want to talk to this guy.
*  I had a mush. I had Paul Stamets on yesterday.
*  My great expert. Amazing.
*  It's good. Fucking protocol. Guys got his own protocol.
*  I know. Is that's his stuff right there.
*  I host defense.
*  Is this still a side?
*  No, no, no.
*  That's a garracon and turkey tail.
*  That's his immune stack that he uses.
*  There's there's all sorts of medicinal mushrooms
*  that have no psychoactive effects.
*  And do that is any of this stuff proven?
*  Yeah. Yeah, there's peer reviewed studies,
*  random controlled trials,
*  double blind placebo controlled styles with a garracon.
*  Yeah, we talked about that yesterday.
*  Great. He's a real scientist.
*  So what the stuff that he does is very, very legit.
*  And, you know, he's also he's very diligent
*  in the way he sources the mushrooms.
*  They test them, find out which ones have efficacy,
*  which ones don't, because you can have like
*  he was explaining that a garracon they've identified.
*  He has one hundred and seven strains that he has personally.
*  And out of those strains, they've identified
*  at least four of them that are like the most hyper beneficial
*  and they haven't tested them all.
*  But those four, then that's the ones they sell.
*  Great. Yeah.
*  And then some of them are different from different things.
*  Like some of them are better for pox viruses
*  where other ones are better for RNA viruses.
*  It's very, very interesting.
*  Very interesting what they've done.
*  Good. I mean, yeah, that's you know, this shit is it's cool.
*  It's we have lived in a time with a.
*  A good amount of change.
*  Yeah. Oh, there's a lot of change.
*  There's a lot of change going on for better and worse.
*  Yeah, I don't know how much worse.
*  There's a lot of confusion, but I think ultimately there's more
*  information and that's always better.
*  And there's more freedom of communication, although there's a lot of
*  attempts at restricting freedom of communication.
*  There's still more avenues of communication than there's ever been before.
*  Which is almost always good.
*  And and we've talked about this before, but the trusting that people can
*  people can figure it out.
*  Yeah. Well, they have to learn to figure it out.
*  Just like people had to learn what things to eat that are poison
*  and what things are edible.
*  You know, like you have to learn that.
*  And we have to learn that with information.
*  We have to learn that with everything.
*  We have to learn that with styles of communication.
*  We have to learn that with, you know, people that are really shitty to people.
*  Like people don't like that.
*  That's not necessary.
*  Learn that. People need to learn that.
*  And that's how you learn that you learn it by watching people sort of get ahead.
*  But just by being cunts and they don't go so far and the audience turns on them
*  and recognize that some people are just, you know, communicators
*  and just calm and nice.
*  And that's better.
*  And you could still get all the same information and still have
*  interesting debates and conversations.
*  You don't have to be a cunt.
*  Yeah, the the I because I think about I'm not very.
*  I feel like you're paranoid or not paranoid.
*  You're skeptical of.
*  Control, right? Yeah.
*  And I and I and I always go, why am I not skeptical of control?
*  Like compared to you or compared to a guy like Dave, who's also very skeptical
*  of any sort of authority or institution.
*  And I think I was thinking, I'm so glad to not be under the Catholic church anymore.
*  That everything is better. Right.
*  To me, like the government, I don't give a fuck. Right.
*  Like I truly don't.
*  Apple, you want to listen in? Good.
*  I don't give a shit.
*  You can't send me to hell.
*  So I don't even care if you overhear me.
*  I don't. I just this is better than the way I grew up. Right.
*  Even a and then I'm but I am I'm skeptical.
*  It's it's one of those yin yang things where I'm skeptical of too much
*  information chaos.
*  You know, it really I'm sure this will be probably the balance
*  of the next at least 20 years.
*  Well, information chaos is also engineered.
*  And that's one thing to take into consideration that information
*  chaos is not always organic.
*  I agree. But and then what about that?
*  If if if, you know, Russia, China are and our enemies,
*  in quotes, wink, wink, whatever. Yeah.
*  Like what?
*  You know, if somebody somebody's Dave made a point that if you're
*  if a country has racial divisions anyway
*  and then and then an outside actor so, you know, foments them,
*  it's the country's fault for having them in the first place.
*  And it's like, yeah, but that's kind of bullshit, because like
*  if there's a marriage that is having trouble and then someone comes in
*  and fucks with it, that's the outside person's fault.
*  Because the married people want it to be good.
*  Do you know what I mean? Like America is going to have conflict naturally.
*  And I think it's natural to have that.
*  And it's OK to have that. And we need to figure that out.
*  But the once the outside actor comes in,
*  I still blame the outside actor for fomenting.
*  And that's and I feel the same way with the information stuff.
*  Like I'm I'm with you in terms of like we do need freedom.
*  But I still blame the outside actor for coming and creating more chaos.
*  I think it's an unavoidable evil.
*  If you're going to have freedom, you're going to have the freedom of bots.
*  You can have the freedom of people that hire people in these troll farms
*  where they have thousands and thousands of accounts
*  and they just push different narratives and they get involved.
*  You know, we had Renee deResta on once who studied this.
*  And one of the things that she studied about, what are the things that Russia
*  had done during the 2016 election was the creation of memes.
*  And some of them were really funny.
*  And they were memes that were very specifically designed
*  to push certain narratives and make fun of certain things
*  and that they had made so many accounts, thousands and thousands of accounts.
*  They had actually organized a Texas session
*  meeting across the street from another.
*  I know that shit was so it's so like Monty Python.
*  Yeah, meeting. Yeah.
*  They wanted these people to be fighting with each other.
*  Yeah. And they do that online constantly.
*  There's so many times.
*  Well, I'll see something that's contentious, something that's socially
*  something that's like very explosive.
*  And then I'll look in the comments and I'll see some outrageous statements.
*  And it's like a couple of letters and a number for the account.
*  And I'll click on the account and I'll go into, oh, it's a fake account.
*  How many of those are there?
*  There's fucking hundreds of thousands, if not millions.
*  There is an FBI analyst that that did an estimation.
*  And he thinks that there's 80 percent.
*  He thinks 80 percent of the Twitter accounts that are in
*  in circulation, at least at the time, were trolls.
*  Yeah. And so
*  that would be part of the information chaos
*  that I'm like a bit like, this is going to be bad.
*  It's bad now. And it's probably only get worse with AI and all that shit.
*  And and I don't but I don't know what the.
*  I don't know if we talked about this, but like if there was a governing
*  body. You know, let's say like over not
*  let's say over all of social media, sort of morality or whatever, or ethics.
*  Who would you even put on it?
*  You can't. It can't be done.
*  It can't be done because the government can't be trusted because they're doing it.
*  Right. But let's say the people elected it.
*  Do you know what I mean? If there was a way to get the right.
*  Get around the government. It's not possible.
*  For instance, like who? John Stewart.
*  Yeah, but they would people would have access to that.
*  Like John Stewart couldn't talk about China on Apple.
*  So he left. He left. Yeah.
*  It doesn't work. No, I'm with you.
*  I'm that's that's corporate.
*  I'm saying like, who are even?
*  I think the solution is more complex.
*  The solution is no.
*  The solution is technology ramped up to a point where lying is impossible.
*  And I think that is going to be tight.
*  You're going to be able to have opinions.
*  But lying about specific facts, I think, is going to be far more difficult
*  with widespread use of A.I.
*  And also when people have universal ability
*  to translate languages instantaneously.
*  Right now, it's a little clunky.
*  You could read tweets and you could say translate the tweet.
*  You can you can do things like that, but you don't necessarily know
*  what the fuck is going on when it's universal.
*  When you're going to have instantaneous translation into that,
*  you're going to it's going to be far more difficult to deceive people
*  when you have instantaneous access to A.I., which is so
*  as long as the A.I. is not biased, which we've seen A.I.
*  is programmed in the Google A.I.
*  You know, founding we talked about this like eight years ago
*  when I pitched robo president.
*  And then it became if there's a row, if there's an A.I. president,
*  then it's the thing that's going to be argued about is
*  what information are we loading in? Right. Right.
*  And what are the values that the A.I. has?
*  Like, is the values for the human race?
*  Is the values for New York City is the value for the country in general?
*  Yeah. What is the values and what is what is its imperative?
*  Like, what is it trying to do?
*  Yeah, it's but the thing is like that's rudimentary.
*  A.I. as A.I. scales up and gets far more advanced.
*  And it's going to happen very quickly.
*  It's going to bypass all that stuff.
*  And it's going to come up with some sort of a moral,
*  ethical foundation that everybody is going to have to operate under.
*  That's good. It's going to be very weird, Neil.
*  And it's going to be very weird, very quickly, very quick.
*  I totally agree with you.
*  Yeah, I completely agree with you.
*  I mean, in some ways, whenever I hear about A.I., I'm like, help us.
*  I come and sit with them like it may obliterate us.
*  I'm like, but if it doesn't, please help us.
*  A.I., please help us get out of all this garbage we've gotten ourselves into.
*  Yeah, it could both help us and obliterate us.
*  It's it's going to be a wild ride.
*  It's going to be a wild ride.
*  And when do you think it'll be four years at the most and four years were fucked
*  and four years, everything's tossed.
*  Everything's fucked.
*  I mean, there's so many things that there just we kind of like let slide today
*  that won't be you're not going to be able to let like
*  congressional insider trading slide.
*  It's going to be a real problem.
*  You're not going to be able to have bills where you have a border
*  funding bill that also has funding for Ukraine.
*  Yeah. Like there's all that kind of stuff is going to have to go by the wayside.
*  You think A.I. will prevent that? Yeah.
*  How come? Well, because people will be able to analyze everything
*  about every bill instantaneously.
*  It's not going to be as simple as, you know, you have to sit down
*  and read a 2000 page bill.
*  It's going to be A.I. is going to break it down.
*  And it's also going to break down who the people are that propose the bill.
*  And then also what the influences these people have in terms of who their donors are.
*  And you're going to get like very specific breakdowns of what all these things are.
*  And people will be far more informed. I.
*  My feeling on that is that people.
*  Are in some ways are informed and we're all kind of powerless to change it.
*  There's a little bit of that.
*  You know, I mean, like Citizens United or like dark money or astroturfing
*  or or or pork and bills or tying things together
*  or emergency. It's just all the shit of like, how the fuck are we supposed to even
*  move the needle at all as people? Right. At all.
*  It's it seems impossible.
*  The way the shit's set up.
*  Yeah, it definitely does now.
*  And I don't and A.I. doesn't seem like, oh, I don't think that.
*  I don't think the problem is a lack of understanding.
*  I think the problem is a it's the system set up so that it's
*  the only way to get a law made is like getting a building name.
*  You got to have 10 million bucks.
*  You know, there's a little bit of that going on, too.
*  I mean, there's no way to run for president unless you have hundreds of millions of dollars
*  backing, which is just insane.
*  It's insane. And money and there's no way to run for Senate.
*  Yeah. Without without a hundred.
*  Right. You're getting a job.
*  It's one hundred fifty thousand dollars a year.
*  And you're spending people in the primary have one hundred.
*  Yeah. Sweetie. And then that's not.
*  Yeah, it's like Nikki Haley that had no chance of being president.
*  Had hundreds of millions. Yeah. Yeah.
*  And that's just like, oh, fourth runner up.
*  Yeah. Congratulations. Yeah.
*  It's it's it's and I don't and that's one of the things we're like, how does A.I.
*  help us? Supreme Court's locked in for.
*  As long as they live, fucking insane.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Until you die, a star like a sci fi star chamber
*  until you die. Wow.
*  And that's a horrible idea.
*  It's not even dependent upon whether or not your ideas are even
*  they even make sense.
*  Like you see Katanji Brown Jackson, who they asked her what a woman is.
*  And she said, I'm not a biologist.
*  Yeah. Right. But you're a woman.
*  Like maybe take a crack.
*  You know, what's funny is because you go more right.
*  You go to her and I'm thinking Alito.
*  You know, you just see what's whatever Alito.
*  I'm just talking about one thing that's ridiculous.
*  If you ask me what a man is, I can tell you what a man is.
*  Yeah. I'm not a biologist.
*  Yeah. I'm a man. Yep.
*  Yes. So the.
*  I do worry about.
*  I to me, it's not even a lack of information.
*  Sometimes it's a lack of information.
*  I mostly think it's rigged against the people.
*  It's rigged against the citizens to not have any say in any of this shit.
*  It definitely is somewhat.
*  But you also do need someone who actually understands the law
*  to withhold the Constitution, to uphold it and to make sure that like you don't
*  pass things that do violate very core tenets of how our society is structured.
*  What did Alito do that?
*  Oh, I don't know. I'm just as a liberal.
*  I'm just like it seems like those guys want to like get.
*  I'm pretty very, very liberal.
*  What a liberal used to be. Right.
*  No, that's what I'm saying. You learn more.
*  Lean more. Right. I learned.
*  I don't even lean more right.
*  I lean more center, which is right now.
*  Yeah, it's just it's so the left has gone to so far to the left.
*  It's gone so far into this strange territory.
*  This bizarre land of cult like thinking it's very.
*  It's driven by the it's sort of everyone's afraid of upsetting.
*  It's the tyranny of the minority.
*  No one can say, hey, do me a favor.
*  Shut the fuck up or we're going to lose all of this.
*  If we make this about just your minor
*  grievance or issue, we're going to lose the whole thing.
*  But they it becomes about the various, you know,
*  D.I. or transgender or whatever, all these things that are that are
*  not unimportant, but they're just not the most important.
*  And no, you're not allowed to say to someone anymore.
*  Your shit is not the most important thing
*  because of whatever the ego mania of our culture.
*  Everyone's issue is the number one issue.
*  And it's like, no, it's a number one issue for you.
*  But it's not the number one issue for half of the population of the country.
*  Well, it's also the thing is, if you oppose any of these protected ideas,
*  you'll get you get attacked.
*  Yeah, you get attacked and labeled as the worst thing possible.
*  Yeah. Whatever that is.
*  When you're in when you agree with them in 99 percent of other issues.
*  Yeah. Yeah. But they because it's they just prioritize.
*  It's just this thing of like, no, this is it's like the kids playing soccer
*  where it's just running a bunch of this is the most important thing.
*  And it's like, is this really?
*  And you can't go, the fuck are you talking about?
*  You have to go. Yes. I honor.
*  You have to start bowing and I honor you have to do the Nancy Pelosi
*  down on a knee with the Kente cloth.
*  It's like, no, that's an important issue.
*  It can't be the it might not be the most important issue.
*  And then they go, well, then we're not we're going to withhold our vote.
*  Oh, really? You're a fucking child.
*  And you don't understand the way politics work.
*  If you're going to withhold your vote because of one issue.
*  Yeah. And it happens.
*  And it's just and it's also a revolving thing of like,
*  we're going to withhold because of Israel, we're going to withhold
*  because of transgender, we're going to withhold because of the we're going to
*  withhold on and on and on and on.
*  And it's as someone who is on their side, it's a bit like, oh,
*  please shut the fuck up.
*  Yeah, because you're going to blow this for all of us.
*  Well, each party becomes captured by the most extreme versions of it.
*  Yeah. You look at the right, the right gets captured by, you know,
*  people think of the right, the thing like Proud Boys or something like that.
*  Yeah. I think of the or guns just got.
*  Yeah. The left, they think of or now abortion. Yeah.
*  Yeah. There's always something.
*  Yeah. There's always something that's ridiculous.
*  And there are and then you and then it turns out that like
*  the Republican stats on abortion are like
*  fifty five percent of Republicans think abortion should be, you know what I mean?
*  And it's like, well, then how the fuck did they because
*  they it's you know, it's almost like they did.
*  It's they always say about Republicans, they're like the dog who caught the car.
*  You know, like they they they use
*  abortion as a, you know, driving issue, thinking like it'll never happen.
*  And then they it happened. They're like, oh, fuck.
*  Yeah. OK. I guess I guess Arizona goes, OK, we're going back to 1864
*  or whatever. It's a law from the 1800s that they upheld two days ago.
*  Well, it's always interesting how ignorant people are about the rest
*  of the world, too. Like I'm going to Europe where women have the right to choose.
*  Well, go to France because they have a limitation there, too.
*  It's like I think it's well, no, no one ever looks it up.
*  Also, try to get a try to get citizenship.
*  How are you going to do that?
*  How are you going to do it?
*  Look it up once. But they haven't looked it up.
*  I've been doing a joke about how American women are like American men are the worst.
*  And I'm like, who do you think's coming?
*  Who do you who's coming?
*  Italian guys, first of all, they're bringing their moms.
*  That's a and B, you're going to have to start cooking dinner at two fifteen
*  every afternoon. I hope you're happy.
*  Well, that's the least of your words.
*  Sharia law. I mean, that's the ultimate punchline.
*  It's like Middle Eastern guys.
*  I'm not even going to finish this joke because it's they don't have the best
*  sense of humor about about their.
*  Yeah. But if you look up like look up genital mutilation.
*  Yeah, it's really grim.
*  Yeah. In terms of the what these other guys are out here doing, ladies.
*  Not like us American hero men.
*  No, but it is it really is like a pretty people don't look it up.
*  They just they like sulking.
*  Yeah. Well, also, there's so many issues that most people are just not informed.
*  They just know what their side goes with.
*  And so they adhere to whatever the whatever the doctrine is.
*  I was I remember looking up abortion laws worldwide four or five years ago.
*  I mean, like, oh, it wasn't as like blanket as I thought.
*  Well, Burr had the best bid on that.
*  I think you should have the right to choose.
*  But I also think you're killing a baby. Yeah. Yeah.
*  I mean, at a certain point in time, it is a baby.
*  The question is, right.
*  And that's right.
*  That's the whole thing of when because I did a joke
*  like I, you know, liberals have to support everybody, not fetuses.
*  And and the New York Times wrote me up like I just saw Neil
*  Brennan do it sort of anti-abortion joke.
*  And it was like joining Bill Burr and George Carlin.
*  And I was like, are you trying to insult me?
*  Because thank you for that fucking barbed insult.
*  But but yeah, like the even knowing when even if you go,
*  no, I believe it doesn't start.
*  It's all sort of.
*  Scientists like the heartbeat or the fetal, whatever.
*  It's all a bit like you're all guessing.
*  Yeah. And I will also I'll admit, I'm guessing it's just which guess
*  suits my needs.
*  Do you know what I mean?
*  Like if I'm if I got a girl that I'm not trying to be with, who's
*  who's pregnant, who's who's periods late, I'm like, I believe in abortion
*  to the fifth trimester.
*  Like I believe in it late.
*  Whereas if I'm if I'm, you know, not if I'm 65 and can't get somebody or whatever,
*  probably can't get 65 or whatever, whatever age.
*  There is no age of Al Pacino just had a kid.
*  Al Pacino's 80 years old.
*  I know. Fuck. 80 years old.
*  Yeah. And he also wanted to make sure the kid was his,
*  which is like a great way to start.
*  Somebody I know was doing pick up at school with with De Niro.
*  Like recently, it was just like, yeah, I can't believe you're still doing this.
*  Well, isn't this is like I mean, how many times has he been married?
*  These guys just did just dive right back in.
*  Yeah, I've never understood that.
*  I've never understood that need.
*  Like Ruben Murnauq just did it.
*  I think Murnauq just got engaged.
*  I think they're just comfortable with having a partner
*  and they just don't want to exist in this weird state
*  where they're texting people and calling people,
*  especially when you're in your 70s.
*  You know, you're trying to hook up.
*  Don't get me wrong. It's humiliating.
*  Right. I bet if you're a 70 year old famous guy and you get divorced, I bet.
*  I bet it's probably pretty easy to find someone new
*  who like plays the role and probably pretty easy to get duped.
*  Pretty. Yeah, because they know.
*  Yeah. You're like the time is on my if I'm the girl, I'm like, time,
*  I just got to ride this baby out.
*  Yeah. All you have to do is just be the right person
*  that this guy needs for a small amount of time.
*  And you don't have to work ever, ever again, ever.
*  Like if you're a person who's running around there, scratching out 60,
*  70 grand a year and barely getting by.
*  And then you hook up with them in order to change your life.
*  You just have to need to you need to stand in Robert De Niro's eyeline.
*  Yeah. Yeah. With what my friend calls available sexual energy.
*  Yeah. Available sexual energy and just be nice.
*  Just be nice to him. Yeah. Needs just talk to him.
*  You're candy striping.
*  Yeah. You just don't have to work hard.
*  So don't be offensive. Don't be rude.
*  Don't don't fuck with them. Don't insult them.
*  Don't play the same games that you'd play with a 30 year old guy
*  that doesn't have any money.
*  No. Play play a different game.
*  If he doesn't text you back, it's because he doesn't know how to text, sweetie,
*  because he's a fucking old dude or he can't.
*  It doesn't have his glasses. You can't see what you wrote him.
*  A lot of this.
*  Yep. That's the sad part about being our age is anytime I go look at this meme,
*  all my friends have to put glasses on and start holding.
*  Just like, oh, Christ fucking humiliation.
*  You can mitigate some of that.
*  There's a there's a there's certain vitamins that you could take
*  that stop macular degeneration.
*  Pure encapsulations has a macular support formula.
*  But doesn't work legit.
*  Yeah, it stopped it. Stopped it for me.
*  For you? Yeah, totally stopped it.
*  Totally stopped it.
*  You were like, do you wear glasses?
*  I can. Yeah, I wear glasses when I write.
*  You know, I wear reading glasses when I write, but I can look at my phone.
*  No problem. I could read websites.
*  No, did it get better or just stop?
*  Got a little better. Yeah.
*  Little better with red light to red light therapy.
*  You have a red light bed that I lay in.
*  And that do you are your eyes open?
*  Yeah. Yeah. Keep your eyes open.
*  And you're laying in bed.
*  Yeah, it's just staring at red lights, just chilling.
*  Usually just listen to books.
*  Yeah, I would like to do that because it gets it's worse.
*  It just gets it's such a bummer.
*  Ari got surgery.
*  He got Lasix on his eyes and then his eyes got worse after the surgery.
*  They got better. That can happen sometimes, right?
*  You have the natural course of macular degeneration that takes place as you age.
*  So his eyes were great at first, like this great off to wear glasses anymore.
*  And then a couple of years later, five, six, seven years later,
*  starts getting really shitty again.
*  And it's just they go, yeah, that's just.
*  Yeah, I think that happened to Bill Maher, too.
*  It got worse. He couldn't. He kept getting Lasik.
*  I maybe I'm remembering this wrong.
*  And then at a certain point, they're like, we can't LASIK you.
*  And you just have to wear glasses.
*  That's scary.
*  Getting more and more eye surgeries is fucking terrifying.
*  Yeah, that's that's probably the the one that makes you wince the most.
*  Because those those videos.
*  It doesn't go well every time.
*  Like, yeah, certain times where people get infections or it just doesn't.
*  Or you just your eyes are fucked.
*  You have a halo around lights and shit.
*  Oh, yeah. I have a friend who can't drive at night.
*  He got Lasik's and now he can't drive at night.
*  I think I would murder the doctor if that happened to me.
*  He was so upset because he's like, I could have driven at night
*  and just worn glasses when I had to read things.
*  He goes, now I can't drive at night because if the headlights see him,
*  it's like he's blinded by halos.
*  You can't see around the circle.
*  Like, he doesn't know where the car is, where the headlight is.
*  He just sees this circle of light that surrounds things like headlights
*  and streetlights, just terrible.
*  Yeah, I don't.
*  That would that would make me so that would make me feel so sorry for myself.
*  If I went for surgery and was like worse off.
*  Yeah, that's a problem with some surgeries.
*  And the problem with surgeons is that, you know, when you have a hammer,
*  everything looks like a nail.
*  And, you know, that's the only solution.
*  I mean, yeah, that's most, you know, I've had a bunch of surgeries that I avoided
*  where the doctors are like, you're going to need surgery.
*  And I was like, are you fucking sure?
*  Like, are you sure? Knees, shoulders, like shoulders is the big one.
*  Yeah. I wound up getting stem cells in my back.
*  I had bulging discs now, like you got to get that trimmed.
*  And I was like, are you sure? That's the only way to do it.
*  It's not the only way to do it.
*  What do you do? Decompression stem cells fixed it.
*  I have zero problems.
*  Yeah. Zero problems with my neck.
*  Zero problems with my shoulder.
*  I had a full length rotator cuff tear in my shoulder.
*  And they were like, you're going to need surgery.
*  One hundred percent.
*  And I went back to the doctor six months later.
*  It's like, this is fucking crazy.
*  Like that that tear doesn't exist anymore.
*  What is the stem cells?
*  Yeah. And direct into it.
*  Direct into it. Yeah.
*  And all was it did you have to go far?
*  Was it just like local?
*  Well, I did it in Vegas and I did it in L.A.
*  I did it several times.
*  I think I did three injections in my shoulder.
*  And then six months later, I got another MRI.
*  And they're like, you don't have a tear anymore.
*  The doctor was blown away because this was all, you know, we're talking about.
*  I think my injury was like 2015, 2016, somewhere around then.
*  So this was all fairly recent in terms of like the amount of the kind of results
*  they were getting. And this doctor had never seen anything like it.
*  He was blown away. He'd been an orthopedic surgeon for 20 years.
*  Did you have to do anything?
*  Did you have to rehab it?
*  I did regular rehab.
*  Like once I got the surgery, I did like.
*  But you're trying to bring back.
*  What do you bring in? You're regenerating tissue.
*  You're regenerating. Can rehab help you with that?
*  Or is that just it strengthens it?
*  I think the the rehab with the stem that the key is, it's like not injuring it
*  while you're healing.
*  And the problem is it starts feeling better and then you start pushing.
*  Then you re aggravate the injury and then you're in this repetitive cycle.
*  But if you can avoid that, like my friend Shane Dorian,
*  he's a big wave surfer, and he got serious stem cells down in Tijuana
*  where they could do wild shit.
*  And he got his entire back done.
*  So they put him under and they do every disc in his back.
*  And they're like, you can't do anything.
*  Like you can only walk for like a couple of months.
*  Like that's all you could do.
*  And for a guy like him, who's a world champion surfer and he's an athlete
*  and he's always exercising, he's always doing something.
*  He was crazy to just not.
*  All you could do is walk.
*  But now he feels fucking incredible.
*  And it's and he has the back of a 20 him his old back.
*  Well, it's definitely a lot better than it used to be.
*  Yeah. You know, and that's the key to these things.
*  And if you were allowed to do those in America, like you're allowed to do those
*  overseas, I think you'd see remarkable improvements.
*  But the problem is then you have orthopedic surgeons who don't want this to happen.
*  And they'll try to tell you not to do it, because more people do it.
*  They start telling more people to do it.
*  People can avoid surgeries and they're going to be out of a job.
*  There's one of these in.
*  Jimmy, if you bring this up, there was there's a there's a film
*  that they can put on teeth.
*  That will basically just prevent cavities forever.
*  Really? Yeah, I saw it like three weeks ago.
*  There's like a microscopic film invisible.
*  Like they like kind of paint it on.
*  They want to do it on kids like low income kids.
*  And and it will again, maybe I misread it.
*  Jimmy, if you look it up.
*  Wow, I haven't heard of that.
*  Yeah, no, it's a new thing.
*  But there are and I'm not even I mean, I am conspiracy minded in terms of like,
*  yeah, people try to prevent that.
*  But I wonder which ones they'll let through.
*  Well, if there's money in painting people's kids with that stuff,
*  they might let it through.
*  The scariest one is fluoride.
*  The fluoride in the water thing is bananas because they're like, oh, it prevents tooth decay.
*  It also fucking causes a drop in IQ.
*  That's absolutely measurable.
*  If you could see the difference between the amount of fluoride in the water
*  and the amount of the drop in IQ is in that area.
*  It's there's a direct correlation.
*  It's but it's in like a lot of countries.
*  Fluoride is a weird one, man, because there's a lot of like
*  very credible scientists that would point to the fact that fluoride is a neurotoxin.
*  It's not good for you at all.
*  And they're like, oh, yeah, but in small doses.
*  But fucking says who says who and for what purpose?
*  The way I pointed out, it's like, say, if someone gets skin cancer and you say,
*  oh, OK, well, we're going to put sunscreen on all the apples.
*  Well, hey, hold the fuck on.
*  How about just brush your fucking teeth?
*  Why do you have to put that shit in the water?
*  So every time I cook spaghetti, I have fluoride in my fucking spaghetti.
*  Like, what are we doing?
*  Like, yeah, I mean, I don't I'm curious because I looked this up recently
*  because I what I've heard is the amount of fluoride that makes it toxic is like
*  just a huge amount.
*  It's like the dog eating chocolate thing.
*  You look up how much chocolate a dog has to eat to kill it.
*  Yeah, it's like half its body weight or something.
*  It's like it's a huge amount.
*  And I what I remember is that in order for fluoride to be toxic,
*  it's got to be a major amount. Right.
*  But there's a correlation between high levels of fluoride in water and low IQs.
*  There's we don't really know.
*  And it's developmental cycle of a child that you're interfering with.
*  So if you take children and you give them this neurotoxin
*  and you have it in the water to prevent them from getting cavities
*  and you literally lower their IQ, which seems possible.
*  Yeah, I don't know.
*  I don't know how they came to the decision.
*  Fucking reason to do it.
*  There's no reason to do it.
*  It's stupid.
*  Cavity fighting liquid prevents 80 percent of cavities.
*  Finds largest US study new treatment uses silver diamine fluoride,
*  sorry, buddy, which is an inexpensive liquid that prevents cavities.
*  It never brought it.
*  Well, it's a surface thing, though.
*  You're not covering.
*  Well, it's stuck in your mouth, though, I think.
*  Not drinking it.
*  What's it what's it saying?
*  Dental cavities are distressing sensation that if left untreated,
*  can result in terrifying pain, swelling and relentless restless nights.
*  Team of researchers at New York University identified a cavity
*  fighting solution that is both effective and affordable.
*  New treatment uses silver diamine fluoride,
*  which is an inexpensive liquid that prevents cavities
*  and even shields the existing ones from getting worse.
*  So that doesn't really prevent you from getting cavities.
*  It like stops cavities.
*  Didn't it just say it's shield cavities?
*  Well, it's an inexpensive liquid that prevents cavities.
*  But it doesn't cover the teeth and prevents future cavities.
*  I believe I believe maybe in the next paragraph, it'll say that
*  it's quicker to apply and less expensive than sealant.
*  So it seems like they're doing it on cavities, prevent and arrest cavities,
*  reducing the need for drilling and filling.
*  So they can prevent cavities on people that don't have cavities,
*  and then they can fill the cavities with this stuff and prevent them from getting worse.
*  Dental cavities are prevailing concern, center of disease control.
*  But doesn't just brushing your fucking teeth prevent cavities?
*  Yeah, yes.
*  This is one of those things.
*  No, I have.
*  I haven't had cavities since I was a little kid.
*  I just brush my teeth.
*  Thank you. Fluoride.
*  I don't think that's tonight's episode that Joe wrote.
*  I don't use fluoride in my home. Is that true? Yeah.
*  Yeah, I try to avoid fluoride wherever possible.
*  I just you live with I mean, but with the first half of your life was all with you riddled with fluoride.
*  I'm sure I got it.
*  Until a couple until you move here.
*  Fluoride to know. Yeah.
*  Even when I live in L.A.
*  No, I never drank.
*  Oh, you didn't. You had your own well.
*  I never drank water out of the tap.
*  Never. It's fucking terrible for you.
*  It smells bad.
*  It smells like chemicals.
*  And even if it's like mostly OK, it's like, why are you doing that to yourself?
*  Like, have you ever seen any studies on fluoride?
*  And the ones I saw were just like, it's pretty minor.
*  The ones I've seen.
*  It's not necessarily minor.
*  It's poison and it's not necessary.
*  There's no reason for it.
*  And it seems like there's a lot of money tied into fluoride fluoridating drinking water.
*  Look up countries that fluorinate their fluoridized for a fly for a bad day.
*  Their water.
*  Because it's I looked it up.
*  Yeah, I looked up.
*  So if we all have bad IQs, it's fine.
*  Did you watch the Sinanon thing?
*  There's a HBO documentary about this.
*  It's really you'll really like it.
*  It's like about what?
*  It's called Sinanon.
*  Sinanon. It was like a group.
*  It was a bit of it.
*  It was a cult.
*  And then they started out as like kind of a self-help as like a 12 step fellowship.
*  It's the classic.
*  Then it became a cult.
*  Then the leader goes crazy.
*  I'm on it's only episode two, but it really does follow like the the the thing of like every cult.
*  At some point, the leader goes, hey, I spoke to God and he needs me to fuck all your wives.
*  Sorry, guys.
*  Sinanon. Yeah.
*  What is it about?
*  It's it's a old cult.
*  It's from the 70s.
*  Yeah. The Golden Age.
*  The late started in the 60s, went into the 70s, starts in black and white.
*  Anything about this?
*  Yeah. It's on HBO Max.
*  Everyone shaves their heads.
*  It's fucking right up your alley.
*  Like it's yeah, there's the guy.
*  Yeah, they have audio of him screaming at them.
*  An attack against Sinanon was attack against.
*  Yeah, it's it's it's it's custom made for you.
*  That's beautiful.
*  I've literally never been on for it.
*  Just came out last week.
*  Oh, I have a thing in my in my new Netflix about where I'm talking about you.
*  I'm talking about I'm talking about the outsize role that.
*  You know, because corporation,
*  corporate leaders have been are basically a piece of shit.
*  Politicians are a piece of shit.
*  Clergy, imams, pastors are a piece of shit.
*  Now, somehow it's all become like, well, what do the clowns think?
*  Now it's up to the now it's up to comedians to be the moral arbiters.
*  And it's you, Dave.
*  I mentioned Ellen, I mentioned Kevin Hart, I mentioned just all these people.
*  That's like, why are you guys consider?
*  I mean, I know why, because it's just everyone else couldn't do it.
*  And comedians have opinions and like Carlin was moral sometimes.
*  John Stewart is moral, you know, but I don't.
*  But it's one of these things like it shouldn't be up to us guys. Right.
*  We're like, we shouldn't be the backstop.
*  We're we shouldn't be the moral backbone of America.
*  But one of the rare people, the rare groups of people that are allowed to speak freely.
*  Yeah. And that's what it is.
*  It's like we're the one as long as we can find an angle where it's funny.
*  Well, that's the thing is people are mad.
*  It's like on here, people get mad at you for not.
*  Being a reading the talking points of the National Institutes of Health.
*  You know what I mean? Like what I never understand what people want you to be.
*  Like, what do you walk me through this
*  where Joe says everything you want them to say?
*  It's not possible. It's also not.
*  It's not a show anymore.
*  Right. But you also you can't make everyone happy.
*  It's impossible. Yeah.
*  And if you try to operate in this world where you're trying to make people happy
*  versus just trying to be honest, you're fucked.
*  You're fucked. You're fucked from the jump.
*  There's no way to do that. It's not possible.
*  You won't be you anymore.
*  You will be compromised. Yeah.
*  You know, I mean, I feel that about so many things.
*  I feel that about reading comments.
*  I don't think you should read comments.
*  I don't. I think that it's it's a it's been a detriment.
*  Yeah. To certainly like public
*  comment or whatever we do,
*  whatever like public speaking to because it really does kind of you think about
*  like, well, what are they going to what's the worst thing you could possibly say
*  about what I'm thinking of saying? Right.
*  And it's a bad way to approach things.
*  It's also people that are deeply dishonest, of course, and deeply unhappy.
*  And yeah, yeah.
*  Like they did with your joke about abortion.
*  Like, oh, right.
*  He's just a grifter. He's a pro-abortion grifter.
*  Yeah. Trying to get that right wing money instead of just trying to make a point.
*  But everyone's trapped.
*  They're trapped in these ideological bubbles and they don't know what to do.
*  And it's if you keep reading the comments on that bubble, you will stay trapped.
*  You will stay trapped. You're fucked.
*  You have to be you have to be able to think freely and express yourself freely.
*  And you can be wrong. And if you're wrong, you have to be able to admit you're wrong.
*  And you have to be able to say why you're wrong and why you thought this and why
*  you think differently now.
*  And that's just a function of being an honest human being.
*  And it's possible to do.
*  But, God damn, that is a white water rafting trip that is fucking filled with rocks.
*  Yeah. There's like there's bears catching salmon.
*  It's it's crazy.
*  Scrape your fucking. Yeah.
*  It's scary. It's scary.
*  How do you like do you do you monitor yourself at all?
*  Do you know what I mean? Like, do you have you had have you gone like, well, this is
*  getting pretty. This is getting pretty.
*  This megaphone is getting pretty big.
*  You're having to hire a lot of security at your live shows.
*  You know what I mean? Like, just I'm assuming like the bigger the venues are getting
*  bigger. There's just more.
*  Does it ever go?
*  Does it? I mean, it's got to be validating for you as a person.
*  Right. You got to be like, oh, I must have I kind of I must have done some shit right.
*  And then does it make you police yourself?
*  Do you go like, let me really try to be.
*  I think it makes you you you definitely have to be more clear with what you think
*  and why you think it instead of just shooting off the cuff, which I definitely
*  used to do a lot when I was younger.
*  I'd have an idea in my head and I just run with it and then I try to defend that idea.
*  But even the fluoride thing, right?
*  Yeah. What we just talked about.
*  That's the same conversation we would have had 10 years ago.
*  Sure. Right. Yeah.
*  Does it do you now think of how do you go?
*  I have to know what studies are what and if that's true and it's been, you know,
*  replicated, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
*  Or is it still kind of the same like, yeah, I think I read that the same thing we all
*  do generally, which is like, yeah, I read that or I heard that or whatever.
*  Well, it's been a while, but I've read multiple studies.
*  No, no. Yeah. But I'm saying to multiple experts.
*  If I didn't, I would say I'm not sure.
*  I'm not sure. I'm not sure.
*  But fluoride is not healthy.
*  It's not a good thing to take.
*  I'm just wondering about your process.
*  That's one of those ones where I can just say that.
*  But then there's other things where it's like a vegan diet.
*  I know people that do it.
*  I know people that have pulled it off.
*  It's possible to do it.
*  You look like shit.
*  I'm just kidding.
*  You look thin and healthy.
*  But you can do it if you supplement carefully and you're a smart guy.
*  You know what to eat and what not to eat.
*  And I can get my blood tested.
*  Yeah, you get invited.
*  You have money.
*  You can do all the things you do to make sure that you're OK.
*  And it absolutely can be done.
*  I know people that eat a vegan diet.
*  And I also think there's biodiversity.
*  There's some people.
*  Their ancestry is very different.
*  Their their genetics are very different.
*  And they're they're much more vegan diet is more tolerable for them.
*  Like Indian people.
*  Indian people have been eating vegetarian food for so fucking long.
*  You know, I would imagine that their body,
*  their genes have adapted if they've come from a long line of vegetarians.
*  Yeah, like they're kind of stuck with vegetable and they're kind of stuck.
*  Maybe it would be beneficial for them to supplement.
*  Or they figured it out.
*  They have it.
*  Their body is figured.
*  If whatever was deficient in it's figured out a way around it by what was available to them.
*  Right. But when we look at countries that consume more meat, they they're healthier and they live longer.
*  Hong Kong is a great example of that.
*  So there's some great studies that have done been done on Hong Kong.
*  They have like one of the highest meat consumptions and higher life expectancies.
*  And yeah, then there's also like a blue zone.
*  How long have they been doing it? Yeah.
*  And the blue zone of the like a little bit of protein.
*  Yeah, that's it's I guess what you're saying is the acknowledgement that like shit's complicated.
*  And there's no one right or wrong.
*  There's also things like healthy user bias, like the most important thing that pretty much
*  most of the objective doctors will say the most important thing is physical activity.
*  And then if you are not physically active and you eat well,
*  you're almost better off smoking cigarettes and being physically active.
*  Then yeah, then then doing that.
*  By the way, this is always fascinating to me because I've been asking people,
*  do you know what percentage of people die smokers die of lung cancer?
*  What percentage?
*  Ten to 15 percent.
*  That's crazy. Isn't that low?
*  That's crazy. Wouldn't you think it's like 60?
*  That's crazy. It's 10 to.
*  And I've looked it up repeatedly like, am I miss reading this?
*  The amount of smokers that die of lung cancer is 10 to 15 percent.
*  But do they die of other stuff?
*  Well, yeah, of course, coma, diabetes, etc.
*  Yeah, but like smoking just in general, like you're limiting your oxygen intake.
*  There's a lot of factors.
*  Yeah, but it's not as bad as you.
*  Right. You know what I mean?
*  This this one doctor that I was talking to that was very adamant about that,
*  because physical activity, if you don't have physical activity,
*  you might as well be a drinker and a smoker.
*  Yeah, you're fucked.
*  And then there's also the loneliness thing.
*  Oh, yeah, that's a big one.
*  Man, it's a big factor.
*  What percentage of folks studies found the risk of developing lung cancer
*  increases to 14 percent if you smoke cigarettes.
*  If you smoke one to five cigarettes per day, your risk is around seven point seven percent.
*  And if you smoke more than thirty five cigarettes a day,
*  you have a 26 percent chance of develop.
*  Well, that's a lot.
*  That's thirty five cigarettes, though, by 80.
*  I know it's like a whole lifetime like smoking thirty five.
*  What is that, a pack and a half?
*  Yeah, almost two.
*  Is two packs forty?
*  Yeah. Twenty and a pack.
*  Wow. Twenty six.
*  That's still three out of four.
*  Yeah, it's like you're.
*  Which, by the way, is the exact same number of FDA drugs that get pulled.
*  Twenty five percent of all FDA approved drugs get pulled because they kill too many people.
*  Oh, right. When they're like, oh, fuck.
*  We didn't test it good enough.
*  Yeah. Whoopsies.
*  We believe those pharmaceutical drug companies.
*  Yeah. That was that was the weird one for me during the pandemic was the trust
*  in the pharmaceutical drug companies.
*  And especially when I started talking to experts that actually spent their living,
*  litigating financial settlements for adverse effects of drugs.
*  And you find out that scientists, when you hear about peer reviewed data,
*  they're not even allowed to see the actual data.
*  They see the analysis of the data by the pharmaceutical drug companies that perform the studies.
*  I I'm of two minds about this, because on the one hand,
*  I agree with you and I've had similar experiences.
*  And on the other hand, I'm like, people, I don't fucking have time
*  to do the research on all of these things myself.
*  And I have a lot of time.
*  Like, do you know what I mean? Like, I don't I don't they are.
*  Everything's fucking corrupt.
*  And it's so aggravating and so like predictable because just human beings.
*  And they're just going to be corrupt.
*  And you just have to hope that the thing that you're
*  the pill you're taking wasn't a victim of the corruption or the operation
*  or even the stems or whatever you do.
*  You just have to hope it wasn't a victim of humanity.
*  And so I'm with you because I've heard shit about that.
*  I've learned you can test for anything.
*  It's a you know, I've heard statisticians say you can make anything.
*  You can crunch numbers any way you want to get to what you need.
*  Well, they certainly have done that, you know, and that's that's the big Vioxx scandal.
*  Like in the emails when they released Vioxx, they literally said,
*  which one's Vioxx?
*  Vioxx is an anti-inflammatory that they use that is no better than
*  non-steroidal anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen.
*  And it's killed somewhere in the neighborhood of 60,000 Americans for it was pulled.
*  Well, there was that other one, the IBP, not the one,
*  the antihistamine that wasn't anything.
*  What's that?
*  The Sudafed one, the one that was like a month and a half ago.
*  Most cough medicine wasn't medicine.
*  What?
*  Look at it.
*  It was, I was, I assumed you just did, you did like an emergency episode about this.
*  No, look at, I don't even know what to look up.
*  Cough medicine isn't medicine.
*  It's fraud.
*  Yeah.
*  Look up cough medicine isn't medicine.
*  It was fucking insane.
*  And, but again, I have, my kid has a cold.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  So my kids literally stuffed up this very second.
*  I'm a parent.
*  The fuck am I supposed to do?
*  Right.
*  You get medicine.
*  This is medicine.
*  It's at the store.
*  Cough medicine.
*  Got it.
*  You got cough medicine for them.
*  Okay, good.
*  I'm a good parent.
*  This should knock it out.
*  Yeah.
*  And it turns out it's just a bunch of garbage.
*  What is it, Jamie?
*  Do you find anything?
*  Yeah, I got, I'm trying to dig through.
*  I got conflicting information real quick.
*  This is what happens, Joe.
*  Yeah.
*  This is what happens.
*  The pharmaceutical drug companies are like little trolls.
*  Bunch of fake studies.
*  Or shit's complicated.
*  Yeah.
*  Shit is definitely complicated, but there's also a lot of financial.
*  No, I know.
*  That's the issue.
*  It's with all this stuff.
*  It's like shit's complicated and people are corrupt and people try to thwart
*  information and bad information rises.
*  And there's no, it's just, it's, it's spider meme.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just everything's fucking incredibly complex.
*  OJ was dead for about an hour before I saw people connecting to the vaccine.
*  OJ was telling people to get vaccinated.
*  Well, maybe, maybe, maybe this guy who murdered his fucking wife and her
*  boyfriend, maybe he was wracked with guilt his entire life and lived in a
*  constant state of anxiety and everywhere he went, people yelled at him and called
*  him a murderer and maybe he didn't sleep good.
*  Anybody, by the way, still made it to 76.
*  Right.
*  Which is like, I think two years older than most people die.
*  I think the average age is like 72, 74.
*  Like what's the average American male life expectancy, Jamie?
*  It's either.
*  Yes.
*  I'd say 72.
*  I want to say 72.
*  Well, black men is way lower.
*  And fucking football players is probably 58.
*  Right.
*  Good point.
*  But.
*  Which is interesting too, because one of the things that is one of his attorney
*  said that if CTE, the information was available today, like it wasn't 94, they
*  would have used that in his defense.
*  Right.
*  Okay.
*  Which is kind of crazy.
*  But that, well, does he get, does he, does he found more innocent?
*  76.
*  So 76 years.
*  So he hit the number.
*  OJ.
*  Good for you, Jules.
*  OJ landed exactly on the average American number.
*  Here's what I found.
*  So the FDA press release says this.
*  Yeah.
*  FDA advisor declares ineffectiveness of widely used over the counter decongestant
*  active ingredient.
*  The active ingredient in decongestants was nothing.
*  Popular over the counter medicines for colds and allergies don't work.
*  FDA panel said, and that's Sudafed.
*  What it really is, is it took, I guess it's like this ingredient in there.
*  Sudafed, Benadryl and most decongestants don't work.
*  Wow.
*  The over the counter histamine, antihistamine, Benadryl is not being pulled from the
*  pharmacy shelves.
*  So misleading headlines it says.
*  Despite misleading headlines such as Sudafed, Benadryl and most decongestants
*  don't work, they're not being pulled from pharmacy shelves.
*  A FDA Food and Drug Administration advisory committee voted 16 to zero on
*  Tuesday.
*  The current scientific data does not support the use of active ingredient
*  phenylofren and over the counter products such as Benadryl, algae plus
*  congestion.
*  This does not however pertain to antihistamines such as Benadryl, which
*  contain the active ingredient diphenhydramine.
*  Yeah, this is already confused.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like I'm already like, wait, what?
*  They're probably mucking around with the stuff just to try to get it a little less
*  less scammy.
*  It says it's a nasal decongestant.
*  Okay.
*  Brand names, the medications include phenylofren such as Benadryl have other
*  products with distinct active ingredients.
*  So there's one ingredient that doesn't work.
*  Okay.
*  The FDA committee voted on the question of whether or not the evidence support
*  the use of the active, how's that word?
*  Moiety?
*  Moiety?
*  Moiety phenylofren as an effective nasal decongestant.
*  The panel panel concluded that products which include phenylofren are not
*  effective against nasal congestion, though they were not deemed unsafe, but
*  they don't work.
*  So that's like-
*  Parts of them work.
*  One of the ingredients doesn't is nothing.
*  But it says, but it says that that the products that include phenylofren are not
*  effective against nasal congestion, though they were not deemed unsafe.
*  It still says it doesn't work.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  There might be other ingredients that do work, but they might not work either.
*  We'll have to wait and see.
*  Though the FDA is not bound to the committee's recommendations.
*  Why should it be?
*  It's only science.
*  Very likely the agency will follow its advice.
*  In turn, this may lead to pharmacies pulling products containing oral
*  phenephene, pheny, phenylphrene, phenylphrene, phenylphrene, at least until
*  acceptably reformulated versions are offered.
*  There are branded products that include names, Sudafed and Benadryl that do work
*  as nasal decongestants.
*  They contain the active ingredient, pseudoephrine, pseudoeph, ephedrine.
*  Ephedrine.
*  Yeah.
*  Pseudoephedrine.
*  Yep.
*  But because the dangerous illicit substance, methamphetamine, can be made
*  in illegal laboratories with pseudoephidrine, these products were placed
*  behind the counter years ago.
*  In 2005, Congress passed the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act, which
*  required pharmacies and other retail stores to maintain purchase laws.
*  Yeah, you got to show your driver's license.
*  I remember I bought some of that stuff once and I was like, what?
*  What do I have to do?
*  Yeah.
*  And they were like, yeah, people can make meth with this.
*  I'm like, you know who I am?
*  I'm never going to stop talking about that.
*  I'm like, how much meth can you make off of one of these things?
*  Is it enough?
*  Like how many?
*  No, yeah, they would go from pharmacy to pharmacy.
*  And just get boxes and boxes of it.
*  Yeah.
*  And then cook it up.
*  It's just like, just get a job.
*  Also just get Adderall.
*  Yeah, or yeah, exactly.
*  They'll prescribe that to you.
*  Just say, well, yeah, we're running short, Joe.
*  Apparently we are, right?
*  Yeah.
*  We're running short on Adderall.
*  Uh-huh.
*  Uh, yeah.
*  So no, it's interesting to see, you know, you and people we've known so long being
*  held up as like, uh, you know, when it's like, what was the thing you, uh, fit
*  Simmons helped you steal back a car radio or something didn't fit Simmons when you
*  were roommates, you guys are you dated his roommate?
*  Oh yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I jumped a fence because my car got towed and they had my radio in it.
*  I jumped a fence to get my radio.
*  So that's the joke me and Fitzsimmons have whenever there's a headline like
*  White House concern with Joe Rogan.
*  We're like, I bet this is about the radio, right?
*  Him jumping the fence to steal that car radio in 1990.
*  Yeah, I forgot about that.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Like, like it's funny.
*  He was like, what are you doing?
*  I'm like, I'm going to hop this fence.
*  Get my fucking radio.
*  Yeah.
*  And he helped.
*  He was, he aided and abetted.
*  But it is like, Hey, who, I don't know.
*  Maybe you and David are as good as it.
*  I don't fucking know.
*  You know what I mean?
*  You know, everybody should be able to discuss things.
*  And the problem is I can discuss things and millions of people hear it.
*  That's the problem.
*  And do you ever, yeah, that's one.
*  I guess I'm wondering, like, does it, does it.
*  Yeah.
*  I think you're right to not pay attention, but it does a party.
*  You're like, should I be paying more attention to this?
*  Should I be more concerned about being a news outlet or whatever the fuck you're
*  supposed to be?
*  I think I, I, I'm very careful about certain things.
*  And I'm very careful that I, at least now I know what I'm talking about, or I say,
*  I don't know what I'm talking about.
*  Yeah.
*  Like be clear.
*  And then also, you know, if you know something and you don't say it and that
*  thing can benefit people or they can inform their decision making, you should say it.
*  It's important, especially if you know things, if you absolutely know something
*  to be a fact, like say it.
*  And especially if you realize there's like immense pressure on the people
*  there's like immense pressure from these financial institutions or, you know,
*  pharmaceutical drug companies or whatever it is to not say that thing because it's
*  going to, it's going to do you feel squeezed?
*  Not squeezed, but do ever people ever, do you ever feel people floating information?
*  Are you like, Oh, I definitely float that baby up on the screen.
*  Conversations with people where I'm like, this person's feeding me bullshit.
*  Yeah.
*  Definitely.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like, you have to learn how to like navigate those waters.
*  Like I definitely think people have probably been angled to come on the show
*  to feed me bullshit or, or feeding me bullshit once they get on the show.
*  Yeah, definitely.
*  And you know, you have to kind of make a decision then, like, do I even air this?
*  Do I not air this?
*  Do I, do I, how do I dance around this?
*  Like this seems like we should pause this and actually research it before we go any
*  further, because I feel like I'm being fucked with.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And it is, it is, there is, it's the new institution, news media, institutional
*  news, uh, legacy media or whatever.
*  It's another one of those like 77 year old women who still think they're fine.
*  It's like, you can't fucking lie.
*  If you pretend you have a monopoly on the truth, you know, what you
*  have to only say is the truth.
*  It can't be.
*  Obviously there's biases, whatever human biases everywhere and institutional biases,
*  but some of these people are so cl- lazy.
*  Well, it's just like you were saying with the 75 year old woman that still thinks
*  she's hot, like the news still thinks that people believe them, you know?
*  And I encountered that when they were saying that I was taking horse medication.
*  Yeah.
*  You mean the horse medication that won the Nobel prize for being, for an, as an
*  anti-malarial that one like four years ago, four years before, and now it's for
*  horses?
*  Well, everything's for horses.
*  Well, yeah, everything's a horse medication.
*  If the horse is sick enough, uh, grass is fucking everything.
*  If a horse eats it, they're so dumb that they thought that they could do that.
*  Yeah.
*  Which is absolutely wild.
*  Yeah.
*  But that just shows you the arrogance of those organizations.
*  Yeah.
*  They're so full of shit and so captured by money that they're willing to lie and
*  that not just lie, but lie with the same lie across multiple platforms.
*  And they're doing it specifically because they're being told to do that.
*  Yeah.
*  And they're just hammering credibility for, like for what?
*  For nothing.
*  For one thing that is, it's going to last for a year or so until people realize what
*  the fuck is going on.
*  And now you're doomed.
*  And now everyone's going to go, yeah, but they lied about that.
*  What do they say about Iran?
*  What do they say about Syria?
*  What do they say about this and nuclear energy?
*  What do they say about pollution?
*  Well, what's funny is it is super, it makes it complicates things.
*  That it like, what are they saying about Israel?
*  Like the Gaza and Israel feels like the, uh, it's like the most modern.
*  It in 20 years ago, this would have been like open and shut 20 years ago.
*  It would have been nine 11, right?
*  They did this.
*  We're going in and anything we do is justifiable.
*  Right.
*  And now it's, they did this, we're going in and they're going with the
*  77 year old former fine woman and they're doing shit thinking that
*  they can get away with it.
*  And now it's like, ah, now everyone's watching the, all the shit that, that
*  slowly leaked and came out of a grave, all the sort of severe violations.
*  Now we're, it's all happening on the daily.
*  Yeah.
*  And it makes things.
*  It's so everything's so complicated.
*  It's so complicated.
*  One of the interesting things about the Israel thing was that, you know,
*  Hamas attacks on October 7th and within days there's pro Hamas rallies.
*  So before Israel has even retaliated, Douglas Morris talked about this a lot.
*  That was the most insane.
*  And I think that is one of those things where I am very inclined to think that
*  that is fueled by foreign actors.
*  I'm very inclined to think that TikTok algorithms and bots and all these
*  different things fed a lot of these like hyper woke kids into taking this
*  contrarian stance against the popular narrative that, you know, Israel was
*  just attacked and said, no, Israel's an oppressor and look at the, done to
*  Palestine, it justifies it and what else can they do and like, what else can they
*  do besides go door to door and rape and murder people?
*  Is that really what we're saying?
*  Yeah.
*  Like that you should cheer them.
*  I know.
*  And that's, and, and then, and then they, Israel does shit all the time.
*  That you're like, fucking don't do that.
*  Exactly.
*  Exactly.
*  But at the same time, I'm like, I'm not.
*  Yeah, it's like,
*  Oh, imagine living there though.
*  Imagine living either in Israel or Palestine and trying to find a solution to that.
*  Good.
*  It's you.
*  Once you, you look at it, once you start researching it, you just go, fucking, this
*  is not, I don't think I can figure this baby out.
*  This is a video game that you just toss the controller.
*  Yeah.
*  Fuck it.
*  I'm not, this, this, I don't even like this kind of game.
*  And I was reading today that there's, there's state departments warning that
*  Iran is planning attacks on Israel.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh my God.
*  Oh my God.
*  What are you doing?
*  Yeah.
*  And do you have nukes?
*  Do they have nukes yet?
*  Like, I know they've been working on a nuclear program forever.
*  What if they're the first person to use it and they use it on Jerusalem?
*  Jesus Christ.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  Yeah.
*  But people think that they have, they know what it should be.
*  And it's like,
*  Do you get anxiety thinking about like world events ever?
*  Yeah, I, I, I get it.
*  Less so, less so in that, which we can talk about a little bit, but, but less so just
*  in terms of my own personal development.
*  But it's, if I had kids, I would really, really worry about it.
*  Well, I don't, yeah, I don't, I have, I'm involved with a woman who has a kid.
*  So it's like, you know, it's growing my, my sort of paternalism, but yeah, I don't,
*  I don't, it's, it's a, it's pretty weird.
*  This is a pretty rough time.
*  It's a weird time.
*  It's a really weird time, but I think every time is a weird time.
*  Like in the 1960s during the Vietnam War, people were terrified of the future.
*  And yeah, I remember during George Floyd, Chris Rockos, this is every week in the
*  sixties, Martin Luther King and Malcolm X both got assassinated.
*  Like Martin Luther King and Malcolm X and Bobby Kennedy and John Kennedy.
*  Real quickly.
*  Yeah.
*  Over a course of a few years.
*  Yeah.
*  I think it's just, we, we develop societal amnesia and we try to remember the past as
*  some sort of a utopian time, you know, but then if you like, look at the documentaries
*  about the weather underground and like, there's always been like wild shit happening in
*  this country.
*  Yeah.
*  It's, but it's also back then wild shit you really only heard about through large
*  corporate media.
*  I know that's the funny thing is now it's like, we're getting, you don't need to leak
*  Abu Graib, you don't need to leak Gitmo photos, you know, it's all, it's all coming
*  out that afternoon.
*  Right.
*  And then now there's the rise of independent journalism, you know, the Glenn Greenwald,
*  it's Matt Taibbi, some people that you can actually trust.
*  Michael Schellenberger, people that are like on the street, like telling, and they're
*  not attached to any large corporate media outlet.
*  And that's very important because now you get a, if you're willing to do the work and
*  willing to read what they're saying, you get a much more balanced, nuanced perspective
*  on what the factors are and what all these different contributing factors that are so
*  hard to sort out with everything.
*  Like if you try to pay attention to what's happening in Brazil right now, you're like,
*  Oh my God, what the fuck?
*  If you try to pay attention to what's happening in any other foreign country,
*  anywhere, literally like Canada, shit that should be like, used to be like a gimme,
*  like, Oh, Canada is fucking fine.
*  And then you go like, what the fuck?
*  Yeah.
*  Mexico, just go, let's start at the top and go down Finland, Denmark, Iceland, all of
*  them.
*  And then how was mass immigration, illegal immigration ubiquitous?
*  How is it everywhere in the world?
*  All at one point in time.
*  How is like islands in Italy getting overrun with these African immigrants that are
*  coming over on boats?
*  So I made a really good observation, which is migration.
*  It's been happening in all of human history.
*  But not like this.
*  Well, I don't know.
*  I mean, the statistics in the country, in this country, they're really easy to find.
*  Yeah.
*  But I'm saying probably not relative to 17.
*  They'd probably have like great records until pretty recently.
*  Well, they didn't have an open border policy until really recently.
*  Yeah.
*  It wasn't as easy to come across.
*  You also weren't being incentivized.
*  You weren't being given money.
*  You weren't being given housing and shelter and much to the demise of the people that
*  are poor that live there that are American citizens that are freaking the fuck out in
*  these poor communities.
*  And you also know that immigration helps the economy.
*  Do you know what I mean?
*  Like that's the thing it provides.
*  Everything's fucking like, yeah, but also so that's where I go.
*  I don't know.
*  That's Tim Dillon's perspective.
*  He thinks they're bringing in cheap labor.
*  He thinks that's always what it's been.
*  Including like a town like our great grandparents.
*  Like it was just they needed jobs.
*  Yeah.
*  They need jobs.
*  And there was.
*  And then the reason I don't did you read the Cliff Nesteroff book about comedians getting
*  canceled historically?
*  No.
*  You might want to have money or it's really good.
*  But what is it called?
*  Look it up.
*  I've read it like not long ago.
*  K.L.I.P.H.
*  Book.
*  Nesteroff.
*  N.E.S.T.
*  What is K.L.I.P.H.?
*  That's his name Cliff.
*  Oh, Cliff.
*  Yeah.
*  Cliff Nesteroff.
*  Comedians, drunks, thieves, scoundrels.
*  No, the outrageous history of showbiz that one.
*  But the reason why so many Jewish people, Irish people and black people became comedians.
*  It was just because they couldn't get jobs anywhere else.
*  Lenny Bruce.
*  Yeah.
*  There it is.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And like who why they get canceled, who gets canceled.
*  And it's been happening.
*  Guy saying I can't say anything in 1938.
*  Right.
*  Like it's so it's like kind of a tale as old as time.
*  Yeah.
*  But but yeah like people came for for job.
*  Yeah.
*  It's all of these things.
*  You're right.
*  And and it helps the economy.
*  There's a meme that I found online that is it's so funny because it's from 1934.
*  It's a cartoon from 1934 that's basically saying exactly what everyone is worried about
*  today both on the right and on the left.
*  I'm going to send this to Jamie about the government.
*  It's crazy because this is the same story.
*  It's 100 years later.
*  It's the same story.
*  Yeah.
*  Pull that up.
*  Yes.
*  It's like it's the same one is like Jews are subhuman and superhuman.
*  Look at this plan for of action for US.
*  Spend spend spend under the guise of recovery bust the government blame the capitalists
*  for the failure junk the Constitution and declare a dictatorship.
*  Cartoon appeared in the Chicago Tribune in 1934.
*  Yeah.
*  Isn't that why the government is is like you know spying on you and they're inept.
*  It says up there it worked in Russia so that's Stalin I guess is writing that out.
*  Yeah.
*  Wild.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what it's.
*  It's a lot.
*  But I read this time does feel pretty specific.
*  This does feel especially grim.
*  Yeah.
*  This period of history.
*  But yeah the anxiety thing I'm that's curious to me that I'm not curious but I'm
*  interested in the fact that it does give you anxiety.
*  What does it give you anxiety for your is it humanity overall.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah it's humanity overall.
*  I get it at night.
*  I get it at night because usually that's what I'm high.
*  There was a.
*  Usually when I'm writing I'm high.
*  Yes.
*  I get real anxiety because usually also everyone else in my house is asleep.
*  So it's just me and it's late at night and I'm just doom scrolling and I'm writing
*  and I'm just thinking about the future and I genuinely get this like fear of
*  angst like what happens if everything goes totally sideways which has happened
*  historically all over the world.
*  With with incredible regularity.
*  Yeah it's almost predictable and there's always been instances where society was
*  like thrown into chaos and like what we have this even democracy thing.
*  It's the same way like when you look up where is abortion legal where you know
*  where's where where they put in Florida in the water.
*  Look up where there's democracy and how long it's been there.
*  Super easy.
*  This is the oldest one guys.
*  And it's not even three.
*  And it's not even.
*  It's like this is the oldest one then there's like France England like and there's
*  not that many of them now.
*  And there's never been one like this and this one is only 300 years old.
*  Yeah which is a blip.
*  Yeah nothing.
*  Yes relative to two.
*  And it really and it does it is that thing of like you have to foster it.
*  You got to you got to water it and you got to till the feet you got to vote you
*  got to get you got to do research you got to do all the shit.
*  And it's but as we both attest like it's worth it.
*  Yeah.
*  Well this is the greatest experiment in self-government the world's ever
*  experienced.
*  It's fascinating.
*  It really is.
*  And it's it's also because of this this country has achieved so many amazing
*  milestones creatively like how much music has come from America.
*  I mean how much of like popular music that the world here the airplane.
*  Yeah.
*  That's us.
*  The Internet.
*  The car the car the computer.
*  Yeah.
*  Like these are not small things.
*  Standup comedy.
*  Yes.
*  Yeah standup comedy was invented here and it's done but best by people from here
*  still to this day.
*  Correct.
*  And that's just undeniable.
*  You know good luck.
*  Good luck trying to England what we do.
*  Yeah it's just not there yet.
*  It's fun.
*  A few guys.
*  No Ricky Gervais and Jimmy Carr.
*  A couple of.
*  I there's.
*  But the reality is there's a lot more here.
*  Yeah.
*  A whole lot more selling out arenas.
*  Yeah.
*  Just good and good.
*  Good comedians.
*  I think this is the best time for comedy that's ever existed.
*  I really do.
*  I mean there's.
*  In terms of the amount of really good people who are throwing the ball very fast.
*  Yes.
*  I couldn't agree more.
*  Couldn't agree more.
*  Yeah.
*  This is the time.
*  This is the golden age of comedy.
*  Yeah.
*  And you know Ari always says this that this is a great time for comedy because
*  comedy is dangerous again.
*  Yeah.
*  You know it's great.
*  Yeah dangerous.
*  Yeah.
*  It's it is like like the you know the Red Fox you know after dark records.
*  But now it's more in weirdly now it's more like Douglas Murray books and speeches.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  Like those are like the the contraband.
*  What do you.
*  I want to ask about the anxiety thing because when you.
*  Do you get.
*  Do you worry about the safety of your loved ones.
*  Yes.
*  Do you worry about like your your your shit hits the fan plan because my plan is hey I've
*  done Joe Rogan when people come up I go you may remember me from Joe Rogan.
*  We're good right.
*  Oh you mean with preppers.
*  The preppers come for you.
*  Yeah they're not going to come for you.
*  The people that are going to come for you the people that aren't preppers the people
*  that don't eat food that's what's going to be.
*  I don't have any either though.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't have any either though.
*  Yeah well that's good.
*  Hopefully you don't have any guns.
*  Hopefully you don't have anything valuable that they could take.
*  Do you think it's worth having a gun.
*  Yes.
*  OK so you're saying have a gun.
*  It's better to have it not need it than to need it and not have it.
*  Yep.
*  Always.
*  Yeah.
*  It doesn't hurt you to have a gun especially if you're smart and you take care of it and
*  you lock them up and you know how to use them.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah it's like you know one of the funniest things is people like you should give up your
*  AR 15.
*  You don't need it.
*  You should send it to Ukraine so they could fight the Russians like.
*  OK.
*  Do you see what you're saying.
*  Like they're they're they're they're literally fighting against an oppressive force and if
*  they're unarmed you should arm them.
*  Well what happens if something like that happens here.
*  And you're saying oh yeah I mean I did I did that it can't happen here is crazy.
*  The idea of like taking it there should be every year they should have a guys who are
*  like hoarding weapons thing that they could take on the government.
*  We should every year have an NRA military showdown.
*  Where it's 100 guys from the NRA versus like three guys from the military and it's just
*  they're just going to drone them.
*  Right.
*  But here's the thing the guys from the military the guys who sign up for the military are
*  the guys who don't want to do that.
*  So well I know that's that's the thing like turning them on Americans.
*  So this is the big fear about immigration is that you're going to take these immigrants
*  and you're going to indoctrinate them into the military and they'll be willing to do
*  things that United States citizens won't be willing to do because nobody wants to join
*  the military anymore.
*  Oh you think that is that.
*  That's a big fear amongst the heavy duty conspiracy theorists.
*  They're worried that they're going to conscript these people like you can get like look
*  they're doing that in Russia where they're saying fight in the Ukraine war and we'll
*  let you out of jail.
*  Yeah.
*  So they're taking prisoners with life sentences and using them as cannon fodder.
*  Heck of a movie by the way.
*  Yeah.
*  It's happening.
*  I mean they're they're literally using them.
*  No I know it's it's and it's real like some monsters.
*  Monsters.
*  That they're letting out.
*  Yep.
*  Monsters.
*  And they're doing monster shit too.
*  I've heard they've done it to other Russia and they're just doing what they're not.
*  These are not like rational people.
*  No they're psychos.
*  Yeah.
*  Like full on psychos and psychos in Russia.
*  That's another level.
*  I got it.
*  Shut it down.
*  Yeah.
*  A long history of violence.
*  Yeah.
*  And also loss like the loss that they experienced during the World War.
*  Like people they always everyone talks about what happened with Israel what happened
*  with the Jews what happened with the United States or our military Japan Russia lost a
*  lot of fucking people and if it wasn't for Russia we might not have even fought off the
*  the Nazis.
*  I think it's I don't think there's any dispute there.
*  I think that's like that was like they they kind of kept their attention right.
*  Yeah.
*  On the on the east.
*  Yeah.
*  And they are they have such a long history of conflict and loss and their willingness
*  to.
*  Well that's what somebody told me is like Putin's whole thing is just like we're a
*  country where it's we're always at war.
*  We always will be at war.
*  Let me lead us.
*  And he's a warrior which is really scary when you've got a guy who's a KGB guy that
*  becomes the head of the country.
*  I mean again it's the hammer thing.
*  You know all you have is a hammer.
*  Yeah he doesn't.
*  Well that's what some of you say it's like they don't have much industry.
*  Also he kills everybody.
*  Yeah.
*  Anybody political opponents anybody is questioning him.
*  You get poisoned you get fucking drone bombed whatever.
*  Yeah you don't even got to be in Russia.
*  Yeah.
*  They got a guy and they popped a guy in Spain a few months ago.
*  Oh yeah they'll pop you everywhere.
*  Yeah.
*  Poison.
*  And we kind of do that too.
*  I'm sure we do that.
*  I mean the idea that we're innocent and that we don't have CIA assassins they go and
*  whack dissidents.
*  OK.
*  I'll take your logic.
*  Can we still condemn what he does.
*  It's hard.
*  It's hard.
*  First of all what if he does it 10 times worse than us.
*  You definitely can condemn what he's done in Ukraine.
*  You can definitely can condemn you can condemn bombing Kiev.
*  You can definitely can you can condemn a lot.
*  You definitely can.
*  But you also got to condemn the NATO for moving their fucking arms closer to the
*  Russian border and crossing that boundary and trying to get Ukraine to join NATO
*  which has always been his red line.
*  There's a lot of like really.
*  Yeah I don't.
*  I don't.
*  International politics.
*  I'm of the mind that NATO's have never invaded anyone.
*  So it's kind of like if they're I get that they're trying to get the point you made
*  about trying to get people to move to Austin.
*  They haven't been around that.
*  No I know they have.
*  But they definitely.
*  But I don't think you get.
*  Yeah I'm with you.
*  I just don't think they're an invasion.
*  They're too disorganized.
*  They need consensus from fucking however many countries are in NATO to like we're
*  going to.
*  I don't think.
*  And then who's going to govern whatever the idea is pushing arms closer to the
*  borders of Russia to make an attack easier and quicker.
*  And all those things influence foreign policy.
*  And those things are dangerous.
*  They're.
*  Yeah I'm with you.
*  But I don't.
*  I like.
*  Is it.
*  Is he.
*  Is NATO.
*  Perfect.
*  No.
*  No.
*  But like what he's doing is just aggressive bullying like hey man we're trying to
*  have a world where people can't do that anymore.
*  Right.
*  We're trying to get back because it's.
*  My point is that it's.
*  It breeds chaos.
*  It's complicated.
*  Like we we.
*  The United States was involved in the coup in 2014.
*  We instigated it.
*  We we provided weapons and money.
*  We were a part of that.
*  And there's there's been a lot of those throughout history.
*  I mean we fuck around.
*  We what did we we Google that the other day.
*  How many countries the United States has military bases in it.
*  Isn't it like 90.
*  What was it again Jamie.
*  Fucking.
*  I know.
*  I know.
*  Everywhere.
*  The problem everywhere.
*  It's like the way America work was.
*  It's like there's a moral framework.
*  Louie had a great joke about it where it's he was talking about himself.
*  He's like I have all sorts of ethics and standards.
*  I don't I don't follow any of them but I have them.
*  Like I have standards for myself.
*  And America that the game was that we would look at this.
*  There's seven countries.
*  Yeah.
*  Military bases in at least 80 countries.
*  That's so crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  The number maybe even higher is not all data is published by the Pentagon.
*  But Joe Joe we're American.
*  It's good.
*  This is better off than China.
*  Well that's what I mean.
*  Like yeah it's better off than the game we always play was like yeah we do shit.
*  You can't.
*  Well we're now everything's transparent or it's like significantly more transparent.
*  So and people have no tolerance for hypocrisy.
*  Right.
*  It used to just kind of be like side papers you go like America is kind of a fucking
*  hypocritical.
*  And now because social media it's like I gotcha.
*  It's like yeah fucking we're hypocrites.
*  Yeah.
*  Well that always leads me back to that Smedly Butler paper that he wrote in 1933 which is
*  war is a racket.
*  He was this famous military man who upon retiring reflected upon his career and said
*  like the whole thing was a racket.
*  I thought it was protecting people protecting banks.
*  And this is what war really is all about.
*  And that still holds.
*  I mean it's the military industrial complex speech kind of.
*  Exactly.
*  And yeah it's it's the I think the under the the agreement was corruption and then but
*  stability.
*  Yeah.
*  And now it's it's the corruption has been revealed and now it's super unstable.
*  Like now we can see all the corruption and shit feels real and you can't sleep.
*  Yeah.
*  What's better.
*  You know I think the erosion of the confidence of the government in this country is
*  dangerous because people there's there's kids on the street that are saying you know we
*  want to overthrow the United States government and get rid of all the colonizers like what
*  are you talking about.
*  I know but that's if they but they could clip the fuck out of you and show a reason they
*  should be suspicious of the government.
*  I mean like I think whatever the pharmaceutical companies or the NIH or the White House is
*  what you're skeptical.
*  And the problem is I think there's not a problem but like you're skeptical.
*  You know the limits of your skepticism.
*  You know what I mean.
*  Whereas everybody else just goes limitless skepticism.
*  Also I don't trust anything.
*  They're young.
*  They just got out of college.
*  They write no debt.
*  Well they have debt maybe but they don't have any life.
*  Their life has just begun and they want to throw this.
*  This country is corrupt.
*  Let's just burn it all down.
*  And then do what.
*  And then do yes.
*  Do you want to be Saudi Arabia.
*  Where are you going to go.
*  Where are you going to go.
*  There was a basketball coach in the who after the Celtics dynasty after you know Larry Bird
*  Robert Parrish all this stuff and then he was Rick Patina was the coach and they sucked.
*  And he said to the press like Larry Bird ain't walking through that door.
*  And that's how it is with all these kids.
*  It's like there's no better leader.
*  There's no for the women.
*  There's no better men.
*  There's no like this is it.
*  We're going to make do with this.
*  You want you want to help or not.
*  Or you just want to mope.
*  And you want to end.
*  And also everyone's corrupt.
*  And you should be skeptical.
*  But you but to the point where it's like when does when does when does pure skepticism
*  skepticism become chaos.
*  Well I think when can you not believe traffic lights.
*  They get so frustrated at all.
*  They do want to burn it all down but they don't have a solution.
*  They don't have like a working solution of what happens once it gets burned down.
*  What I worry about is I think the government is so inept and I think the the confidence in
*  the government is so low that if something goes sideways it's not going to be like
*  everybody waits for the government to tell us what to do.
*  You can have chaos in the streets just like the George Floyd riots.
*  You're just going to have that all over the place.
*  That's that's the real fear.
*  People with nothing will revolt and guns are everywhere and it could get real sketchy.
*  Yes. And then or you go it's this it's chaos.
*  It's it's 1968 1969.
*  Yeah. Now and then you see cops beating up protesters and you're like all right.
*  This is hard because I'm for the protesters and you know I need order.
*  Yeah. As a human being I would like it's the freedom and safety.
*  It's the it's the two sort of the two things that hang in the balance.
*  And I don't it's funny to hear you say that you get you get anxious at night based on
*  this world because because it's always at night.
*  Yeah. It's always at night when I'm alone with my thoughts because I just realize all
*  the things that could go sideways at any given time with one thing one big thing one big
*  event and it doesn't even have to be an attack.
*  It could be a natural event one natural event and we're fucked one solar flare that takes
*  out the grid. We're fucked.
*  Yeah. And even and to the George Floyd point it's like they shouldn't have fucking killed
*  the guy and people should people can protest police brutality.
*  That's all like the cops were wrong and how they handled that and the protesters.
*  We are a lot.
*  We it's part of our government.
*  It's part of our society.
*  It's part of our constitution.
*  We can. And then it's like defund the police and I'm like no but that now.
*  You had me. We're not.
*  I fucking need cops.
*  Yeah. Need them.
*  You and also but and then all those polls of like low income people are like no we want
*  cops. So the it's the tyranny of the minority thing where there's also the problem with
*  the autopsy.
*  The autopsy of George Floyd showed that he had lethal levels of fentanyl in a system
*  that he was going to die anyway.
*  I heard they I heard they wasn't lethal.
*  What does that mean. I mean I've I've seen things where it wasn't the the the levels of
*  fentanyl were days old and whatever it wasn't.
*  He that's well he had a large heart.
*  He was suffering from all sorts of ailments like cardiovascular ailments and he did have a
*  high level of fentanyl in a system that I think is in the lethal threshold.
*  And then you have this high stress event being arrested also being compressed.
*  Someone's pressing down on your body restricting your breathing and you're you're
*  panicking you're freaking out.
*  Very possible. Yeah.
*  OK. But I but I don't.
*  So maybe by himself he wouldn't have had.
*  Right. So you're of the mind maybe that he was he had fentanyl in system and it was not
*  great police procedure.
*  It was 100 percent not great police procedure.
*  Yeah. So 100 percent.
*  But also that guy had a history of abuse.
*  Yeah. No but that's what I mean.
*  So then people protest etc.
*  It's like. But the question is did he actually kill that guy or was that guy dying.
*  You know what I think.
*  I think find out because I had read that when they did the initial autopsy they didn't
*  find that his death was because of constriction.
*  It wasn't because of compressed arteries or any of that.
*  You know what I fear happens a lot.
*  Is this a good example.
*  So you like so we go.
*  Yeah. No of course.
*  So you you're of the mind I'm of the mind of like that was wrong.
*  And then you go yes but he did have fentanyl.
*  No I'm of the mind that that was wrong too.
*  That that's police brutality and abuse and probably not necessary.
*  Like it wasn't like he was thrashing and trying to attack like you could have restrained
*  that guy cuffed him and that would have been it.
*  Right. So my point is so it's not but he but he was on fentanyl.
*  Let's say that was awful police work and he was on fentanyl.
*  Right. Right.
*  So let's say the police work was good and the guy wound up dying.
*  That's different. Yeah.
*  Right. Then you say oh he died of a fentanyl overdose.
*  But if you look at the way they handled them it was humane.
*  It was correct.
*  Yeah. Now would there have been pro.
*  Who knows. Now it's probably historically right.
*  That happens all the time.
*  What I worry though get arrested and they die of overdoses.
*  That happens. Yeah.
*  But then you could use Narcon.
*  You can. Yeah.
*  Sometimes they don't you know there's like you've read that where it's like sometimes they
*  just go like fuck it.
*  They I've saved this guy too many times.
*  You know what I mean.
*  Like it's just cops being like fuck I'm so sick of saving drug addicts all day.
*  Right. Like people that don't even seem to want to live.
*  So what I worry that's happening culturally and it literally pick an issue.
*  Israel covid George Floyd whatever is there's these contradictory not even
*  contradictory piece of information.
*  It's not a simple narrative.
*  Right. Right. So I think a lot of times people just declare a mistrial in their
*  head. They go fuck it.
*  I don't. This is somebody's lying.
*  I'm getting the fuck out of here.
*  There is no there's no justice.
*  There's just everything's everything's too gray.
*  Whereas 30 40 years ago it would have been they just killed a guy.
*  I know there's no video.
*  Well there's there's there's like black and white like Kent State.
*  Yeah. That's black and white one.
*  The National Guard comes in shoots protesters.
*  Everybody's outraged.
*  It's horrible.
*  Yeah. There are.
*  But now it's Kent State happens today.
*  Maybe they actually wanted there's a second video.
*  It becomes it's almost like the Kennedy assassination.
*  Everything's kind of the Kennedy assassination and where it is a lot of
*  content and then people go fuck it.
*  I don't know what happened.
*  And I think that's where not even sometimes maybe it's nefarious actors and
*  other times it's just people who want to be contrary or whatever.
*  There's so much information and there's a limited bandwidth for people's
*  attention span and time in a day that they just go I don't know what fucking
*  happened. That's a big one.
*  And that's that's the thing with boomers like you know RFKs talked about this a
*  lot that boomers only pay attention to legacy media and that they really they
*  they're not reading independent journals reports and I don't do you think it's
*  less so though.
*  Like meaning like it's a lot of Facebook links to sort of shifty websites.
*  Some people now.
*  Yeah I think there's some some of that now but I think there's still a lot of
*  people that just put their faith in mainstream especially people that aren't
*  online on a regular basis or they're only friends with people that are their
*  age and so they have this sort of like mentality the way they consume news and
*  information.
*  It's kind of always been the same.
*  Yeah like covid again.
*  I'm sorry to bring this up for the listeners and myself but so there was the
*  tachycardia thing and they put the heart rate thing that was like people it was
*  elevating people's heart like that was one of the main side effects right and
*  they they acted like it wasn't much and then fairly recently there was like
*  actually there was more than we thought.
*  I wonder but then I've also heard from people that are skeptical was like it's a
*  pretty good vaccine in terms of like lowering numbers of infections and but I
*  think most people got the first wave of like you have to take this.
*  This is a perfect vaccine and then they heard this thing of like it's not perfect
*  and then they they got tired.
*  Well it's been lied to from the very beginning.
*  One first thing they didn't even test it to see if it stops transmission but yet
*  they said it did.
*  They didn't even test it to see if it stops you from being infected but yet they
*  said it does.
*  All it does is impart some form of immunity that's specific to the wild virus.
*  The first version.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And the way they studied it and the way they tested it is so fucking corrupt.
*  Just the fact that they said that it's 100 percent effective against stopping
*  death.
*  Do you know how they they came up with that number.
*  Two people in the control group got covid and died.
*  One person in the vaccine group got covid and died.
*  So that makes it.
*  Well there it is.
*  Like when RFK told me that I'm like there's no way that's it.
*  Yeah.
*  Then we read the actual studies and like oh my god that actually is it.
*  Yeah.
*  And they're allowed to say that.
*  Yeah.
*  Technically it's technically true.
*  Technically true.
*  Yeah.
*  Technically you can get away with a lot but it's also like the VAERS system.
*  I mean the reporting of adverse effects is very underutilized.
*  And so we all know people that have had bad side effects from the vaccine.
*  And the question is how many of them kept their mouth shut.
*  How many of them are quiet.
*  How many of them are suffering.
*  How many of them the doctors are unwilling to connect it to the vaccine.
*  There's there's a lot.
*  There's a lot.
*  I personally know more.
*  Well again it's all fucking empirical.
*  So who gives a shit.
*  It's like I well I happen to know who gives a shit.
*  One got one person.
*  But yeah but I wonder what the way forward is with any of this stuff because that
*  thing of people just going fuck it.
*  I declare a mistrial.
*  Yeah.
*  You just it.
*  That's probably not great for society.
*  Did you find anything about George Floyd's toxicology.
*  Yeah I'm looking.
*  I mean I'll just show you what I'm fine.
*  OK.
*  I believe this is the autopsy report.
*  It shows that there was 11 nanograms per milliliter right.
*  Right.
*  No idea if that's high or not.
*  So then what's lethal.
*  Tried to tie 10 to 20.
*  This is what Google says is lethal for humans.
*  Lethal dose is 2.
*  No.
*  Recommend serum concentration is 1 to 20 nanograms per milliliter for anesthesia and 10 to 20
*  milligrams per liter.
*  So blood concentration.
*  What's that doing in the anesthesia range.
*  He had in a system.
*  So what is what's what's lethal.
*  That's right here.
*  Lethal dose is 2 milligrams.
*  So he had nanograms.
*  So he had 11 nanograms which is significantly lower than 2 milligrams.
*  Is that what they're saying.
*  That's what that says.
*  Yeah.
*  But your fentanyl was 5.6 nanograms per milliliter.
*  So did it say that he had a leak cocaine caffeine.
*  He had caffeine.
*  Oh not even cocaine.
*  Cotonene.
*  I was looking through it to find out what it says is like the conclusion.
*  Eleven hydroxy delta 9.
*  So you had bullshit THC in him.
*  He had that fake THC.
*  Right.
*  I know.
*  But that's one of you know 15 years ago that would have been the lead story.
*  Yeah.
*  Negative for ethanol methanol isopropanol and acetone methamphetamine 19 nanograms
*  per milliliter.
*  So he had a lot of shit in his system.
*  Yeah.
*  But but but and so that's like but he doesn't deserve to die.
*  No it may or may not have contributed to his death.
*  It's like shit that you can't prove.
*  But once that's in the air it creates this sense of like we'll never know what happened.
*  And you're like no.
*  The video.
*  Yeah.
*  You see him saying I can't breathe.
*  Yeah.
*  You see the whole thing.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's and what I just worry about this sort of haze of all this shit now of everything.
*  Does any study say that he had a lethal amount of fentanyl in the system.
*  Why do people keep repeating that.
*  All I was seeing that was a bunch of people saying that and they were like I know and
*  that's and you're not you're not repeating it malevolently.
*  You just heard it repeatedly.
*  Well you know what I mean.
*  You're not you're not trying to make the guy look bad or whatever it's just.
*  But a lot of people are.
*  I agree they made that documentary.
*  What documentary.
*  There was a whole documentary about it and then that got debunked about George Floyd.
*  And what does the documentary say.
*  All the fentanyl and all that stuff.
*  No evidence drug overdose was the main cause of death for George Floyd.
*  So this is from what year.
*  2022.
*  So social media users make a claim that George Floyd killed actually died from drug over
*  that these claims are misleading official medical and court records ruled the police
*  restraint not drug use is the main cause of death and evidence support claim that George
*  Floyd lethal die low levels of drugs in the system.
*  One Twitter users sharing the claim George Floyd died of fentanyl overdose.
*  Derek Chauvin should be freed.
*  OK but this is when they like one.
*  No this is one person said but if they're if they're saying like it didn't whatever or
*  can we trust the AP.
*  Yeah that's the thing.
*  However no publicly available evidence supports the claim that Floyd died from overdosing
*  on drugs specifically fentanyl or methamphetamine rather than the actions of the cops.
*  What's that. I assume those are like Russian trolls.
*  Right. But that's my point is like what like this is the world now.
*  Right. You're not you're not you.
*  You are not predisposed to.
*  But there is a thing of being predisposed to skepticism.
*  Right. Right. And it and it seems cooler than being some square ass.
*  Right. I take I'm a sheeple and I don't.
*  And what I'm saying is like there's there's a value in both.
*  You know what I mean. And like I don't know how to I don't know how to litigate it.
*  I don't know how to prescribe it to people.
*  But but and I also know that people have a limited amount of time.
*  That's a giant factor.
*  Yeah. And they got better shit to do.
*  This is not their number one priority.
*  And and and so I don't know what to I truly don't know what that's the kind of thing that
*  would cause me anxiety.
*  I mean if you look at me looking for a new thing to be.
*  But honestly like and you're the thing with you is like because I've known you so long
*  is like you're a decent honest person.
*  I know I will say I will testify in court that any chance I've seen you have to be
*  decent and honest you've taken it.
*  And there's still stuff that you think might be true because it's fucking floating
*  around. Yeah. And you're intelligent.
*  You like but this one I haven't looked into this one I've just heard.
*  That's why I brought it up. Yeah.
*  Yeah. I want to know what the actual I've not read about it honestly.
*  And I remember reading a headline saying that he had a lethal dose right.
*  That's all in the system and that people are arguing it.
*  Yeah. And but it still doesn't take away from the fact that the policing was immoral.
*  Fucking awful. Yeah.
*  And that's that's the thing that people have to deal with every day from the cops.
*  And also being a fucking cop is a horrible.
*  I know everything is so many fucking and it's the worst job on earth.
*  It's one of the worst jobs.
*  I can't. It's a nightmare.
*  You're the professional enemy and everyone you pull over is probably lying to you.
*  Yes. And and they and then they all train with like that everyone wants to shoot
*  them. They kind of have to train that way.
*  Like they have to like just get just get home to your wife and kids.
*  Then they show videos of like them getting ambushed and shit like which isn't false.
*  It's like they do get ambushed.
*  It's not very out but they can't worry about that.
*  It's like we have to worry about hecklers pretty much every show.
*  You know what I mean? Like like so they're all it's all these like very, very complicated
*  things. Very complicated.
*  And I don't know.
*  I think that there and every every point of view has validity.
*  You know a lot of them do.
*  Yeah that's for sure. And then and then you have the foreign actors and you have the
*  disinformation campaigns that are state run that we run.
*  That's for sure too.
*  Yeah. And we do it to other countries.
*  But don't you fucking do it.
*  We do way worse. We actually go in and overthrow their governments install puppet dictators.
*  So we do. We've been doing that forever.
*  We run bullshit democracies.
*  We've caused you know Liberty become a failed state.
*  We've done a lot of wild shit.
*  Yeah. We still continue to do it right now with those 700 plus bases worldwide.
*  Yeah. We're involved in all kinds of shady things.
*  And then there's also the obligation like if you're in the CIA or if you're but shady shit that
*  benefits you and me. Yeah.
*  Not that shady shady shit that undermines legitimate dictators like how do you what do you do.
*  Just let these people develop nuclear arms and take over countries.
*  And no you got to you got to do things to stop despots.
*  I know. And that's the thing of now in the age of transparency and gotcha.
*  You're a hit. You're you are you're you're your government is hugely hypocritical.
*  It's like yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's a fucking government.
*  What do you think we have to be.
*  It's one set of rules for us and another for everybody else.
*  Sorry. Why. Why.
*  That's why you're all trying to sneak in here.
*  What gives you anxiety.
*  Well I would this because I come and give updates on my mental health.
*  How are you doing. I'm doing great.
*  This is what I want to talk to you about. So so all the ayahuasca set a really nice got me off
*  antidepressants got me believing in God in a in a central creation force that's non not a gender
*  whatever. It's just a thing.
*  It's just a magnet basically.
*  It's a woman. Yeah.
*  Yeah please.
*  Wrong podcast. Yeah.
*  The. And then I.
*  And then the DMT broke me.
*  And put me back together and after the DMT the five MEO that I smoked it was a year and a half of I
*  thought it was eight months of chaos and then I did an ayahuasca ceremony a year and a half after I'd
*  smoked the DMT it was the first time back and I felt the DMT door close and I was like it was open
*  that whole fucking time.
*  What do you mean by that.
*  OK. So DMT opened up my brain too much.
*  Little too much open borders.
*  I was I was experiencing too much of the universe.
*  I believe like most of being a human being is just like this.
*  You have we understand that we're a rock in space but we're just like my fucking house and my
*  apartment and my car and my fucking the things that I understand my family that the DMT made it so I
*  could experience like time a lot more.
*  I talked about it last time where I had a hard time watching the screensaver on Apple TV the
*  mountain ranges and shit.
*  I was I got a sense I understood how old they were.
*  In a way you're kind of not supposed to.
*  When you know when someone goes hey can you believe the mountain the Rocky Mountains are seven
*  hundred thousand years old.
*  And you go yeah that's crazy but nothing nothing happens.
*  I kind of understood how long a time that was.
*  I was like way out.
*  I was way out and then I slowly kind of came back.
*  It took about it took a year and a half.
*  And what was the what was the negative aspects of being way out.
*  It was it was I told somebody I was aiming for God and I missed my stop.
*  And I woke up on a like a moving train with no conductor and go on a million miles an hour.
*  So it was because you were taking in too much information that you hadn't considered before.
*  So it became unmanageable.
*  The DMT.
*  Well I had the Michael Pollan experience where the DMT took me back to took me to when I
*  inhaled it.
*  I went to before the Big Bang and Mike said it on here because I looked it up.
*  I was like where have I heard and I was like that's where I was.
*  And so I so I slowly.
*  The issue was so the DMT was pretty much a DMT 25 minute 35 minute experience of like
*  I was before the Big Bang and my personality sort of kind of came back and I was kind of
*  going like I'm not going to do that anymore.
*  I'm not going to be like petty.
*  I'm not going to be going to be like a virtuous person.
*  I'm just going to be like I'm going to remember this God connection and all that stuff.
*  And then a week later I had a reactivation.
*  A week later.
*  Yeah.
*  You know that thing of like there's a thing which people have DMT reactivations where
*  you flash.
*  Yeah.
*  Basically what the joke of like an acid flashback.
*  I had that for and it's common with smoking DMT.
*  And I had one.
*  So now I'm it's a Sunday in New York.
*  I'm on a coffee date with a woman in this side of my frame.
*  This side is fucking pure whiteness infinite time.
*  It was harrowing.
*  So you saw it.
*  It wasn't like a pure split screen.
*  But it was like energetically kind of a split screen.
*  Was it something that you thought and you felt in your mind or was it something you
*  were experiencing visually.
*  It was.
*  It was.
*  Yeah.
*  I shouldn't say that it was.
*  I couldn't see it see it but it felt felt it.
*  Yeah I felt it.
*  And so I would say that I was split between reality current reality and then this
*  infinity sort of energetically.
*  And was it giving you anxiety.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh I was so disoriented.
*  I had the thought like am I in God's imagination.
*  Shit that's not great to think when you're just in on a Sunday walking around in New
*  York.
*  Yeah especially if you're on a date.
*  I mean come on.
*  And you're just trying to make something happen.
*  Yeah.
*  And like pay attention.
*  My friend of mine said she goes you just seem really preoccupied.
*  Like yeah I had a lot on my plate.
*  Did you watch that Hemingway documentary on PBS.
*  No it's.
*  I recommend it highly.
*  Ken Ken Burns Hemingway black and white pushes and I'm not even a Hemingway fan.
*  There were some passages that are like OK this is amazing but there's a part they
*  showed maybe the Spanish Civil War.
*  He went there.
*  I think it's Spanish Civil War and there's a passage from one of his books where he
*  got shot I believe and he said he explained it as like my spirit came out of my body
*  like a ribbon and then came back in.
*  And I was watching my friend I go hey can we stop real quick because I was like in
*  that world like that.
*  This was the reactivation day and I was like yeah I need to not watch this because I'm
*  in that thing where my spirit can come back and it was like touch and go.
*  I think I made this last time.
*  I would have killed myself but I knew I'd be going into more of it.
*  So it was like real.
*  Difficult like real like on the edge of my sanity.
*  Yeah I would say I don't want to say I don't know what pre psychotic would be like pre
*  diabetic.
*  I feel like I was like that pretty close.
*  Now.
*  Over time I got better every day and you know I got returned to norm but I was.
*  More able to fall in love more generous.
*  I would I'm funnier on stage I get 15 percent more and bigger laughs like because I'm
*  spiritual and people notice it like hey what's different about you on stage is better.
*  This Netflix thing is like my best one because it's just like I'm lighter.
*  I'm just lighter.
*  So that was hard to deal with but after the year and a half passed I'm a better.
*  It's easy to be me it's easier to deal with me.
*  Everything's improved.
*  So then in the last year or so every few months I do MDMA and like in a sort of not
*  necessarily therapeutic environment but like in a with a spiritual bent.
*  What's happened from the ayahuasca and the DMT is when I've done mushrooms it's
*  ayahuasca.
*  It's a God connection or what I perceive as a God connection when I do MDMA now
*  it's a God connection and I've been able to I believe I've been able to change my.
*  I believe I've been able to change my I don't want to say spirit but I think it's
*  synapses whatever however you want to like you know categorize it.
*  Your operating system.
*  Yeah basically you're it's like you get you are you are getting a new you get an
*  update an OS update and you know the thing with updates on computers is the
*  computer goes like sometimes you're awake for these updates you're like I've
*  literally done the joke on ayahuasca like is there any other system you have
*  because this is a little touch and go for me.
*  I appreciate it and I always get so much from it in the long term but in the short
*  term I did ayahuasca in November and there was a point where I went up to the
*  shaman I go hey this is I'm like a little close to God right now.
*  Could you just give me like a nudge because it's very hard to comprehend
*  honestly yeah it's as someone who's sort of experiment in this world like it's
*  you know there are moments that are hard to comprehend and it's it's a hard thing
*  to communicate like it's interesting because I think overall you would say the
*  benefit is worth it but it's a slippery road.
*  Yeah well it's hard it's very hard to do and that's the thing and we talked about
*  this last time about sort of the mainstreaming of all this stuff it's
*  Pandora's box man because there's a lot of people I'm I'm whatever I am a
*  intelligent person an accomplished person and I felt like I was pretty
*  psychotic for a couple days and I would have killed myself if not like that's a
*  pretty that would have been a significant.
*  So you genuinely thought about killing well I didn't have a plan or anything but
*  I was like this is this is on no it was like this is unbearable what I'm in right
*  now we're like I'm on her am I in God's am I who am what a what is this what is
*  any of this what is what is steps walking down steps going why is any of
*  this why am I a person in a whatever got through it better and then the MDMA I've
*  been able to sort of I don't know if you want to do software updates or whatever
*  but it's just made me more I had one that was really great which was I did MDMA
*  and and I was able to you know I'm kind of a grudge holder Irish Catholic etc.
*  one of 10 you get it and I was able to just forgive all of my grudges people
*  easily easily like just easily that's very valuable yeah and so the next day I
*  was like why was I so able to do that yesterday but I was holding those grudges
*  tight the day before and it's because my brain I on the MDMA I had oxytocin
*  dopamine serotonin flowing through me right love hormones love kept kindness
*  chemicals generosity chemicals I was able to do it most of the time I realized
*  I just have cortisol and adrenaline and cortisol adrenaline are organized and
*  they're they're they're judicious there that's the currency is like justice
*  retribution wrong right organize organize punishment kind of like rigid
*  right so I started thinking like I've been what I consider a personality it's
*  just cortisol and adrenaline or what I consider a personality so I just realized
*  like I've I've had a quarter I've been I have a kitchen in my head that makes
*  cortisol sandwiches and I'm just like yeah this is what I like to eat no I
*  don't that's just what it's giving out so I I made a conscious effort to like
*  ignore my first like I now write like don't believe your chemicals just don't
*  believe them like like think beyond them and focus on the sort of the softer
*  chemicals are the more positive ones and I've also been doing a thing that's been
*  like wildly helpful which is I was doing a gratitude checklist just every day I
*  would write like things I'm grateful for and and also not only things I'm grateful
*  for the facts of my life the facts of my life are really good I'm I have three
*  Netflix specials now how many people have that I have X amount of money I
*  done great stuff I have love in my life I've a girl I've my friends I'm
*  respected etc etc so I write it down to remember that I have all these great
*  things of I am living my dream I'm living a lot of people's dream I'm also
*  especially living my dream and but you're my brain was just writing like
*  sci-fi and and of like this person fucking out to get you and they didn't
*  just constant nonsense that was just purely based on chemical so what I found
*  is the more I do so then Rainn Wilson the actor suggested we were talking
*  about Islam praying five times a day and I was like that's kind of the right
*  amount if we're honest right if you want to really keep the software in tune yeah
*  if you want to just remember like hey I'm a vessel for a spirit and did it up
*  so he goes why don't you write in your gratitude checklist five times and I was
*  like fine so I've been doing it I rarely get to five it's at least two or three
*  and every day every couple hours just remembering like what the facts of my
*  life are don't think it's also we have all human beings develop patterns of
*  thinking and they these patterns get like deeply cut these grooves they're
*  easy to fall into and this not trusting your chemicals is essentially like not
*  allowing yourself to go down these patterns of thinking yeah there's a
*  there's a saying that I've read a book called the shallows about what social
*  media does to us but it was you are what you do repeatedly you are what you
*  think repeatedly and we have we all wait at least I do or did for a long time
*  wake up and like start the record and just the monologue that's happening in
*  your head and it's gotten me out of it there are days where I wake up and it
*  doesn't start I'm like confused you know because I'm I don't go instantly
*  and I've just it's made me see my life differently I've like I went out of my
*  way to view my life through the way truer lens I believe do you know I mean
*  like it's true I am objectively all the all the attributes that I list and I'm
*  so fucking lucky you're so fucking lucky to get this experience you're so think
*  about this the thing I would say to people is like spin the wheel eight
*  billion other outcomes of human beings alive right now what are the odds you
*  beat this one yeah this just like the Joe Rogan it like literally the Joe
*  Rogan experience what are the odds you beat it there's no fucking way think
*  about think about your life it's impossible and I'm not even talking
*  about like the popularity all that stuff like that's part of it but think
*  about like having an idea doing it in your in your whatever the basement or
*  garage wherever we used to do the podcast and then it just becomes this
*  what think about and I used to think that life I would always tell myself
*  like life's not fair and then I finally one day had the thought yeah life's not
*  fair Neil no one's life should be as good as yours like I'm so lucky it's
*  unbelievable it's unbelievable I'm like getting choked up talking about it's
*  impossible and and I would argue that most people that hear it hear this are
*  in the same position yeah there's this inclination to focus on negatives this
*  inclination I think it's evolutionary yeah I think it is I think we're we're
*  trained to scan for threats yep I agree and and and I write in my journal like
*  my checklist because I want to masculinize it no no every threats a
*  gift wait a minute is a checklist more masculine yeah than a journal yeah I
*  think it I believe it is really checklist because you have to make sure
*  everything's everything's good and your people the women and children are safe
*  but a diary is feminine oh fuck I'm gonna I'm gonna punch you in the face yeah
*  like and and we're and I and I write almost every day no threats only gifts
*  everything I thought was a threat is just a gift over a longer timeline and
*  you've managed to do this without falling into a cult yeah I don't think
*  that one that not one that I know of I'm not paying dues anywhere I haven't it's
*  just literally keeping it's a it's like an emotional discipline in a weird way
*  it's like it's the same way like working out every day well me being your
*  friend and knowing you for so many years I mean I guess I didn't know you well
*  when I first met you mm-hmm we only knew each other because we worked in the same
*  place yeah at Boston Comedy yeah you were a door guy and I was just a young
*  comedian and we just became friends I didn't know you well but you were always
*  nice to me we're always cool but you were always you had like this tension
*  yeah and I always felt like I had to hug you mm-hmm like even when I saw you
*  when you were doing Chappelle yeah this is amazing look yeah are you happy you
*  don't get it no really I really I was just looking at it all wrong right but
*  you were doing well and I always felt like you it was and sometimes when you
*  have this me against the world thing well it really becomes you against the
*  world because other people feel that too and then they don't want to connect
*  with you they go well I'm in the world they don't trust their emotions to just
*  be relaxed around yeah right so there's a tension and a conflict there and it's
*  like you're you're definitely different now you and you were different the last
*  time I talked to you and you feel maybe even more different now yeah it's but
*  that's right on schedule for what what what I did what happened what unfolded if
*  you want to get super super but it's like even that thing of like you know
*  when I met you in 1991 92 pause right and then flash forward to this yeah I
*  don't know man this shit worked out real good great it did but it's hard to see
*  that when you're in the month especially when you're caught up in your own
*  thoughts well yeah and you're caught up in like I'm late or this I've this is
*  coffee's too hot or like this grievance litany of like you're supposed that you
*  think you're supposed to do it right or it's like even in the age of social
*  media and constant like you're gloating by saying your life's great right right
*  there's that too for this is people a lot of people don't know yeah right well
*  a lot of people do but what have you done what have you done to try to
*  mitigate that shitty life are you doing a checklist no are you have you actively
*  moved towards a more positive way and how do you treat people around you and
*  but with you it's like I would check in on you every now and then we were talk
*  about different things that you were doing like remember one of the first
*  ones you were doing was the ketamine stuff mm-hmm and I was like that is wild
*  but I always felt so bad for you I was like god this guy's just struggling with
*  depression and anxiety and I don't understand it you know it's it the
*  chemical stuff ketamine didn't help the first time it I did it two months ago
*  and it was pretty great but yeah I mean I that's the thing is it's hard to know
*  what's gonna do what and that's with any much as exercise help you I do I have a
*  trainer etc but like I don't I can't I I don't I have too many inputs I don't
*  know what's doing what you know I mean like I don't know what's like oh that's
*  definitely the other thing of like the the validation of a successful comedy
*  launch yeah well that you know really helps yeah I've had a lot of friends
*  were depressed and their careers started doing better and this kind of
*  stopped being depressed I know yeah it's embarrassing yeah but but I was not
*  really I know it makes sense yeah the anxiety of entertainment is first of all
*  there's no clear pattern like go to school get a degree get your PhD do this
*  do that there's not a clear path and you never know if it's going to work out and
*  how many guys have we known especially us like who knew people back in the day
*  that were talented yeah we thought we're going to make it yeah did not and
*  more talented than us and we're better at the time than we are and you go God
*  how do they not make it yeah and that's the thing even when you say are you
*  moving toward are you doing anything to improve your lot in life it's like a lot
*  of people try right and it doesn't work it doesn't work yeah and then you go you
*  know why did it work for you why did it work for me I can take some credit for
*  effort I can't really take credit for talent shit but just came out I don't
*  know I fucking been funny so I was fucking five do you know I mean like I
*  just kind of been myself so I guess I cultivated and I didn't and I was brave
*  I made brave choices it's incredibly fortunate in a time where some comedians
*  have deals with Spotify worth hundreds of millions of dollars like in a time
*  where you can make a ton of money as a comedian or or you know it's like I was
*  think this about athletes I'm sure you have to like a hundred years ago none of
*  the guys none of the you know hundred millionaire athletes are fucking they're
*  all just like good farmers yeah didn't one of the best farmers in the area yeah
*  like what did it mean they're just aggressive in 1910 yeah a great yeah you
*  weren't getting an endorsement deal it's just like you yeah yeah so so we're
*  really lucky we're just lucky in so many ways but I think the whenever I tell
*  people that I was like yeah but you're good too I'm like so what I yes but I
*  don't I can't take credit for that yeah and it's also like everyone's formula
*  for success is different no one can take your formula and just plug it into their
*  life it's like but you have different circumstances you have different hormones
*  you have different everything different life experiences different goals and
*  aspirations different interests you know different mentality it's like it doesn't
*  work that way it's like everyone has to find whatever the formula is but there's
*  certain things that seem to be they seem to exist and gratitude is a big one
*  that's such a hippie unfortunately a co-opted word yeah you talked about with
*  Chris Williamson I think right you guys talked about it it really is like
*  Oprah fide hallmark fide yeah yeah but but real yeah man yeah I think it's just
*  a better way to look it it's just a better way to look and but we're sort of
*  trained to make it like no you did it cuz you ground you grinded and rose
*  when no one else was there all your enemies were asleep and you were doing
*  current whatever yeah yes that's true too that's it also yes it is true but
*  like I said a lot of people do that doesn't work yeah they can't they don't
*  they freeze up when the mic come in whatever they just whatever it is there
*  are you and I both worked hard and are fucking fortunate be I mean I had the
*  thought I I'm so fortunate I there's nothing I can do to compensate for this
*  this level of fortune meaning like there's no level of volunteer work right
*  I could volunteer the rest of my life but you know what you do do you live a
*  life by example and then this conversation is so insanely valuable
*  because there's gonna be millions of people that hear you talk and say these
*  things and those people many of them are gonna get in their mind that there's a
*  pathway out of this maybe I can't take Neil Brennan's pathway but there's a
*  pathway out of this and here's a guy that was like deep dark like I remember
*  running into you in the hallway one time at the comedy store and you just
*  had this look on your face like the fucking the weight of the world was on
*  your shoulders and when I would say hi to you whenever I'd say hi to you I
*  would always almost feel like I gotta give this guy a hug I really felt that
*  yeah like I want to give you a hug yeah like I'm a happy person let me give you
*  a hug see if some of this shit wears off yeah yeah but yeah but you weren't you
*  now you're a different guy now and just by people knowing that even though it
*  doesn't feel like it while it's happening every time someone's in the
*  middle of some shit whatever it is a breakup you get fired whatever it is
*  when you're in the middle of some shit man it doesn't feel like it's ever gonna
*  change it feels like this is life from now on and it's unbearable and I'm fucked
*  and when people hear a guy like you who's not only made it out of there but
*  made like real measurable success like it's it's quantifiable you could see it
*  it's undeniable they go well maybe I can do it too yeah I hope so they can it and
*  it it it it's not easy it's scary but what the fuck is easy yeah you tell me
*  something that's worth doing it's easy yeah what the fuck is easy I don't I
*  don't even like that word I hate that word it's it's just a dumb word easy the
*  easy's not in the menu it's not but valuable well that's why I think that
*  yeah exactly but that's the thing that happens is like because it's not I was
*  gonna say like the easy pass like literally on the freeway like that's
*  easy but even that you got a fucking slow down right even that might find the
*  fucking higher iron someone left on the road yeah like it's not but but it's
*  it's uh it's it is like you said it's worthwhile if it's difficult everything's
*  difficult and that's the thing that you we can fall into this thing of like it's
*  you had to dry you had to take a fucking shower and shave and find a shirt and
*  just it's not effortless but that's part of life and you can't get hung up on the
*  sort of the upkeep part of it well my strategy for that is to self administer
*  things that are far more difficult than anything that I might experience in my
*  day and that's what I do with workouts like workouts for me it's not just a
*  physical thing it's a mental thing as much as if not more than it's a
*  physical thing because I don't want to do it I still want to do it like
*  sometimes I want to do it but most times I don't but I still do it and is it do
*  you have consciously think like I don't want to do this chore for my wife or
*  whatever and then go but you just you just sat in a fucking freezing cold
*  water for 20 minutes you can do a buddy I know just embodied I've done so many
*  difficult things that I'm just comfortable doing difficult things and I
*  know those whispers don't do it take the day off take a nap do this do that I know
*  how to avoid those but I know how to avoid those just because that that's the
*  path that I've carved in my head so my pattern of behavior is always gravitate
*  towards difficult things and just do it you don't want to do and ignore those
*  thoughts and if I can make them so difficult that regular life is easy like
*  if you can fucking do a cold plunge do ten rounds in the bag and then do 20
*  minutes and 195 degrees in a sauna like the rest of the day is gonna be easy
*  yeah it's gonna be is those rounds seven eight nine and ten are so fucking hard
*  you're drenched with sweat you look over the timer five more seconds to rest
*  before the bell goes off if you just get through that man regular life is easier
*  because it's not that hard you couldn't sustain it if regular life for me was
*  like round seven around eight forever I wouldn't want to do that I think for a
*  lot of people you know they got to take the bus to work that is round seven like
*  there are just people that have a higher level of difficulty sure existence I've
*  had those higher levels of difficulty in my life and that's one thing I'm very
*  fortunate for being growing up poor I think is very valuable and it's
*  something I can't give my kids and I think about that I really do because
*  they don't understand the the fear of not having food they don't understand
*  like your parents are on welfare and you know that you're eating from food stamps
*  it's like that fear that that drive like there's no one coming to save you you
*  better go get things done and you have to do it for yourself and if you don't
*  still believe that there's a camp and you could start poverty camp for you for
*  rich kids for rich kids you'd be faking it though they always know that you're
*  going to be there to rescue them that's part of the problem and one of the things
*  that I think can mitigate that is like them choosing difficult paths difficult
*  things to do but it'll definitely not be as difficult as a poor person yeah and
*  that's and that's and like you got out of it yeah and now you're doing you're
*  doing pretty good so it's like I just think it's important that it's important
*  for me to remember I can't prescribe like gratitude will do it I don't know
*  but that's a thing that really helped me I've and plus ketamine trans cranial
*  magnetic stimulation so off DMT ayahuasca mushrooms a MDMA tried a lot of
*  things I've tried a lot of stuff and and I'm and I'm and I'm even fortunate to
*  have added access to a lot of stuff 100% but yeah but the and acknowledging that
*  but this thing of hard work doesn't isn't always an adequate you know it's
*  like it's not enough but it's something it's yeah it's all you can control yeah
*  that's what I write it's like I can't I may I can't be I'll never be grateful
*  enough to for this but I can work hard and I can be focused on the stuff that
*  is and what what's important to me and hopefully it ends up being valuable to
*  people but like I can't I just I don't I I'm I'm I'm people would always go like
*  you're doing so well and did it and I'd be like you don't like you said I'd be
*  like you don't fucking understand stupid this stupid sketch show that's never
*  going anywhere and then and then all these things you look back you're like I
*  should have been so happy yeah yeah yeah and and and or I could have been so
*  happy you know I mean it's an opportunity I think you talk about this
*  is very valuable yeah I really do I'm glad I'm glad you're happy and it's also
*  the thing of like I was going in the I know you're doing a nice wrap-up and
*  you'll have to restart it the thing of like some days I I'd be like I like we
*  all feel stuck in our existence you know and instead of I've I mean again it's so
*  corny but sometimes they're writing my journal I get to be Neil Brennan mmm not
*  I have to be right I get to be Neil Brennan right yeah and that's you get to
*  be a father you get to be a whatever all the things that are like great yeah
*  you're it's not a it's not it's not a threat it's a gift Elon posted something
*  today about or as yesterday that anxiety is essentially conspiracy theories that
*  you make against yourself that's I literally had that same I don't I don't
*  like I thought about it with you and Dave where it's like I don't have I only
*  have conspiracy theories about about why people don't like me well I like you
*  thank you buddy I like you too thank you all right let's wrap this up thank you
*  for being here appreciate you and I really do think what you're saying is
*  very valuable to people and I haven't seen your special yet but I'm sure it's
*  awesome you're hilarious crazy good you know Brennan when you flying out number
*  it's number it was number when you find back tonight tonight I met yeah I was
