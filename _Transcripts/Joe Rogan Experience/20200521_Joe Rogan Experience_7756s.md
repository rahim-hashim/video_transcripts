# Joe Rogan Experience #1478 - Joel Salatin
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [May 21, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-7O3fOXXKo)
*  Good to see you again, sir.
*  Good to be here.
*  Thank you.
*  Thanks for coming back, man.
*  I really appreciate it.
*  This is a perfect time to talk to someone like you about our food.
*  We're in a very strange crisis now, and you just keep hearing time and time again in the
*  news how much ranchers and farmers and people are really suffering right now and how much
*  folks who don't have anything to do with that are now forcing, they're being forced to understand
*  the importance of the food supply chain and ranchers and farmers and all the stuff that
*  we've taken for granted for quite a long time now.
*  Well they sure have, and what's interesting about it is the juxtaposition between the,
*  I'll just call it the industrial, the more commercial industrial food sector versus the
*  sector that I'm in, which is a local centric, direct sale branded product directly from
*  the farm, the pandemic is the best marketing strategy we've ever seen.
*  We're having the best season we've ever had, and the same thing was with farmers around
*  the country as I talked to them.
*  Everyone that's like us that did not go into the supermarket system basically, that's selling
*  in their community, in their region, regionally, directly off the farm, having the best year
*  we've ever had.
*  It is the industrial mega system that's cracking, and so for the first time we're hearing talk
*  of well maybe we need to add resiliency to efficiency.
*  And so yeah, the system that's cracking, there's plenty of food, I mean there's plenty of food
*  on farms being produced, but of course as you know, milk is being dumped, pigs are being
*  euthanized, the problem is not at the farm level, the problem is in the chain of custody
*  between the farmer and the consumer, and primarily in the large scale processing situation.
*  Yeah, these large meat processing places, they've been hit hard by the coronavirus.
*  They have been, I mean if you think about it right now Joe, probably in the United States,
*  the only places right now where every day thousands of people come together in crowded
*  conditions are these big meat processing plants.
*  I mean the offices are closed, the theaters are closed, the convention centers are closed,
*  and so the only place where people are coming shoulder to shoulder, thousands every day
*  are in these mega processing facilities.
*  Patrice and I, my wife, actually co-own a very small abattoir, slaughterhouse, community
*  slaughterhouse, we have 20 employees, and the difference in the vulnerability, in the
*  exposure and risk factor between our little 20 person facility where we do maybe 50 to
*  70 beaves a week, 100 hogs, versus these mega plants that have...
*  When you say beaves?
*  Beaves, like beef.
*  Oh, beefs.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I thought you said beaves.
*  Well, there's no such word as beefs, it's B-E-E-V-E-S.
*  Oh, okay, that is what you're saying.
*  Beaves.
*  Have you heard that before, Jamie?
*  No, okay.
*  So the plural of beef is not beefs, it's beaves.
*  Oh, interesting.
*  I always thought that beef was just the meat.
*  I never thought...
*  I would have assumed you would say cows.
*  Well, as a farmer, cows are females who have had calves.
*  So it's a very...
*  As opposed to steers, who would be...
*  Or bulls, which would be intact males, steers non-intact.
*  So as a farmer, all this nomenclature is real...
*  Yes, normal for you.
*  A theologian teases out Presbyterians and Methodists, and we just say, well, they're
*  Protestants.
*  So...
*  So you have a small place.
*  We do, we do.
*  It's a small facility, and it's been in business for, I don't know, what, 60 years or so.
*  We've only co-owned it now for a little bit less than 10 years.
*  But the difference, because we do stuff by hand, workstations...
*  These stainless steel work tables are, what, six, seven, eight feet wide, three feet to
*  four feet deep.
*  And each one is a workstation.
*  And you've got three guys out on the kill floor.
*  You got two guys out in the cryovac room.
*  You've got four guys in the boning room.
*  You got a guy over here running the sausage stuffer or the grinder.
*  It's inherently small scale, spread out, completely different environment than when you're having
*  3,000 people in a cool, damp environment.
*  And I don't want to get into a rabbit trail discussion, but frankly, in these great, great
*  big plants, most of the workers are generally not Americans.
*  They're coming from other countries looking for the American dream.
*  And so they're living in crowded conditions because they're trying to save every penny
*  to send home to get, you know, uncle and aunt and other family members here from Ethiopia,
*  Somalia, you know, wherever it is.
*  And so they're living in a house that we would live for in a house.
*  They're living, you know, 20.
*  They're eating poorly.
*  They're in a stressful, they're often separated from their family.
*  There's just a lot of stress in their lives.
*  And so then you throw these big processing facilities.
*  They're not eating well.
*  And it's just an incubator.
*  I mean, if you wanted to create an incubator for a virus, there wouldn't be a better place.
*  Whereas small facilities are inherently, the workers are spread out.
*  They tend to come from the community.
*  They tend to be career craft people rather than just, you know, make this cut.
*  Mac.
*  You know, the average poultry processing plant in our area, they say that every job can be
*  learned in 20 minutes.
*  So whereas at our plant, we cross, you know, we cross do, you know, we cut meat a while
*  and then we go pack a while and you're on the cut floor and then you're, you know, you're
*  doing different things.
*  So it's a real different environment.
*  And so these big plants are very vulnerable.
*  And that's why the recalls come from there.
*  The, you know, the microbials come from there.
*  I mean, an average, an average fast food hamburger has pieces of 600 animals in it.
*  Wow. When you get a hamburger from us, it's one animal, you know, so just the sheer
*  whatever mixing, you know.
*  So, you know, for sure, we don't know a lot about this virus.
*  I mean, we're learning every day and, you know, you've got to kind of take a little bit
*  a grain of salt, too.
*  But one of the things we're certainly learning is that there's an advantage that there is
*  a density factor, a people density factor, like an urban rural, you know, spreading out
*  the whole social distancing, spreading out thing is seems to be a valuable thing.
*  And so if we take that into the food system, wouldn't it be an amazing thing if instead
*  of having 150 to 200 mega processing facilities doing 98 percent of the nation's meat,
*  if instead that were 200,000 small scale, community based, ecologically nested facilities,
*  you know, all around the countryside.
*  That would be an incredibly resilient system.
*  It sounds like a much better system, like as you were talking before about your relationship
*  with your customers, it's a direct to farm.
*  I mean, that's really ideal, right?
*  Cut out the middle person.
*  There's you cut out the confusion whether or not the animals are ethically raised or
*  ethically slaughtered, like what are the conditions they're living under?
*  I mean, you're poly face farms, right?
*  So that that whole video that you have that I've seen that explains the way you do regenerative
*  farming and you let these animals live the way these animals are supposed to live.
*  They're not confined to cages.
*  They're roaming around.
*  They're eating natural foods and you get a better product, you get a healthier product
*  and you get a better relationship with both the animals and the people that you sell this
*  this food to.
*  Well, sure.
*  And and ultimately what we're looking for is a habitat that allows each life form, whether
*  it's a plant or an animal, to fully express when we call it, you know, expressing the
*  pigness of the pig or the chickenness of the chicken.
*  You can say the tomato of the tomato, you know, and and creating a habitat that allows
*  that life, that life to express its, you know, its its
*  phenotypical and physiological distinctiveness in humans, we would call this self-affirmation.
*  You know, the the the the Tomness of Tom, the Jonas of Joe, right?
*  It's that affirmation.
*  And and one of the things that we're seeing as a result, as we move into the kind of the
*  social consequences of this whole pandemic is a
*  is what there's there's a new phrase called the screen new deal where everything is going
*  to AI. We're going to, you know, we're dehumanizing.
*  And so at a very time when people need to be personally affirmed, they're being denied
*  their, you know, their their social humanity element.
*  I mean, you can't even see whether a person smiling or frowning.
*  Yeah. Yeah, that's the worst part about this other than the tragedies.
*  The worst part about this is that like people aren't getting hugged.
*  People are scared to shake hands.
*  Everyone's separated from everybody.
*  It's just very strange.
*  It is it is. And and, you know, our our our personal energy that we get from each other,
*  you know, like you, I'm sure I've done numerous zoom things lately more than ever.
*  Zoom conferences, zoom phone conferences, different things.
*  And there's just not the energy.
*  There's just there's just not you just don't get the energy that you get when you're
*  right in front of each other. Yeah, absolutely.
*  I feel the same way about podcasts.
*  And, you know, Jamie, I screwed up.
*  I forgot the nurse.
*  We started early. Yeah.
*  You can pause and stop. Can we?
*  I mean, yeah, OK.
*  We're going to we want to give you a coronavirus test.
*  OK. You're down with that. That's fine.
*  I will pause right here. OK.
*  So we did you a little test and found out you have not had it.
*  You didn't fight it off. Bummer.
*  But the doctor did explain to us that there is primary immune system
*  and their secondary immune system, your primary immune system,
*  most likely if you've been in contact with it and his has, you know, his he's
*  the doctor has been around many, many people that have had it.
*  But your primary immune system, if you're healthy, he was saying, fights it off.
*  Your secondary immune system is if you have had it,
*  the infection in your body has developed those antibodies.
*  It's your second line of defense.
*  So most likely your first line of defense, since you have been in contact
*  with people that have had it, your first line of defense beat it.
*  Well, that's cool. Yeah.
*  Well, I work on it.
*  Yeah, we were talking about that.
*  And I said, please save this because it's so crazy.
*  You drink. Explain what you do.
*  Yes. Strengthen your system.
*  So, you know, in this whole thing, like you, I've been I've been screaming.
*  Let's talk about the immune system.
*  Yes. So so I literally I literally have not been sick
*  a day, basically in 20 years.
*  I mean, not the flu, not a cold, not I mean, just nothing.
*  And and I'm 60, 63.
*  So I'm not saying that arrogantly or proudly.
*  I'm saying it gratefully that that I think there are things that we can do
*  to really build up our immune system.
*  One of the things that I do that kind of makes all my staff laugh
*  is that I routinely bend down with the cows and drink the drink
*  water out of the cow tank.
*  I don't drink it when it's pond water, although I've drunk pond water.
*  But when it's, you know, when it's when it's like well water,
*  you know, when it's fairly clean water, I get down.
*  Of course, you know, the cows are dripping saliva and stuff in it,
*  you know, and I just drink right out of it, just like a cow.
*  And I'm serious.
*  You know, I believe that that that
*  what it builds your microbiome, you know, I want all those bugs, all that diversity.
*  We we live in the most amazing
*  microscopic soup.
*  I mean, it's just it's a soup.
*  If you could take an electromagnetic photograph of of the air
*  of where we are, I mean, the very I mean, our skin is exuding stuff.
*  You know, our noses are our
*  clothes, everything.
*  We're it would look like a it would look like the the cloud over
*  pig pen in the Peanuts comic strip.
*  You know, I mean, that's literally what we're living in.
*  And and and all of this life, all of you know,
*  bacteria, viruses, bacteria, microorganisms,
*  all of this life is is literally having a conversation.
*  Hey, you know, I like to hook onto you in a symbiotic relationship.
*  Hey, man, I'm a parasite. I'm will take you down.
*  You know, it's like it's like a drama.
*  It's like a play that's going on inside of us, outside of us.
*  And the thought that we can somehow whatever, you know,
*  isolate ourselves and and and extract ourselves.
*  From this from this magnificent life conversation
*  that's going on in us on our skin, our clothes, our hair, our eyes.
*  Is is it's just silly.
*  And it's part of how our immune system works.
*  You know, our immune system actually, I need your bugs.
*  My immune system needs your bugs.
*  Your immune system needs my bugs.
*  And and so now,
*  does that mean we all run into the nursing homes, you know, and take vulnerable?
*  No, no, no.
*  There, I mean, there are there are certainly people that are very vulnerable.
*  So we want to be careful there. All right.
*  I get that.
*  But for the for the rest of us that are generally healthy,
*  going about our daily stuff, I mean, goodness, worry,
*  worry affects your cortisol limits almost more than anything.
*  Worry. You know, I got on a plane yesterday to come out here.
*  And thanks for the nice business class ticket, by the way.
*  You're welcome. And and the lady sitting in front of me.
*  So we're in business class.
*  I'm sitting.
*  So there's four, there's an aisle and there's two seats on either side.
*  And so I sit down, there's nobody next to me.
*  I'm in next to the window.
*  A lady in front of me is on the aisle.
*  So she's a little bit diagonal for me in front.
*  A guy sits across from her on the aisle,
*  on the opposing aisle, and she asks him to move over to the window.
*  And and I'm just watching this play out.
*  Of course, I'm trying to, you know, keep my glasses from fogging up
*  with my mask and my face, you know, and I'm thinking.
*  That she's worried, she's fearful.
*  What have we done to ourselves as a culture that every single person
*  we come in contact with is a.
*  Might be my killer, you know, I mean, that's a that's a horrible.
*  And so what does that do to our cortisol?
*  Boom, you know, and suddenly our immune system is.
*  Whatever compromised because we're living in this in this fear all the time.
*  I think one of the things you said, though,
*  when you said most of us that are healthy, I think that's
*  not really true.
*  I think most of us are not healthy.
*  And I think that's one of the things we're finding out from this crisis.
*  Yes. Is that when you talk about protecting vulnerable people,
*  there's a lot of us that are vulnerable, maybe not you or me. Right.
*  But a large number of people that are overweight, that eat poor food
*  and that don't take care of themselves.
*  And those people are particularly vulnerable.
*  And so they're right to be afraid, but they're wrong to think that this
*  the only way to solve this is to make sure that you stay away from everybody.
*  The way to solve this is to stop eating shit and become a healthy person.
*  It's while you're alive.
*  There's always a there's a moment, a chance to be healthier while you're alive.
*  If you're alive and you're not terribly ill and dying,
*  you could start drinking water, stop drinking soda, stop eating chips,
*  starting fruits and vegetables, starting lean meats, healthy foods,
*  not even lean meats. Eat a good rib eye steak.
*  Pastured, pastured meats.
*  Yeah. Eat food. Yeah, you're right.
*  Well, you know, whenever I watch a newscast and watch the, you know, the daily
*  like, you know, coronavirus briefing from the White House. Right.
*  And you've got all these experts standing around and and everybody's standing
*  there waiting for this magic vaccine.
*  And of course, you know, the CDC gets four point six billion dollars a year
*  selling vaccines. They have whatever 20 patent vaccines.
*  And so really, the CDC is a very vested interest in trying to develop a vaccine.
*  There's there's a lot of money in sickness.
*  There's a lot of money in sickness.
*  And so so, you know, we didn't get this this coronavirus
*  because of a lack of vaccine.
*  We got this coronavirus because something
*  in this in this beautiful life
*  bath that I described was out of whack.
*  That's that now, you know, we can we can
*  start discussing where it possibly came from.
*  I think right now that's conjecture.
*  I mean, I think we do know that it came out of Wuhan, but but
*  just how we were, I mean, we're not sure.
*  But the fact is that there was an imbalance in life.
*  And just like in your and in our lifetime, Joe, we've learned
*  to say words that when I was a child, did you ever hear of the term,
*  you know, Salmonella E coli, Campylobacter,
*  bovine spongiform encephalopathy,
*  food allergy even?
*  I mean, how many kids at elementary school did you know they had food allergies?
*  None, none. Nobody.
*  You have a birthday party.
*  Mom isn't having to email.
*  We didn't have email back then.
*  But mom isn't calling all the other mothers saying, well, now,
*  what can your child eat and what can what can your little Mary have?
*  And, you know, oh, oh, we might not have any peanuts.
*  And I mean, that didn't exist.
*  And what's happened?
*  The way I look at this is that that humanity,
*  that we as collective humanity,
*  we've essentially taken this this beautiful, benevolent earth, this benevolent
*  sustainer, partner, mentor, abundant provider.
*  And taken it, taken this partner to the boxing ring.
*  And instead of caressing this abundant, wonderful partner provider,
*  we've pummeled it and pummeled it.
*  We've we've we've pulled the water out of its aquifers.
*  We've we've destroyed its soil.
*  We've we've put a dead zone the size of the Rhode Island in the Gulf of Mexico.
*  We've we've we've used antibiotics in animals and made Mercer
*  and C.Diff and superbugs.
*  And and and and so nature has been gently, gently
*  begging for for relief as we've essentially, you know, put our foot,
*  put our foot on her neck. Right.
*  And she and she's saying,
*  E. coli, salmonella, you know, bovine spongiform and cephalopathy. Right.
*  And including diabetes and, you know, all these other things.
*  And we simply don't listen and continue to pummel.
*  And eventually, eventually, when our our benevolent nest,
*  whatever, you know, is KO'd,
*  we find out. Oops.
*  Maybe we should have paid attention.
*  Yeah. And I think a real parallel is when you were talking about
*  these large scale meat processing plants
*  are a perfect sort of petri dish for viruses to grow.
*  So are factory farms.
*  So are these farms where you're stuffing pigs next to each other.
*  You're doing all this unnatural stuff, right?
*  It's unnatural for people to be stuffed into a warehouse
*  right next to each other, shoulder to shoulder, working all day.
*  It's unnatural for them to be stuffed in these homes, shoulder to shoulder
*  with bad food and all the things that you would need to keep your body healthy
*  and strong.
*  The same can be said about these factory farm situations.
*  One thing that I find so attractive about the way you run your farm
*  is that there's no weirdness in watching these animals during the day.
*  They seem like animals just doing normal stuff.
*  If you see a chicken wandering around, just pecking at the grass, looks normal.
*  See a chicken in a cage getting fed out of a little cup or something.
*  It looks all kinds of fucked up, right?
*  It doesn't feel right.
*  That's why we have the phrase
*  respecting the pigness of the pig and the chickenness of the chicken.
*  And we know that these diseases are all coming from these places.
*  I mean, there's a ton of agricultural diseases
*  that are based from these factory farm situations where these animals live
*  in these really horrific conditions.
*  And then the bacteria jump.
*  Look, I mean, they're there.
*  Look, if you ate in your toilet every day, would you like to eat your toilet every day?
*  Right. That's that's how they eat.
*  You're they're breathing in their fecal particulate matter, which is,
*  you know, putting lesions in their tender respiratory membranes,
*  making making lesions there.
*  And so when you have those kinds of conditions
*  and they're not getting exercise or not getting fresh air.
*  And so I mean, the the they're not getting salad.
*  They're not getting any vitamin D from the sunshine.
*  And so what happens is you get an extremely
*  concentrated host host facility for pathogenicity.
*  That's what happens. You get a very concentrated host facility
*  because there's always a host.
*  They're close to each other.
*  The pathogen doesn't have to say, wow, boy, I wonder if I can make it that,
*  you know, that half mile over to another.
*  No, you know, they're always right there.
*  And so you're right. It's like it's like an incubator.
*  And so, you know, if we wanted to sit down, look, if we wanted to sit down and say,
*  let's say we had a James Bond conspiratist, you know,
*  and said, we're going to form a committee and and make a pathogen friendly farm.
*  You know, the old James Bond nemesis. Right.
*  And so we form a committee say, how can we make a pathogen friendly farm?
*  Well, we would have only one species.
*  We'd crowd it up. We'd take out the oxygen, the the fresh air, the sunshine.
*  We'd give it we'd give it a minimal, a minimalistic diet.
*  What I've just described is modern, efficient industrial factory farming.
*  You couldn't design a better system
*  for for conductivity of pathogenicity.
*  Now, here's the big question.
*  Is it possible to feed all of Los Angeles using your methods?
*  Can you can you feed big urban areas using these regenerative methods?
*  Sure. Absolutely.
*  So so so two things to realize is the the bottleneck in the food system right now.
*  The reason the supermarket is low on meat is not because there aren't animals in the field.
*  It's because of the the processing is the it's not the trucking.
*  It's not the production.
*  It's not even the it's not even the store shelf.
*  It's it's the processing.
*  So it's the processing that's the bottleneck.
*  And so so so my vision is that
*  so so so we get to two questions.
*  First of all, let's deal with the production with the production.
*  Absolutely. If we if we spread out the production, if we if we did, for example,
*  you know, if we took all the confinement chicken houses
*  and put those chickens on pasture.
*  No problem. OK, it doesn't take any more land
*  to grow the feed for a chicken on pasture than it does in a confinement house.
*  Don't you get a lot more loss, though, due to raptors and things on those lines?
*  No, no, no. We put it we put them in in little protected shelters.
*  Then we move them every day across the pasture.
*  Well, yeah, you can get losses from from raptors, but we use guard geese.
*  They're guard dogs, guard llamas.
*  There's all sorts of guard animals.
*  There's there's really cool.
*  And there's and there's a lot of research being done
*  to jam the radar of, you know, eagles and stuff there.
*  I mean, really? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
*  They jam the rate. I didn't even know they had radar.
*  Well, that's figurative. Right.
*  What are they using when they when when an eagle is just not just their vision's
*  insanely good, right? Yeah.
*  Eagles in particular. It really is. It really is.
*  And so, for example, I know one guy that's he's it's not it's not ready to sell yet,
*  but he claims to have had great success
*  putting reflective
*  Coke can bottoms on like a traffic cone,
*  hanging it out with his chickens and that splays the sun rays all out
*  and messes up the eyesight of the of the eagles and the hawks.
*  They can't zero in. Really?
*  Yeah. In fact, this was exactly
*  one of the defensive measures the US Navy used
*  and still uses for incoming missiles that they they
*  they have a cannon that blows out pieces of aluminum foil, basically,
*  and like a graffiti aluminum foil graffiti out in the air.
*  And it jams the whatever the, you know, the the honing devices of a missile.
*  The hawks are the same way.
*  What I'm getting at is that there there are
*  we don't lose very much. We protect them greatly.
*  There are a lot of things that you can do to, you know, to mitigate that kind of pressure.
*  But but the fact is the industry loses tons of birds, too,
*  in a flood, in a heat wave, in a whatever, you know.
*  And and so the idea that these birds in this big confinement house
*  are actually protected from malady.
*  This is simply not is simply not good.
*  And they're going to be much more of them are going to get sick.
*  Sure. Sure. They might have losses in that way.
*  Sure. Sure. So so can we produce can we produce the food this way?
*  Absolutely. Now, one of the things that it would require
*  is many more people on farms.
*  So, you know, I've thought a lot about
*  obviously as unemployment has skyrocketed through this.
*  Right now, sitting here, it's hard for us to imagine what it'll take to bring,
*  you know, to fill football stadiums again, to fill Caribbean cruises, to fill theaters,
*  you know, music venues, you know,
*  whatever, boxing matches.
*  I mean, right now, it's hard to conceive what it'll take.
*  People are so terrified.
*  It's hard to appreciate how much of this is going to come back,
*  the hospitality industry and all that.
*  So so so what's going to happen?
*  So so where are the jobs? What are people going to do?
*  And and I would suggest that one of the things that that people can do
*  is that we can have a lot of these smaller plants
*  and we have way more people actually doing the jobs.
*  And we have way more people actually growing food,
*  participating in food production personally.
*  Is food going to be more expensive? Maybe so.
*  But you get to be healthy and we have a healthy planet.
*  And what's that worth?
*  How much more do you think it would cost for?
*  I mean, if you just give a rough percentage,
*  if you're thinking about food production right now with the current situation,
*  there's a lot of automation, right?
*  A lot of these factory farms, they don't require too many people to be working.
*  They require much more people.
*  You'd have to manage these animals.
*  You'd have to do it sort of along the lines of the way that you do.
*  Yeah. How many more people you think would be involved in a large scale farm?
*  Lots, lots of people.
*  I don't have I don't have a number there, but I can tell you that that prices would,
*  you know, food prices might go up to what they were 30 years ago.
*  And it also would it be fair to say that food prices might go to where they should be?
*  A cheeseburger really shouldn't be ninety nine cents.
*  No, no, absolutely.
*  As you're very familiar with the argument of the externalized costs,
*  they don't they don't get captured.
*  What's what's the cost?
*  Right now, 50 percent of the cases of diarrhea in the US are caused by foodborne bacteria.
*  Well, what's a what's a case of diarrhea worth?
*  Yeah. If we start if you start. Yeah, that's a good point.
*  If you start putting dollars on these externalized costs, you know,
*  the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico, the fact that we have, you know,
*  hundreds of square miles that don't grow shrimp anymore, you know,
*  because it's toxic from the runoff from the Mississippi from from chemical farming.
*  So there's there's a lot of these externalized costs.
*  And not only that, but if this actually became normat,
*  the the whatever the new way, the new orthodoxy,
*  there would be definitely economies of scale that we don't have right now.
*  I mean, I'll just give you one example that probably nobody would think of.
*  So we play we pay workman's compensation at our farm.
*  So how do you determine the exposure level, the risk factor of a poultry worker?
*  I mean, think about if if you have a Tyson chicken farm
*  and you hire an employee to be in the chicken house,
*  think about his workman's comp risk.
*  I mean, there's fecal particulate all day long that he's breathing.
*  You've got augers, chains, feed bins, electrical connections, dust.
*  I mean, it's it's a very it's a high risk situation for us.
*  A poultry worker goes out in the field and
*  move some move some chickens in a field.
*  There's no fecal particulate.
*  There's no dust. There's no, you know, there's no augers.
*  There's no whatever spinning fans, vent shafts.
*  You know, there's none of this.
*  And so so part of the cost,
*  the reason that our chicken is more expensive than what's in the store
*  is not only externalized cost, but it is it is.
*  Unrecognized, unrecognized
*  savings that we offer
*  that can't be captured in a square peg and around whole.
*  I see what you're saying.
*  Yeah. The the overall big picture of health for you, health for the food.
*  How much is that worth? Yeah. Right.
*  That's interesting that we're not really taking any consideration
*  these secondary costs that come about from doing it the wrong way.
*  Yeah, we're not. We're not.
*  I mean, there's there's a lot of those.
*  You you can much much of our increased cost
*  has nothing to do with actual production cost.
*  It's it's the non scalable regulatory overheads.
*  And this and this, of course, is why we don't have more community
*  small scale abattoirs around the country.
*  It's not because they're not a demand for them.
*  It's because the the the paperwork, the
*  HACCP plans, hazardous analysis, critical control point plans
*  and the paperwork to be able to launch a business like this
*  require the are so high that the both time and money are so high
*  that it's very difficult to launch a small business,
*  you know, because you can't spread the overhead
*  of capitalization over.
*  Is there a solution to that? Is it?
*  Well, there are a couple of solutions.
*  Certainly one one that's that's being championed right now
*  by Congressman Thomas Massey called the Prime Act.
*  He's had it in for five years.
*  And amazingly, it's kind of just floundered for five years.
*  All of a sudden in the last two months, he's got 18 new co-sponsors
*  because of this and what the Prime Act would do.
*  It would allow it would allow uninspected custom processed meat
*  in state to be sold by the piece.
*  That's not legal right now.
*  Right now, the only way that you can sell a T-bone,
*  if you want to buy a T-bone steak, the only way for you to get it
*  is for me to go to a federal inspecting slaughterhouse,
*  get the animal processed, packaged under inspection and put in for you.
*  Custom houses are where if you want to buy a half a beef,
*  a quarter beef, all right, and it goes in with your name on that quarter
*  and they're custom processing it for me.
*  Yeah. Then, you know, then I can buy it.
*  And what what Congressman Massey is saying with the Prime Act is
*  why should we discriminate and only allow people to tap into the lower cost
*  and lower, lower overheads of the custom processing facility
*  to only those people who can afford to buy a quarter of beef at a time?
*  That's that's very poverty discriminatory.
*  Let's open that up so that people can buy it by the piece.
*  We're not going to ship it interstate.
*  We're not going to sell it at Wal-Mart. OK, there's.
*  But if you and I as neighbors
*  want to do business together, as and I'm using a powerful phrasing
*  here as consenting adults, if we want to exercise freedom of joy, of choice
*  and participate in a consensual relationship of commerce,
*  why should that be a bureaucrats
*  business between, you know, between two consenting neighbors?
*  Right. So what you're saying is is long.
*  But is the the regulatory process in place to make sure that people are using
*  the proper sanitation methods, making sure that the animals are healthy,
*  making sure that all these things are in place so that unscrupulous characters
*  don't take advantage of the system and then screw over the consumer
*  and the consumer gets sick.
*  Like this is like best case scenario for the regulation, right?
*  That it's there to protect us.
*  Well, that's that's the that's the assumption. Yes.
*  And I would simply ask
*  that at some point when you have a very close,
*  transparent relationship, one on one, you don't you don't have,
*  you know, truckers and warehouses and big slaughterhouses and, you know,
*  supermarkets, blah, blah, blah in between us.
*  There is there is
*  a lot of protection in that relational transaction
*  that beats all the paperwork you can amass on the industrial scale.
*  We we recognize scale in a lot of things in life, for example, in Virginia,
*  where I'm from, if you want to open a if you want to do daycare,
*  let's say you want to do a work at home deal, you know,
*  you want to do a side gig and keep children.
*  You can keep up to three in your home without subjecting yourself
*  to the licensing and compliance of daycare regulations,
*  because they know if all you're going to do is keep three in your homes,
*  those parents, you're going to have a close relationship with them.
*  It's this is not a this is not a daycare center. All right.
*  All right. The same thing is true with elder care.
*  My wife's grandmother spent her last year in a lady's home
*  who is allowed to keep three people as elder care.
*  She was an RN.
*  She wanted to not have to go to the hospital every day
*  and started a side gig in her home. She cooked for them.
*  She took care of them. Three of them in her home.
*  Does this vary state by state?
*  It does vary state by state.
*  I'm just giving you an example of where
*  of where reason where
*  where it's reasonable to appreciate
*  that a different relationship at scale. Yes.
*  Can create its own safety.
*  In that particular thing,
*  can you keep a hundred in your home without a license? No.
*  But three, if you're only going to keep three,
*  you're probably going to see them.
*  You're probably going to have a direct relationship
*  with each of their of their caregivers, their, you know, their
*  people that are signing off for them.
*  It's a different relationship.
*  And so all I would say is that from the safety issue
*  that there needs to be some place, a point at which
*  we can opt to do business with each other without a bureaucrat involved.
*  May I ask you this? If you wanted to slaughter a cow
*  and then you wanted to give some of the meat away to your neighbor,
*  would you have to bring it to some sort of a facility?
*  Perfectly legal, perfectly legal.
*  So this is not a yeah, if it were if this were all about safety. Right.
*  You wouldn't be able to do that.
*  So so the important thing to realize is that the the prohibition here
*  is not on the in fact, our neighbor can even buy it legally.
*  Oh, really? I can't I just can't sell it.
*  So the prohibition is only on one.
*  If you can't sell it, how are they going to buy it?
*  Black market.
*  So so so if if if I if if I if I did this under the radar, OK,
*  so I butcher a chicken in my backyard and the neighbor comes over
*  and buys it from me. OK, it's legal for him.
*  It's legal for him to buy it.
*  It's not legal for me to sell it.
*  But every but everything else in society that we've determined
*  is a hazardous controlled substance, a hazardous substance.
*  The prohibition is both on seller and buyer. Right.
*  And I don't want to go down that rabbit hole either.
*  I'm a I'm a pretty libertarian drug.
*  Let it all go. But but but without regard to that,
*  the prohibitions are equal on even possession.
*  If you want to if you want to have a ton of cocaine in your house.
*  You even if you just went over there in a corner on a pallet.
*  Yeah, I've got a ton of cocaine here.
*  What's wrong with that? You can't have that. All right. Right.
*  But when it comes to food products,
*  the prohibitions are only on one side
*  and they don't include if you give it away.
*  So if it was really dangerous, you shouldn't be able to buy it.
*  You shouldn't be able to possess it and you shouldn't be able to give it away.
*  I see what you're saying, kind of.
*  But the difference is, first of all, cocaine is illegal.
*  Beef's not illegal.
*  And second of all, it's like you're trying to the idea is
*  you're trying to protect the consumer. Right.
*  And I think that they have exceptions for these small situations
*  where you're the farmer and this maybe this guy is growing tomatoes
*  and you trade him some filet mignon for some tomatoes.
*  And you have a good deal there.
*  That makes sense that they you know, I think it's more reasonable
*  they step back and let that happen.
*  But it is odd that they can buy unregulated beef,
*  but you can't sell unregulated beef.
*  So it's like, well, how did you get that beef? I bought it.
*  Is it regulated? No. All right.
*  They don't even go, who's who's the criminal selling you the beef?
*  Yeah, it's very strange. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Yeah. So the farmer's the one that's liable.
*  The the buyer is the customer is not.
*  But the same thing is true.
*  I mean, the important let's let's appreciate to, for example, wildlife.
*  I mean, right now you can go out and during hunting season
*  and you can shoot a deer.
*  And you don't have to worry about temperature.
*  You don't have you don't have to worry about any inspections.
*  Nothing. Or a wild pig. Right.
*  Squirrel. You can bring that home.
*  And there's there's no inspection, no nothing over that.
*  And you can dress that yourself.
*  I mean, you know, butcher it, package it, whatever.
*  Feed it to your children.
*  You can have a block party, invite all your block and have a and
*  and feed everybody with that food. That's perfectly legal.
*  But to do a chicken or a pig or a cow
*  and on your own and and sell that
*  what is what is it about about selling something that suddenly turns it from
*  benign to hazardous?
*  Well, I think it's just protection for the consumer.
*  And I think it's also like it'd be fine if it was a small neighborhood
*  where you knew the farmer and you had a great relationship with them.
*  But they're talking about doing things at scale.
*  And when you're talking about selling food to, you know, a large city,
*  it's you can't really just hope the guy did a good job.
*  That's the argument for regulation.
*  The argument for regulation is when things scale up,
*  where you need someone to step in and protect the consumers,
*  because if there is one bad actor who's not taking care of it,
*  he has the potential of sickening thousands of people. Right.
*  Which is which is the argument, exactly the argument for decentralizing
*  and de-amalgamating as opposed to centralizing and amalgamating.
*  Is it a land issue, though?
*  Like if you wanted it, like the factory farms that I've seen in videos,
*  where they have these pigs, they're stuffed next to each other
*  in this large warehouse and the same with the chickens. Right.
*  How much space would you need to have the same amount of chickens
*  and the same amount of pigs if you let them free range? All right.
*  Here's my point.
*  What you don't see in those videos is you don't see
*  the hundreds of acres growing corn and soybeans
*  to feed them in that house.
*  The industry wants you to think that this is some sort of a,
*  you know, an island, you know, where we're boy,
*  we're looking we're cranking this out of this house.
*  They're not showing you the tractor trailers bringing in the grain,
*  bringing in the and hauling out the manure and the square miles of fields
*  to spread the manure. OK.
*  They're not showing you how dependent that is on this massive land base.
*  And so so on in the pastured model, the decentralized pastured model,
*  instead of having 15000.
*  I mean, our farm, we're going to raise like 45000 chickens this summer.
*  We're not we're not backyard by any means.
*  But guess what? Those are in two hundred
*  seventy five bird shelters
*  that are moved every day across pastures.
*  It doesn't take one more acre
*  to produce the feed or handle the manure, whether the chicken is outside or inside.
*  The difference is when you come and see our operation, you see all the land.
*  When you see the factory farm, you don't see any of the land.
*  But isn't it possible that these factory farms are set up where the farms
*  where the animals are raised are completely separate?
*  It's a separate business from the farms where the soybeans and the corn are.
*  Oh, yeah. Well, ours is not on the same property.
*  No, it's ours is to we buy.
*  We buy our grain from neighbors. Absolutely.
*  But if they had to grow these animals and grow that food,
*  would they have enough land to do everything together in the same farm?
*  But there's no need to do it on the same farm.
*  I'm a big believer in mutual, mutual interdependence, not complete independence.
*  We don't have any intention to grow our own grain.
*  We we don't have the soils for it. We don't have the equipment for it.
*  We don't have the skill set for it.
*  So we buy from neighbors who do GMO free, non genetically modified, GMO free grain.
*  And and we give them more than they would on a commodity on a commodity scale.
*  And so they love us because we're giving them more per bushel
*  and they have a nice, secure buyer and they're local.
*  They're close.
*  You know, we're not getting it from, you know, foreign countries.
*  And it's all close.
*  So what happens is in in the kind of situation I'm describing,
*  instead of having a fundamentally segregated food system,
*  you have a fundamentally integrated food system.
*  I see what you're saying. That's what happens.
*  Strong relationship with people growing.
*  So, for example, I mean, you started the discussion with can Los Angeles,
*  you know, is there enough land to feed Los Angeles?
*  You know, the the and we and we could discuss whether there's
*  where the Los Angeles should be as big as it is.
*  I mean, that's a valid discussion.
*  It's a very valid discussion.
*  But but but we can go there.
*  But first, let me just say that if California, for example,
*  did not export.
*  I don't know what the percentage is, but it's huge.
*  You know, almonds all over the world.
*  If California is centered on feeding California,
*  there's absolutely enough here to feed California.
*  OK, I mean, Iowa, Iowa imports 90 percent.
*  Iowa is probably the most fertile place in the world.
*  And they only eat only only 10 percent of the food
*  consumed in Iowa is grown in Iowa and processed in Iowa.
*  That's pretty crazy. It is crazy.
*  Hawaii, only five percent, ninety five percent comes from off Hawaii.
*  I mean, they've got ranches.
*  They've got I mean, why would you have to import stuff if you can grow pineapples,
*  pineapples and, you know, macadamia nuts in your backyard?
*  Come on, you know.
*  So there's a there's a huge there's a huge disconnect.
*  I mean, the the the the the the and this is one of the reasons
*  that we're having this, I think this this blowback from nature
*  is that instead of having a fundamentally integrated system,
*  I mean, think of how in Switzerland, you know,
*  they take the cows up to the mountain pastures, they milk
*  and the milk flows down and they make cheese up there.
*  The whey from the cheese goes into the into the pigs.
*  The pigs eat the whey.
*  And so instead of transporting milk to a centralized cheese maker
*  and pigs to a centralized processor,
*  they're actually making the cheese on site.
*  So all they've got to actually transport is cheese.
*  And and pork.
*  So they slaughter, they slaughter, you know, contiguous nearby,
*  not on the same farm necessarily, but but nearby.
*  So you don't have all this transportation.
*  What you have is a fundamentally decentralized,
*  we could even say democratized.
*  Can we say food distance, food, food, food distancing
*  that that creates resiliency in the system.
*  So instead of being tied to these hundred or hundred
*  and fifty mega processing facilities.
*  We're decentralized throughout the land base.
*  How much more money do you think it would cost for food?
*  We kind of touched on this earlier,
*  but if you're dealing with this more natural based system
*  and it's more complex, it's going to require more people
*  and it's going to require complete restructuring of the system
*  that's currently in place. Sure it would.
*  I think I don't have a figure for I mean, I'm not a scientist,
*  but I think I think in general it would be probably double
*  what you'd pay at Costco. Double.
*  Yeah, that's an issue for a lot of folks.
*  Well, but now think about this. Think about this.
*  You. Oh, man, where do you start with this?
*  First of all, you're going to you're going to offer a lot of jobs.
*  There are a lot of people that are going to be looking for jobs right now.
*  So so this offers a lot of job opportunities.
*  Number two, it's much more healing on the land.
*  Number three, you don't have all the pathogenicity, you know,
*  you don't have to use drugs, antibiotics.
*  I mean, our meat doesn't do drugs.
*  OK, our dinner doesn't do drugs.
*  People don't realize that, you know, two thirds of the drugs used
*  in the country aren't in people, they're in animals. OK.
*  So you don't have those issues.
*  There are a lot of issues that you that you don't have.
*  And those those add up in the big picture.
*  So I always tell people our food is the cheapest aggregate
*  food there is. We just put all the costs in.
*  All our all our costs are in. OK.
*  And and so we're not we're not asking taxpayers, society, the planet.
*  We're not asking them to pick up the tab for, you know, for cheating,
*  for for cutting for cutting corners.
*  And that's what Costco is.
*  And what's interesting is that that 40 years ago,
*  right now today, nine percent of the average
*  person's income, nine percent is spent on food.
*  That's our average in our country.
*  Forty years ago, it was 18.
*  Hmm. Forty years ago, nine percent of our personal income was spent on health care.
*  Today, that's 18 percent.
*  Oh, isn't that interesting how those have inverted?
*  Yeah, very. Those have inverted in rough in roughly 40 years.
*  Ever since the US, the call to us, the created the food pyramid
*  and put Twinkies and Cocoa Puffs on the bottom as a foundational.
*  And you can track the diabetes.
*  You can track obesity.
*  You can track all of these things right through from that time.
*  It's that's an interesting way to look at costs, right?
*  Like we're only looking at the cost of the meat.
*  We're not looking at the cost for your health, the cost of health care.
*  Now, when you see steak at Costco, it's insanely cheap.
*  It almost doesn't. It's almost obscene.
*  It's like, how is a steak that cheap?
*  Like, what are you doing? Like, how is it possible?
*  You know, yeah, well, it's
*  you know, there are all sorts of special, you know, whatever fraternal
*  negotiated things to make that happen.
*  And and the fact is that you don't have to watch the news very much
*  to know that farm suicide is spiking.
*  You know, there's there are implications.
*  I mean, the whole
*  the domino effect of dysfunction,
*  there's a reason why rural America has a bigger opioid problem
*  than than urban America.
*  You know, the pandemic has been primarily an urban situation,
*  but the opioid crisis has been primarily a rural situation.
*  Why? Because folks feel
*  disaffirmed. I mean, one of the biggest,
*  you know, one of the biggest things that this virus has brought out,
*  you know, they say that the crisis never makes it never makes a trend.
*  It simply accelerates or brings in the focus, a trend that was already there.
*  And one of the trends has been happening in this country now for 20 years
*  is a bifurcation of access between rural and urban
*  to the Internet.
*  Like on our farm, you know,
*  we we still, you know, we still have hours of the day
*  where we can't get cell phone service, we can't get Internet service.
*  Somebody comes to the store and we can't run their credit card
*  because the Wi-Fi is down.
*  It's very, very slow, very problem.
*  We can't do Skype.
*  We you know, we barely can do it when I do Zoom calls.
*  It kicks me off about three times every hour.
*  Right now, that sounds like a magic place that you live.
*  Yeah, that's the thing that people are having a hard time with is digital
*  detoxing. Right. I understand that much of it in their lives.
*  I get that. I get that.
*  But when you're running a business, right, or you're trying to do schoolwork
*  from home. Yeah.
*  So what's happening is we are now
*  we're now getting a very,
*  a very accelerated urban rural
*  divide of opportunity
*  because because rural we don't we don't have this this access.
*  And, you know, I'm not asking for a big government programs,
*  but I am telling, you know, I'm telling you that that this this
*  this access to broadband Internet,
*  especially now as we start working from home and as we have people there.
*  There are lots of people I'm sure you probably know some.
*  They're saying I'm getting out of the city and I ain't going back.
*  I mean, right now, New York City, all the movie companies in New York,
*  their warehouses are stuck full of people who called them and said,
*  I fled the city with from the coronavirus.
*  I want you to clean out my apartment, put it in a warehouse,
*  and I'll tell you where to send it when I get myself situated.
*  I mean, that's a phenomenon that's already happening.
*  Well, where are those people going to go?
*  I mean, ideally, they would we would actually spread out
*  and create a more, you know, a spread out population on the on the landscape.
*  Well, people realize in the hazards of living on top of each other like that,
*  not just because of virus and the things spread like wildfire
*  through the population, but also when you have to get out,
*  if something goes down and you got to get out of there and you realize,
*  like, I don't even have a car.
*  Like, I can't what am I going to do?
*  Carry my bed on my back?
*  Like, what are you going to do?
*  Yeah. And people realize like, hey, maybe this isn't the best idea to live like this.
*  And then when they look at the prospects of New York City going back to normal,
*  like what it was five months ago, boy, that's a long road.
*  You might be two years from now before it's like that again. Right.
*  That's right. It might not happen at all.
*  This is the other thing.
*  I was watching this this documentary on the construction of viruses, this piece.
*  And they were talking about like this when they give an 18 month
*  window for creating a vaccine for this virus, they're like, but maybe not.
*  Right. Yeah. They're like, maybe it does.
*  Maybe they don't come up with one that's effective.
*  That's possible, too.
*  We've been 40 years with the flu.
*  Still don't have a flu vaccine.
*  What is the flu shot?
*  The flu shot? Well, that's that's supposedly to help the flu.
*  But there's how many strains of it and they never hit the right strain.
*  I mean, the actual the actual efficacy of the flu shot
*  has not been determined.
*  It is a vaccine, though.
*  It is. It is.
*  I had Dr. Peter Hotez on, who is an expert in vaccines and infectious
*  diseases and tropical diseases.
*  And one of the things that he was saying that if you get the flu shot,
*  even if it's not for the correct strain, there's still enough pieces of this
*  that will protect you from getting really bad sickness from the flu strain,
*  even if it's the wrong strain.
*  That's one opinion.
*  You don't agree with that.
*  I don't agree with that opinion.
*  I think you're out there drinking with cows.
*  Absolutely. Yeah, I do.
*  I mean, when this when this all broke, we sent a we sent a letter out
*  to our customers saying, hey, come to the farm.
*  Take off your shoes. Walk barefoot through the pasture.
*  We've got a nice big compost pile.
*  Stick your hands in the compost pile.
*  You know, feed your microbiome.
*  Did anybody take you up on that offer?
*  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
*  You had a bunch of freaks out there.
*  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. That's great.
*  Taking their hand and.
*  Yeah, it's yeah, it's great. It's great.
*  And and so did you check on them, see if they're OK a couple of weeks later?
*  I don't think anybody's gotten sick from it.
*  It's a check. But yeah.
*  But I think I think that that in general,
*  we need to be asking as a nation.
*  I mean, I'm still waiting for when they do the daily
*  briefs up there in the White House, I'm still waiting for somebody up there,
*  anybody, somebody to step to the microphone and say, look, folks,
*  let's talk about immunity.
*  Let's talk about how you build immunity.
*  And the fact that we're in the middle of this and we've still got the coke trucks
*  running up and down the road and and and look, I like a coke,
*  you know, once a year, twice a year.
*  But but there's a big difference between doing that and three times a day.
*  Where what are we eating?
*  Are we eating, you know, comfort food, taco chips?
*  And look, I like chocolate, but enough is enough, you know.
*  And and are we in our kitchens?
*  Are we are we actually getting good food?
*  Or are we are we hydrating?
*  All of us are most of us are dehydrated because the water tastes bad.
*  Well, let's let's make sure we each drink half a gallon a day.
*  Let's let's start there. How about sleep?
*  Are you getting, you know, eight and a half hours a night?
*  Or are you staying up watching Netflix because you're depressed,
*  eating, you know, chips and drinking soda because you're depressed
*  and you get six hours of sleep?
*  All that builds up. Hey, how about how about have you forgiven everybody?
*  You know, resentment, resentment eats you.
*  I mean, it eats you up.
*  Resentment, you know, vengeance, resentment.
*  And and and some guilt.
*  Yes, guilt and whatever you stole, give it back.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  And if you've got a if you've got a bad situation with somebody,
*  call them up, apologize. You fucked up.
*  Yeah. Be the first. Be the first. Yeah, exactly.
*  Let it go. Let it go. Let it go.
*  And I just think I just think that those simple like, you know, six or seven
*  immune, get exercise, go get outside, run around in the sun. All right.
*  Those kinds of things.
*  If we I mean, you know, Michelle Obama had the Let's Move campaign.
*  It was a great campaign.
*  She was she was right on. OK.
*  And I'm not trying to be political.
*  I'm just she was she was right.
*  And now I mean,
*  my my driver that picked me up from the airport last night, you know,
*  he said, he said,
*  you know, this is my first he said, this is my first job for a month.
*  And he said, all I've been doing is inside the house watching Netflix.
*  Well, that's not going to build your immune system.
*  He needs to get out and.
*  Go stick his hand in poo.
*  Don't you think that I mean, I mean, I don't know if this is true,
*  but I would imagine that the immune system is like your cardiovascular system.
*  It needs to work out. It does.
*  And many people believe this.
*  In fact, there's an entire school of thought.
*  The you know, this hyperallergenic thing
*  where a lot of the allergies we have today are because we're so sterile.
*  I mean, this was part of the part of the kind of unspoken part of
*  the book Guns, Germs and Steel.
*  You know, that was a fascinating book.
*  And it talked about the ascendancy of the Europeans
*  who kept livestock in their house.
*  And that's why they were immune to smallpox and all these things
*  that were devastating to the other people that didn't have nearby livestock.
*  And so we want our customers to come out and pet a calf,
*  go in the brooder and pick up a chick and hold a chicken.
*  And we think that that's really, really
*  that's not just that's not just whatever nostalgic.
*  I would be interested to see what's going to I'm sorry.
*  But what's going to happen when people do go back to normal life
*  with these compromised immune systems from being inside all the time,
*  whether or not just regular common cold kicks in on a larger scale?
*  Well, there are medical doctors.
*  I can't give you names right now, but I'm like you.
*  I'm sleuthing all this different material.
*  And I can tell you there are are numerous medical doctors who are saying
*  that as we come out of this, we're going to see a spate of exactly colds
*  flu, different things, because we haven't been exercising our immune systems.
*  Yeah. In this soup.
*  And in fact, Governor Cuomo was
*  it was interesting his reaction the other day when he got the report, the data now
*  there's more data is coming out every day.
*  And one of the reports that just came out last week was that in New York,
*  the people who continued working actually had less
*  less whatever positives to the virus
*  than the people who sheltered
*  across the demographic, including front line hospital workers,
*  which you look at that and you say, well,
*  you know, the people who were sheltering.
*  They were dwelling on I mean, they were watching news all day.
*  If you watch the media all day, you are
*  you are scared to death.
*  OK. And rightly so.
*  That's what you're feeding your mind.
*  But if you're if you're working and you're building and you're creating
*  and you're doing your doing your things.
*  Sure, you might think about the virus once in a while.
*  But I mean, literally in my day,
*  I don't think about it, but a few minutes a day.
*  It's only when I come in and turn on the news or look at podcasts
*  that I'm I'm besieged with.
*  I'm interested in it.
*  But but I'm out there busy.
*  And and there's something that happens, I think, psychosomatically, when you just
*  consume and your mind is consumed every day with.
*  With fear. Yeah, for sure.
*  Well, it's the media's played into it.
*  And and also people over here and they're hearing terrible stories
*  about emergency rooms, particularly in New York City and places
*  where it's stuff full of people and the hospitals are overrun,
*  the ICUs are overrun.
*  Thank goodness that that is sort of calmed down even in New York City.
*  Right. Cuomo basically said today that they're back to where they were
*  when the pandemic exploded.
*  So it's nice that they've sort of leveled that out.
*  But what's going to happen when you just let people out again?
*  Are they going to start getting sick like crazy again?
*  I mean, is it going to be another spread?
*  There's a real worry about that.
*  And we're worried that during this time, we haven't been encouraging people
*  to build up their immune system.
*  We have been encouraging them to exercise.
*  We've just been feeding them fear.
*  Yes, that's right.
*  That's it's been it's been a feeling of fear.
*  And so, you know, interestingly, I've just I've got a book
*  that's actually we'll have in hand
*  May in whatever, 10 days, a new book coming out
*  written with a with a nutritionist biochemist, Dr.
*  Sina McCullough, and the title of the book is Beyond Labels.
*  And it's it's a it's a doctor and a farmer.
*  Leads you to a place of food empowerment.
*  You know, when you stand in front of a bunch of labels
*  and you see everything from organic certified to fair trade to
*  you know, natural.
*  They're very confusing.
*  They're very and what happens is when you have when you're faced with.
*  So much choice of of label information,
*  you tend to just shut down, you get paralyzed, you say,
*  forget it, you know, it's too complicated, it's too it's too difficult.
*  And so so we've written this book,
*  she from this chemistry standpoint, me from a farmer standpoint,
*  trying to cut through this.
*  And so people
*  can be empowered to actually
*  to actually make food decisions that will.
*  And we talk a lot about immunity, feeding your microbiome
*  to build that up so that you have a diversified enough,
*  exercised enough immune system
*  that you can withstand this.
*  And and so I think that I think that developing
*  a robust immune system.
*  Think about if that occupied your mind,
*  how am I going to develop a robust immune system?
*  Just think about dwelling on that as opposed to,
*  oh, no, am I going to get it? Am I going to get it? Right.
*  I don't think we've scratched the surface as to what thinking
*  I'm going to build my immune system.
*  Let's let's be let's let's go get them.
*  OK, let's let's just just
*  just just the mind body connection,
*  what that does to your body to suddenly get a burst of hope
*  as opposed to a constant diet of despair.
*  It has to have a big factor.
*  It just I mean, that kind of stress plays a big factor
*  with people's immune systems all the time.
*  If people are stressed out, they always get sick.
*  It's real, real common.
*  It just makes sense.
*  And I think this kind of fear, particularly,
*  I mean, the way I was experiencing it when the when the lockdown
*  was first ordered and everyone was at the supermarket,
*  no one was wearing masks yet, but everyone was stockpiling food.
*  And, you know, we were nervous.
*  We were real nervous because we didn't know what this was going to be like.
*  And we were also I was nervous, particularly because I feel like
*  the information we were getting out of China was not correct.
*  And I was worried that when you see those videos of them
*  spraying disinfectant on houses and buildings,
*  it's like maybe this is way worse than we think it is.
*  And it's going to hit America really hard because we've been lied to by the Chinese.
*  There was a lot of fear.
*  So I remember lying in bed at night and like testing my breath.
*  Maybe I have it now.
*  Maybe it's going to get worse.
*  You know, there's a lot of that.
*  There's a lot of that.
*  I didn't sleep real good at all for maybe the first few days of lockdown
*  till I sort of calmed down and realized, well, I'm not going anywhere.
*  I can't get it.
*  You know, and then I got tested.
*  I'm like, OK, well, this is nice to know that I don't have it currently.
*  Like maybe if I just keep doing what I'm doing, I won't get it.
*  But then, you know, I'd have days where half the day I think this is all bullshit.
*  What we need to do is tell people how to strengthen their immune system.
*  And then you read some crazy story about some new inflammatory syndrome
*  they're finding on, you know, some patients where, you know,
*  their feet are swelling up.
*  Yeah. Blue toes and all this. Yeah.
*  And then you get scared again. Yeah.
*  I'm totally with you.
*  And I think that that brings up the issue of how our society now views death.
*  I read an interesting article just in the last couple of days
*  about how how as we have left.
*  It used to be when we were kids.
*  We used the term somebody dropped dead.
*  Remember that? You know, they just dropped dead days.
*  All right. Well, today we don't say they dropped dead.
*  We say apparently medicine failed them or the hospital.
*  I mean, it's like it's like instead of just people.
*  Yeah, we do drop dead.
*  Instead, every death is some sort of a failure of our
*  techno sophisticated cryogenic, you know,
*  system that's supposed to keep everybody.
*  You know, beautiful and perfect, forever, perfect, forever.
*  And the fact the fact is, you know, and I think that's an advantage
*  of on the farm where we are.
*  I mean, we we see death every day.
*  I mean, we we know that things and and in fact,
*  in fact, death makes room.
*  I mean, a compost pile is is death and life.
*  I mean, it's it's you've got microbes eating stuff that was living.
*  And then and then that makes new life.
*  And of course, my family knows that that when I go,
*  they're supposed to put me in a compost pile.
*  You know, really? Yeah. Yeah.
*  Put me in a compost pile. I mean, that's that legal, though.
*  Don't they have to cremate you or something?
*  I think I think that at least put me in the ground or something.
*  But that's my joke.
*  Yeah, I don't even think they're allowed to just put you in the ground.
*  I think they have to pump you up with chemicals.
*  Oh, no, no, no, no. My dad, my dad.
*  Nothing, nothing.
*  No. In the ground.
*  That was it. And did you have to sign paperwork saying
*  that you didn't kill your dad or anything?
*  Because, you know, what?
*  No, no.
*  What we did have to get was a special use permit for a family graveyard.
*  So we've got we've got 10.
*  We've got permission for 10 spots.
*  So we're good for a couple of generations.
*  You don't have to use formaldehyde. No, no.
*  But nothing.
*  Everywhere else you do, though, correct?
*  You either cremate or use formaldehyde.
*  And I think these formaldehyde before they cremate.
*  Well, there's there are now burgeoning around the country.
*  There are natural cemeteries. Really? Yeah.
*  And there are especially primitive cemeteries where there's nothing.
*  Nothing is is used. But
*  we're probably times they can't exhume anybody, right?
*  You assume your bones, I guess.
*  The bones would stay for a good while.
*  We know the bones last a long time.
*  But, you know, my my thing is that, look, I don't want
*  I don't want a bunch of people to die.
*  But but the fact is that
*  that death is is transformative.
*  And I don't want to get all too mystical and spiritual.
*  But whatever your your spiritual tradition is,
*  I mean, mine happens to be Judeo Christian ethics.
*  So I think there is an afterlife.
*  But but but even even if even if there's nothing,
*  even if you say, well, I'm dead and there's no spirit and I'm gone.
*  Even so, that makes room.
*  For tomorrow's babies, it makes room for new ideas, new things.
*  I mean, you can't.
*  You can't have you can't have life without the regenerative
*  regenerative capacity of death.
*  And and and the the foundation of ecology
*  is life, death, decomposition, regeneration, life, death.
*  Not regeneration might be looked like something else.
*  OK, but but that's that's that's our digestion.
*  It's compost. It's you know, it's everything.
*  And when and when we get sterilized,
*  uh, and and and.
*  Move away from that.
*  I think we lose the beauty of the transformative capacity.
*  Of that part of life.
*  Yeah, I think it speaks to what you were talking about earlier,
*  that they look at death as some sort of a failure
*  instead of just a part of the natural cycle.
*  I was reading about one of the, you know, they try to find new ways
*  that the coronavirus looks terrible in articles.
*  And one thing they were saying was it takes between two and ten years
*  off the life of life expectancy of the average person who gets it.
*  I'm like, OK, well, how did you come to that conclusion?
*  Well, I think they came to that conclusion because they looked at old people
*  who got it that might have possibly lived, you know, seven, eight years,
*  five years more, and they just started doing these random calculations
*  based on how old people normally die.
*  But then the problem with that is if you look at the overall numbers,
*  the average age that people die from coronavirus is actually older
*  than the average age people die, which is like, well, what are you saying?
*  That like it's taking years off some people's lives, but everything does.
*  If you fall down, it takes years off your life.
*  If you're old, right, you die from falling that fall.
*  Should we stop all falling if you get sick?
*  If you eat too much sugar? Yes.
*  Well, that's a big one, right?
*  And that's one that's killing people at almost the same numbers
*  as the coronavirus was at the peak.
*  I remember there was like a graph that coronavirus has passed heart attacks.
*  But wait a minute, how many goddamn heart attacks are there?
*  Is there something we could do about heart attacks?
*  Forget about that now. This is a pandemic.
*  Yeah, I mean, cigarettes, no one even touched with a 10 foot pole
*  because cigarettes is killing people at four and five times the rate coronavirus
*  was, and no one was saying anything of it because it's an elective thing.
*  You're allowed to do it. It's a freedom. People enjoy it.
*  You're grown adults here.
*  But stay home, stay home and wear a mask and don't touch anything and stay home.
*  And you're going to lose your job.
*  But stay home because you're not really a grown adult.
*  You're a grown adult. I'll let you smoke cigarettes at home.
*  How about that? You feel better?
*  And now? Yeah, well, I think I think a couple of things.
*  One is that, you know, our country has never told people
*  when we talk about, you know, personal self-worth and your own personal
*  affirmation in a climate of fear and worry.
*  The worst thing you can do is tell lots of people,
*  you're not important, you're not essential.
*  Yeah, you know what you've been doing all your life, what you do every day.
*  That it's it's not as what a faster way
*  to whatever deaffirm, you know, a person than to tell them,
*  you're not essential. I mean, I just think it's horrible.
*  And now we have the data.
*  And again, these data points, we've all become,
*  I think through this more wary of statisticians.
*  Yeah. But but one that I just saw again this week was that every
*  every percent increase in unemployment
*  equals 30,000 deaths in our country annually.
*  Every one percent unemployment, suicide, depression, whatever.
*  That's a really important statistic. Yeah, it is.
*  So so so we've gone now from, you know, that that white, hot
*  three and a half percent unemployment to now what?
*  Eighteen and a half. That's fifteen. Fifteen percent.
*  I'm frankly I'm frankly actually amazed that we're at only 18 percent right now.
*  But I think that's only because a lot of people have been furloughed
*  and are not unemployed.
*  So so, you know, if all those people go back to work
*  that have been furloughed, restaurants and things like that, it'll be OK.
*  But anyway, we've we've increased in the last 60 days,
*  15 percent in unemployment.
*  If that 30,000 figure is actually correct.
*  That's an additional 450,000 people a year.
*  You know, dying from from external
*  ramifications of being unwanted.
*  And this is in line with what you said earlier about costs.
*  Right. Right. Like we were you're talking about the cost of food.
*  But and then look at the cost of health care.
*  And when the cost of food is higher and food is higher quality,
*  look at that the cost of health where it drops in an equal number.
*  Right. And I think this is this is along those lines.
*  We're looking at death through the coronavirus.
*  But we're saying, oh, you're putting dollars over lives.
*  You're saying the economy is more important than people's lives.
*  No, we're saying you need a nuanced perspective,
*  because if you ignore the economy, it actually costs lives
*  and it costs a staggering number of lives and in a horrible way.
*  Suicide, drug addiction, depression.
*  Right. And if I if I may go a little just one other little
*  thread on this whole thing,
*  again, thinking about, well, where are who?
*  How can we employ all the people?
*  I mean, if if our if our discretionary spending,
*  if this is going to make people more careful about discretionary spending,
*  you know, flying to Paris, going on a Caribbean cruise,
*  going to the Sandals, you know, cheap those Caribbean cruises are.
*  Jamie and I have been going over this.
*  It's basically cheaper than being homeless.
*  You could be on a cruise for like five to seven nights
*  for one hundred and five bucks with all you can eat.
*  Wow. Where are you going to get that kind of food?
*  That's right. You're not going to.
*  So if I was a homeless person, I would just get me a constant string
*  of cruise ship rides.
*  You got to figure a hundred.
*  That's five thousand bucks a year. Yeah. Right.
*  A little bit more than five thousand bucks a year.
*  You live like a king. Wow. Wow.
*  A little spot. See, they want you to pay for booze, I think.
*  Oh, pretty sure that's what it is.
*  That's where they make their money.
*  Yeah. So I get the money.
*  Ridiculous cheap board.
*  Kind of like gas stations make their money on on jerky and,
*  you know, and soft drinks.
*  Sure. Yeah. They don't make their money on gas.
*  But anyway, so one of the things that we're key on
*  because our fertility program is carbon.
*  That's what feeds the soil. Carbon, right?
*  Not 10, 10, 10 chemical fertilizer carbon.
*  And so you use fertilizers at all? No, no, we don't.
*  That's amazing. We don't.
*  So just manure and natural fertilizers.
*  But we have a big industrial chipper.
*  You'd love this machine.
*  I mean, it's the ultimate, you know, boy toy.
*  You know, it's it's a hundred and twenty horsepower diesel engine
*  that can that can chip 19 inch.
*  You can take a 40 foot tree and just hook it in there.
*  And it just, you know, just chips.
*  I've seen those online. All right.
*  Well, I mean, they're like the cool.
*  That scares the shit out of me. All right.
*  So but that's the Fargo.
*  That's our fertilizer factory.
*  OK, so carbon.
*  So we integrate forest with open land
*  and and we integrate the carbon
*  from the forest.
*  So we cut junk trees, dead trees, crooked trees, weak trees.
*  And thin the forest.
*  And that enables the good trees, the healthy trees,
*  to grow more vigorously, better, reduces fire potential
*  because you're thinning it out, taking out all the dead stuff.
*  And that then becomes our carbon base for bedding the animals,
*  for, you know, and for all the composting that we do.
*  And we do, you know, mountains and mountains of compost.
*  Where I'm going with this is when we talk about costs,
*  right now, how much is our country spending fighting wildfires
*  and how much are we losing fighting all these?
*  And we're in California, right?
*  I mean, look at the devastation that fires have caused.
*  Imagine, imagine if those if we had thousands of people
*  with chippers thinning the forest,
*  turning them into almost park like,
*  like they were before the Europeans came.
*  The Native Americans kept them going with, you know, with fire.
*  But there were there was mega fauna here, mega fauna.
*  And so we graze through, we convert a lot of it into,
*  you know, silvo pasture, widely spaced trees
*  that are growing unimpeded with grazing animals underneath
*  so that there's no fire damage, there's no buildup of fuel.
*  And suddenly we're producing our own food
*  and we're eliminating the danger of wildfire
*  with technology called chainsaws and chippers.
*  And that carbon becomes the fertility for the vineyards
*  and the agricultural lands.
*  It feeds the soil.
*  So now we have earthworms instead of hard soil.
*  We don't have erosion because our organic matter is up.
*  On our farm, using these principles,
*  we've gone in we've gone from 1% organic matter
*  to over 8% organic matter in the soil.
*  And every 1% holds another 20,000 gallons of water per acre.
*  Whoa. So, so if we so if we so in our 60 years
*  of being there in the show at Polyphase,
*  we have gone from 1% to 8 over 8%.
*  Let's just say that's seven clicks.
*  Seven times 20 is 140,000 gallons of water per acre
*  now that we can hold that we couldn't hold before.
*  And it's because of the grazing, the perennials
*  and the composting that's building up
*  the organic matter in the soil.
*  That could be done in California.
*  When you start talking about holding water,
*  it's not just about how much rainfall are we getting,
*  it's how much are we actually holding in the sponge
*  to reduce flooding and runoff and things like that.
*  So it sounds like your method could keep from the situation
*  they find with some farms of the rotting topsoil
*  where they have to constantly supplement.
*  But how would you how do you grow enough corn?
*  Like if you want to have like those monocrop agricultural fields
*  where you see hundreds and hundreds
*  and hundreds of acres of corn,
*  just corn or just soybeans or just alfalfa, whatever it is.
*  Like if you want to do those monocrop things,
*  how are you going to re-fertilize the soil
*  in the same manner with that large scale?
*  You don't have them.
*  You don't have those monocrop agricultural solutions.
*  There's corn is an amazing plant, so are soybeans.
*  So all I'm saying is that right now our corn crop in the US,
*  what is it, 30% goes to alcohol for fuel.
*  Well, that takes more energy than the fuel we get.
*  So ethanol you mean?
*  Ethanol, yeah.
*  We don't need that.
*  Ethanol is a byproduct of what we used to think
*  that we needed ethanol.
*  Exactly, because we're running out of gas.
*  Right, right.
*  So that's not necessary.
*  Thank you, fracking.
*  Yeah.
*  That's not good either, though.
*  So we don't need to grow that corn.
*  Well, you know, come on electric vehicles and that,
*  I mean, that's changing the landscape a lot.
*  But isn't a lot of it for agriculture?
*  Well, yeah.
*  So then the next is to feed cattle.
*  So another huge percentage, like 20%, goes to feed cattle.
*  And then another huge percent goes to hogs and chickens,
*  of course.
*  But one of the problems with the hogs and chickens
*  is that they are not integrated with the food system.
*  So right now, 50%, almost 50%, it's
*  arguable, you know, what statistician, again,
*  figures lie and liars figure.
*  But somewhere between 40% and 50% of human edible food
*  on the planet is never eaten by a human.
*  It spoils, it's thrown away, and 75%
*  of everything that goes in the landfills is biodegradable.
*  So when you start matching up the waste, the waste
*  streams and the losses in our food system and our waste
*  streams, what happens is very quickly,
*  you start seeing that it's the segregated,
*  it's this single species, single crop,
*  single segregated notion where it's not related,
*  it's not symbiotic, it's not synergistic, that actually
*  creates the problem.
*  A city in Belgium, this was articulated
*  in Pat Forman's wonderful book, the title is City Chicks.
*  And she's talking about urban chickens.
*  A city in Belgium offered three chickens per household
*  to anybody that wanted a chicken.
*  And they had 2,000 families raise their hands, says,
*  yeah, we'll take three chickens.
*  So they got 6,000 chickens, distributed them
*  through this city.
*  And in the first month, it dropped 100 tons of food waste
*  to the landfill.
*  What?
*  And so not only did they eliminate the landfill waste,
*  all these people now suddenly had chickens.
*  And Pat's done all the math on this
*  and shows that if one in three households
*  had enough chickens to eat your kitchen scraps,
*  there would not be an egg industry in the United States.
*  It would be completely non-essential.
*  Really?
*  So that's the power of integration.
*  That's the power of approximate of actual putting stuff close
*  to each other.
*  So they wouldn't have an egg industry
*  because everyone would be growing their own eggs.
*  Everybody have their own eggs.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  And the landfill would get way, way less material.
*  And so then the chickens don't need the corn
*  from the corn fields.
*  So the fields can be turned back into prairie
*  to feed herbivores, which now would be cows, not bison.
*  But that's our herbivore of value.
*  And so now you're at perennials instead of annuals.
*  And perennials instead of annuals,
*  perennials put energy in the soil.
*  Annuals extract energy from the soil.
*  So now suddenly you're producing,
*  instead of producing an annual fertilized with petroleum
*  to feed beef for somebody else, instead you're
*  not growing the corn.
*  You don't need the tractor.
*  You don't need the petroleum.
*  The cows fertilize it themselves.
*  And the perennial builds the soil like it did with the bison.
*  And you have the beef, instead of coming out of a feedlot,
*  it's coming off the prairie like the bison did.
*  And suddenly you're building soils that are losing soil.
*  And your production doesn't change one iota.
*  It doesn't take any more land to produce
*  the beef with what I've described
*  than what it does with corn.
*  Doesn't take any more land.
*  OK, so you're essentially saying that they
*  have to convert to not just growing corn.
*  That's right.
*  They're going to have to do a different kind of farm.
*  That's right.
*  That's right.
*  Corn is, I mean, that kind of monocrop, monospeciated thing
*  is a complete, I mean, we started the interview talking
*  about standing on nature on her neck, you know.
*  That is a quintessential example of standing on nature's neck.
*  And the reason our farm was so deteriorated
*  when we came to it was because we're in Virginia Shenandoah
*  Valley.
*  And that was the breadbasket of the Confederacy
*  during the Civil War, if you know your history.
*  And essentially the war was finally
*  won when they burned all the crops in the Shenandoah Valley.
*  And during that time, the valley lost somewhere
*  between three and five feet of soil during that time period.
*  So the soils are worn out.
*  And then we got the westward expansion.
*  And it all moved to Ohio and Indiana.
*  And then finally the Dakotas and kept heading west.
*  So this head west, head west young man,
*  head west was partly because our agriculture destroyed
*  the soils.
*  And if we don't start using our agriculture to build soils,
*  we have a lot more to worry about than a COVID-19 deal.
*  A lot more to worry about.
*  If we don't figure out a way to produce food abundantly
*  and grow soil while we're doing it,
*  the pandemic is going to be the least of our concerns.
*  There's a thing that keeps getting repeated.
*  And it's that we only have 60 more seasons
*  left in our topsoil.
*  This is a thing that gets repeated almost as
*  if there's no solution to this.
*  That because we have to feed so many people, we're doomed.
*  And what you're saying is, no, we just
*  can't do it this way because this way is unsustainable.
*  It's unnatural to begin with.
*  That's exactly right.
*  So we have to fundamentally change.
*  We have to use our carbon, our biomass,
*  strategically, which includes food scraps, by the way.
*  Use everything strategically.
*  You can't just throw stuff away.
*  Right.
*  It shouldn't be.
*  This is sunlight that's supposed to be decomposed.
*  The fact that landfills get green environmental awards
*  for poking methane tubes in the landfill
*  and running the excavation equipment on the methane
*  from the decomposing material in a landfill, it's.
*  Shouldn't be in there.
*  No, it's unconscionable.
*  What we need to do is hook up.
*  We need hookups.
*  We need to where the waste streams,
*  like they move right into the use streams.
*  And you have circles, not linear thinking.
*  And just another one, for example, is ponds.
*  A lot of people don't realize that before the Europeans came
*  to North America, North America was 8% water.
*  Today, we're less than 1%.
*  I mean, surface area.
*  Think about the United States being 80% water, including.
*  8%, right?
*  I'm sorry, 8%.
*  I mean, think about that in Utah, Nevada, New Mexico.
*  Where'd all that water come from?
*  Beavers.
*  Massive, massive beaver populations.
*  I mean, there were 200 million beavers.
*  And we now know, archaeologically digging
*  up skeletons, some of them were as big as a Volkswagen car.
*  Really?
*  These were big.
*  The megafauna is incredible.
*  I mean, it's the same as the wombats in Australia.
*  Now these wombats are like 80 pounds,
*  or cute little wombats.
*  Well, they know by digging up skeletons,
*  they used to have nine foot wombats in Australia.
*  Nine foot wombats.
*  So when we look at the megafauna that was here,
*  the fact is that the planet used to have more animal weight
*  on it than it does today with all the animals,
*  all the factory farms, and all the people.
*  So it's not people and animals that are messing up the planet.
*  It's the human management of the ecosystem that's messing up.
*  The abundance here is through the roof.
*  So imagine if we, and this is what we've been doing on our farm,
*  is every time we get a few extra dollars,
*  we build another pond.
*  Now we're not beavers, but we have excavation equipment
*  that we can go in and build ponds so that when we have a flood
*  and everything is flooding, we're actually trapping a lot of that,
*  not all of it, but trapping a lot of it up on high ground,
*  permaculture style, that we can then dispense for irrigation
*  in a dry time so that we never pump from an aquifer.
*  That's the commons.
*  When you pump from an aquifer, you're depleting the commons.
*  But if you're reducing flooding and using that in a drought
*  to keep vegetation growing when there's so much sunlight,
*  then you're actually increasing the commons.
*  And we believe very strongly that as a result of our farming,
*  we should not be depleting the commons.
*  We should be increasing the commons.
*  As a result of our, there should be more soil, more water,
*  more breathable air, more wildlife, more pollinators, more...
*  There's also been a false narrative
*  that it attributes most of our greenhouse gases
*  to a significant number, a significant percentage
*  of our greenhouse gases coming from cows and cow agriculture.
*  And one of the things that they found
*  through using satellite imaging and when they were trying to detect methane,
*  they're finding it's landfills.
*  These landfills are a huge, huge problem in terms of greenhouse gases.
*  That the total wrong way of approaching it, the way you were saying,
*  burying this biological material in the ground instead of using it as compost
*  is actually not just counterproductive, but it's actually detrimental.
*  Yes.
*  It's not the wrong way to do it because it doesn't serve the soil.
*  Yeah.
*  It actually fucks up the air.
*  It's not a zero. It's a negative.
*  It's a negative.
*  Yeah.
*  It really is.
*  The same amount of biological material.
*  It's just managed incorrectly, which is really crazy
*  when you stop and think about it.
*  Sure it is.
*  If all the biomass that we have,
*  what's the word, non-leveraged or thrown away,
*  if all the biomass we've thrown away in the last 100 years,
*  if it had instead been leveraged for soil building, feeding chickens,
*  I mean, whatever, today,
*  we would not have all that methane.
*  And today, we would have soils that would be a lot richer
*  and we would have better earthworm populations.
*  We'd have a tremendous amount of soil,
*  maintained soil abundant fertility.
*  And so the beautiful thing is that this is not that difficult to bring back.
*  I mean, I've been preaching this message all my life,
*  and it's exciting to now suddenly have people stepping back and realize,
*  wow, we just kind of put a pause button and there are now
*  dolphins in Venice again.
*  In Shanghai, you can see across the street.
*  How about LA?
*  Yeah, LA. I mean, amazing pictures.
*  Amazing pictures.
*  So when people say, let's get back to normal.
*  Look, I don't want the tragedy that we're having,
*  but I also don't want to go back to normal,
*  because normal was this foot on nature's neck saying,
*  you know, we're going to...
*  So that's where you start saying, well, you know,
*  what does the future look like?
*  What could a future look like?
*  And that's where we start talking about decentralization, integration,
*  integrating all of our streams and...
*  Large scale change.
*  Oh, very large scale change.
*  Very disruptive.
*  Very disruptive.
*  But everybody has a job.
*  Everybody has a new thing.
*  I mean, my thing about the carbon economy, of course,
*  we're there in that hardwood region of Virginia,
*  near the Blue Ridge Parkway, Shenandoah National Park, all that stuff.
*  And the federal forest, the forest is a very large,
*  forests are atrocious.
*  I mean, dead trees.
*  The fuel buildup is just ridiculous.
*  Wouldn't it be cool if Mommy or Daddy could come home
*  and their six-year-old says, you know,
*  what did you do today?
*  And Mommy and Daddy are able to say,
*  well, we stewarded, you know, five acres up on Jack Mountain
*  and kept it from having a fuel load to burn
*  and took that biomass so that a farmer could feed his earthworms
*  so there'd be soil for your future.
*  There'll be abundance and soil for your future.
*  I mean, what an affirming, sacred, righteous vocation that would be.
*  And it would affirm people who want to work outside
*  and have calluses and blisters on their hands.
*  You know, we've spent a couple generations marginalizing
*  what we call blue-collar people.
*  And one of the big issues right now as we go to an AI,
*  you know, a techno future,
*  is what do we do with people that like to work outside
*  with their hands and sweat, you know, the Michael Rowe,
*  the dirty jobs?
*  I'm suggesting that a carbon economy
*  is one of many pathways
*  to actually envisioning a future
*  where thousands and thousands of people
*  would be employed in healing ministries
*  so that we'd be caressing our nest.
*  You know, so many times the idea in agriculture
*  and the farming community is that nature is a...
*  Nature is a reluctant partner
*  that we've got to get them in a wrestling hole.
*  We've got to dominate and conquistador.
*  We're going to make you, you know, we're going to push you.
*  When actually, nature is a benevolent lover
*  that just wants to be caressed.
*  And we haven't put attention
*  on caressing in the right places for a long time.
*  Isn't it also that when you say the word we,
*  God, there's so many of us
*  and so many people are already invested
*  in doing these jobs
*  that are actually counterproductive for nature.
*  Right.
*  Like these people that run these monocrop farms
*  for soybeans or what have you.
*  Like, boy, that's a battleship
*  that's going to be difficult to turn around.
*  It is, but the power...
*  So you say, well, where do you start?
*  Well, you start at your dinner plate.
*  And that's why at our farm,
*  our little moniker on our little, you know,
*  our little cooler bags
*  is healing the land one bite at a time.
*  We want our people to know
*  that what's on your plate
*  when it's multiplied a billion times,
*  you know, that actually creates the legacy,
*  the legacy ecology
*  you're leaving for your grandchildren.
*  That, somehow, that has to be made.
*  And people have to understand that.
*  And I think that the wake-up call,
*  the shock, the jar,
*  the emotional jarring of this pandemic,
*  we're seeing for the first time
*  people who never would have darkened our door
*  or asked us for anything,
*  they're asking us.
*  And that's why, you know,
*  that's why C and I wrote this book, Beyond Labels.
*  And we started this a year ago.
*  We had no idea that it would launch in the middle of this.
*  But we realized, hey, this is a timely thing.
*  We're having people call me,
*  can I go buy land near you that you'll manage
*  so I have a bunker?
*  You know, when things go wonky.
*  I mean, for the first time,
*  I've never heard this before,
*  but it's happening around the country.
*  People like us, we're getting calls,
*  how can I get on your first class list?
*  How can I get on your business class?
*  For the first time in our history,
*  we've been in business now for half a century.
*  We were in it before organic was cool.
*  We were one of those early,
*  and for 30 years,
*  we were the only game in town.
*  That was fun.
*  And 20 years ago, things as people started
*  awareness and farmers markets and all this.
*  So now we're not by any means the game in town.
*  So for the first time in half a century,
*  we're actually rationing product.
*  We don't have enough.
*  We've got way more demand.
*  I did a post the other day,
*  the pandemic is the best marketing strategy
*  we've ever had.
*  For you guys.
*  For us, okay?
*  We're rationing here.
*  So now our people are getting scared.
*  So there are farmers like us
*  that are actually talking about
*  starting kind of an insurance premium.
*  You want to get on our business class list
*  so you always have a seat.
*  Pay us $500 a year in premium
*  and you're our top 10 percenter.
*  So they would have definite access to food.
*  Definitely.
*  Definite access for food first.
*  How much could you scale up your business?
*  It has limits,
*  but our ability to scale
*  is only based on
*  the amount of money that we have.
*  We have to have enough
*  land-based personnel.
*  How many people?
*  And land-based.
*  We've got to have enough
*  land-based to scale and we need
*  a bigger team.
*  But no, our principles,
*  but see we don't scale,
*  let me explain it this way.
*  There's a guy.
*  David Schaeffer.
*  He does a cool thing.
*  As you know,
*  our country is now a repository
*  for shipping containers.
*  Metal shipping containers.
*  We've got millions of them. You can buy them.
*  Cheap scrap metal.
*  Because China makes everything, ships it here,
*  and we don't ship anything back but
*  microchips.
*  So they don't take very many shipping containers.
*  So we're building up these mountains
*  of shipping containers.
*  So this guy has figured out
*  how to take a shipping container
*  and simply refurbish it into
*  a small, inspectable
*  poultry processing,
*  mobile poultry processing facility.
*  So I can call him
*  and for $100,000
*  he'll customize it
*  to what I want, put a chassis
*  under it, drive it to my place,
*  put it on four pillars. It's not even a building
*  so there's no building permit required.
*  Put it on four pillars
*  and I've got a little
*  federal-inspected processing facility that I can do
*  you know, 150,000
*  chickens a year. Okay?
*  So
*  for me, when you say how do you
*  scale up, for me
*  it's not, well
*  I'm going to, if we hit 150
*  and overrun the ability of this
*  little facility, it's called Platinum Box.
*  P.I.B.
*  And his pot, his
*  blog is
*  thinking inside the box.
*  Because his thing is Platinum Box.
*  So instead of, if we had
*  sales for over 150,000 chickens
*  well then
*  you don't expand
*  this and make it bigger, you duplicate
*  it. So your expansion is by
*  duplication, not by
*  concentration and
*  scale on site. Then what happens
*  there's a sweet spot here, there's a sweet spot.
*  If you
*  don't overrun
*  your ecology, so we're going to
*  set this thing, you set this thing on a
*  farm, so
*  the acreage is
*  enough to handle the processing water
*  and you compost all the guts on
*  site. Now
*  you don't have to run a sewage treatment
*  plant. You don't have to truck
*  your guts to a rendering plant.
*  They become fertilizer
*  on site, called this
*  fertigation, and
*  it's a sweet spot
*  that the industry doesn't
*  have. And so
*  there's no reason why we can't produce a million
*  chickens and you just have
*  eight of these scattered, you know,
*  five miles apart,
*  six miles apart.
*  And once you get them processed
*  and they're in a bag, you can
*  put them in a tractor trailer and ship them
*  anywhere, okay?
*  That's not the bottleneck.
*  The bottleneck is integrating
*  the processing with the production.
*  That's the bottleneck. Right now
*  in our fragile system.
*  And so if we can do an integrative
*  approach
*  and have a democratized,
*  decentralized approach,
*  then suddenly we have
*  an ecological, humane,
*  people-friendly,
*  community-friendly,
*  nutrient-friendly system.
*  Has anybody ever come to you and said,
*  hey, our community is
*  kind of screwed up, we don't have a good food source here,
*  would you help us establish something
*  like this?
*  Yeah, I've been...
*  Have you designed these things for folks?
*  Not, I mean,
*  not for a whole community like this.
*  It sounds like that would be a great thing,
*  though. Especially now when we're realizing
*  that it's difficult, when
*  the food supply chain goes down
*  or something goes wrong and it's difficult to get
*  food to people, wouldn't it be great
*  to have, I've always said this, that
*  it would be great if you had like, the
*  neighborhood had like one large
*  plot of land and everyone in
*  the neighborhood lived off that plot of land.
*  Instead of like, have a little mini
*  central park in every neighborhood.
*  Right, right.
*  You're talking my language.
*  I mean, the idea of...
*  I mean, you're familiar
*  with urban agriculture.
*  I mean, we have food
*  deserts, right? Food deserts is a big, big
*  problem. But a lot of times, food deserts are
*  in pretty run-down parts of the city
*  that have vacant lots.
*  And
*  there's a lot of productive
*  capacity in these places.
*  One of the interesting
*  ones I was on was in St. Louis.
*  And these three young couples
*  had come together and they had
*  purchased an old, it was an old
*  crack house that the city
*  bulldozed. So there's this vacant lot.
*  It was, you know, half an acre. It wasn't very big.
*  Half an acre.
*  And these three couples,
*  they got
*  apartments nearby, like within,
*  you know, two minutes walk.
*  And it was in a pretty run-down area of the city,
*  a run-down neighborhood.
*  And they just started farming in this
*  half acre.
*  And told all the neighbors,
*  bring us your food scraps. They got some chickens.
*  They started making compost.
*  They put up a little greenhouse.
*  They put up a kitchen.
*  And very, very simple
*  poor boy bootstrap, you know,
*  nothing. And
*  they quickly became
*  a whole community
*  of, um,
*  whatever, uh,
*  place
*  for kids to come
*  because kids were mesmerized
*  by the chickens.
*  They had a worm bed.
*  The plants growing. They cooked stuff.
*  And I
*  was there, you know, I was there with them
*  for a couple of hours. And here come, here
*  come kids down the sidewalk, you know, pulling
*  a little red wagon with food scraps
*  in it. And they're feeding the
*  worm beds. And it's
*  fantastic. They were feeding
*  like, you know, 30 families
*  out of this
*  old crack house foundation.
*  That's amazing. And it was just
*  wonderful. And they were doing it
*  as a gift to the inner
*  city, you know, as a gift
*  to the inner city. But I asked
*  them, I said, so how much of
*  St. Louis's food could be produced this way?
*  They said, if you take out the
*  dairy and the beef,
*  you know, the big, the big mega
*  stuff, St. Louis
*  could feed its
*  entire city within the city limits
*  this way. And
*  that's true in Detroit. It's
*  true in Baltimore.
*  It might not be true in LA,
*  but the,
*  but here's the thing.
*  We don't have to solve
*  every single person's problem
*  to start solving some.
*  And our problem
*  is so many times I start down this
*  path and somebody starts throwing at me
*  the most extreme situation.
*  And you know what? I don't have
*  all the answers for the most extreme
*  situation. You know, the
*  single mom of four, minority
*  in a food desert, in whatever,
*  okay? I don't have the answer
*  to every single situation.
*  But I'm looking at
*  suburbia. I'm looking
*  at incredible
*  things that people are doing
*  and opportunities. And if
*  we just did what we know,
*  I ran
*  into a lady in
*  Edmonton, British
*  Alberta.
*  And
*  she was 50, single lady, living
*  in a fifth floor
*  condominium, just
*  wanted to farm in the worst way.
*  She had no money, no land,
*  nothing.
*  And she just had this epiphany one day.
*  She said, I know I have one friend
*  that has a backyard. She went
*  to this friend with a backyard. She said,
*  would you mind if I grew up
*  like a 10 foot by 10 foot
*  garden in your backyard? I just want to grow
*  something. Friend said, sure, sure, sure.
*  So she gave her a little 10 by 10 plot,
*  started a garden.
*  Well, the lady's neighbor saw the
*  garden and she said, do you think
*  your friend would put a garden in my backyard?
*  And the lady said, well, no, I'll ask.
*  Well, sure.
*  I met this lady 18 months after
*  this initial conversation with her friend.
*  She was farming
*  18 backyards, had a part-time
*  employee, was a full-time
*  farmer.
*  Her, all of her
*  tools were on the side of her bicycle.
*  She bicycled from spot to spot
*  to spot with all of her tools
*  and she started a business called
*  On Borrowed Ground
*  and Growing Food.
*  So the thing
*  is, is there creativity?
*  Is there opportunity? Oh,
*  it's up the wazoo.
*  If we would become as interested in
*  this as we are the latest dysfunction
*  in the Kardashians. Or, you know,
*  the latest whatever.
*  And
*  it's not that we don't have time for it,
*  not that we don't have money for it.
*  If there's one really
*  positive thing to come out of this pandemic,
*  I hope that it's
*  a restructuring of what's
*  valuable in life.
*  And if we can, if we can even
*  grab a 30%
*  bump
*  in that value
*  trajectory,
*  it will have been the best thing that ever
*  happened to us. That's a large bump.
*  But yeah, if we can restructure
*  what's valuable to us, it's very
*  important. And as you were talking about
*  earlier, what's essential, these essential businesses,
*  what is essential and not essential?
*  It's so arbitrary
*  and strange. And this is something that politicians
*  really aren't supposed to have the power to
*  dictate what we can and can't do
*  in that way. And they're not doing it in a smart way.
*  Like, here's a perfect example. Liquor stores
*  are an essential business.
*  You know what's not an essential business?
*  Alcoholics Anonymous. So
*  Alcoholics Anonymous is not allowed to have their meetings.
*  But liquor stores are open because they're essential.
*  That is
*  absolutely not an essential business.
*  The government is not allowed to have their meetings.
*  That is absolutely not an essential business.
*  Yeah, and that's why I think
*  that's why the government is so
*  important.
*  Yeah, and it's not a question of
*  people going to the liquor stores and asking
*  questions. They're not asking questions
*  that are just asked backwards thinking.
*  That doesn't make any sense.
*  Absolutely. Yeah, in Virginia,
*  I mean, yeah, we've got ours in Virginia as well.
*  They open the liquor stores and close the
*  stores. That's my argument. But boy,
*  fear, you know,
*  fear,
*  fear spawns things that we can't
*  even imagine.
*  What is it like where you are in Virginia?
*  Are restaurants open? No.
*  No.
*  So on May 15th,
*  we entered what's called Phase 1.
*  And so
*  churches are allowed
*  to meet again.
*  Not that the government could have
*  ever taken that away. But anyway, that's
*  the narrative.
*  That's the narrative.
*  Churches can meet again. We're still at the
*  10 person
*  rule for
*  gatherings.
*  But a church, as long as they're at 50 percent
*  capacity, they're okay.
*  So that's
*  up and running. Hairdressers
*  are back to work. A lot of the
*  personal hygiene. Barbers,
*  hairdressers,
*  you know,
*  small, very
*  small scale
*  kind of things like that are
*  back. But it's
*  a slow, you know, it's a very,
*  very slow process. Yeah, it is.
*  In some places, Texas is pretty wide open.
*  Texas has restaurants, hotels,
*  everything's back up.
*  Phoenix is the same way.
*  Right. Right. Places
*  are opening up comedy clubs again
*  at half capacity. Right.
*  So, I mean, we're having our, we canceled
*  our first two farm tours. We do
*  a, we do what we call the Lunatic Farm
*  Tour at the farm.
*  A hundred people on haywagons.
*  Obviously, we can't social distance on haywagons.
*  You can't get people. Right. So we're having
*  our first one May 30th.
*  It's sold out.
*  Not a single person has complained.
*  We've told them there won't be social distancing.
*  You're on a haywagon. If
*  you're uncomfortable, then you can
*  walk the tour. And we don't drive fast.
*  We don't drive fast. You know, we've got people on haywagons.
*  We're not, you know, we're not driving
*  at road speed. So you can
*  walk it if you want to. But
*  our impression
*  of the feedback we've gotten is just
*  relief.
*  Finally, I can go somewhere.
*  I can be with people. I can,
*  you know. That's the plus side, right?
*  We're going to appreciate what it's like
*  to do stuff.
*  To be able to go outside, to go to
*  a restaurant, to go to a public gathering,
*  to have a picnic. Yes. That kind of stuff.
*  Yes. Yes. I think all of our
*  of our historically
*  normal social interactions
*  are going to be
*  much sweeter than they
*  have been in the past. Because we're social beings.
*  We're not hermits.
*  A few of us are hermits, but not very many.
*  Most of us
*  like to see people.
*  And if there's one time when you want
*  to be together, it's in
*  hard times. Yes. Who wants to go
*  through hard times alone? And when I see
*  these World War II vets
*  dying alone
*  because their family can't be around
*  them,
*  the guy, you know,
*  he's dying.
*  Who cares?
*  If son and daughter and
*  grandkids want to come and be
*  around him. I just...
*  Well, the fear is that they'll get it and they'll give it
*  to someone else. Right. Right. And someone else will wind up
*  in terminal as well. I understand.
*  One of our problems is that we haven't done
*  controls.
*  You know, I wish
*  there had been one state that said, we're not going
*  to do anything, so that there could be one control.
*  Right.
*  But the problem is, nobody's
*  done a control, so we really
*  don't know. Well, there's been places
*  that have less restrictions
*  than others, and then also there's
*  been countries that have less restrictions than others.
*  Sweden. Yeah. So, and you're
*  getting... It's really difficult to
*  parse the information and get a
*  straight answer on... It is. Is this a
*  good thing or a bad thing? Ultimately,
*  over the course of time, particularly
*  what you were talking about with the unemployment rate
*  equaling, you know, 1% equaling
*  30,000 lives over the course of a year.
*  I mean, we really don't know
*  what that number is going to look like here, and it
*  could be absolutely devastating.
*  It is. I mean, we already know that
*  suicides are up,
*  child abuse is up, spousal abuse
*  is up. We know that just from police
*  reports. So, you know, that's serious.
*  And there are so many demographics that we
*  don't know. Like Sweden, for example,
*  50, 55%
*  of all households in Sweden
*  are single, single person.
*  They must be really
*  unagreeable people.
*  That's crazy. 55%?
*  Yeah, yeah, it's over 50%.
*  Maybe they're just swingers or something.
*  In Italy,
*  it's only, I think,
*  18 or 20%,
*  something like that. So,
*  so there's a lot of multi-generational
*  households in Italy.
*  Italy's a much older
*  demographic, and
*  more people in a household.
*  Probably a lot more smoking in Sweden.
*  Italy is, I was there,
*  it's ridiculous how much they smoke.
*  Same thing in Spain, Spain, a lot of
*  smoking. And they got hit hard as well, right?
*  Yes, they did. And you gotta imagine that's going to
*  lead to a compromised immune system.
*  So you've got all the people living together, you've got
*  a large percentage of
*  folks that are older, and then you got
*  the cigarettes and the no exercise.
*  The gyms
*  that I found when I was in Italy, like what in
*  the fuck is this gym?
*  Even a nice hotel would have this pathetic
*  gym. Yeah, yeah.
*  There's nobody working out over there.
*  That's true.
*  That's true. And as
*  we go forward with this thing,
*  I
*  I look at this and say,
*  well let's at least
*  wipe ourselves off and say, okay,
*  what can I learn from this? What can we
*  learn from this going forward?
*  And
*  culturally,
*  obviously, we can learn,
*  we need to
*  decentralize and diversify our food
*  processing system. I mean, for me, that's like
*  number one.
*  And
*  then for the average
*  consumer, though, I mean, that's a macro
*  thing, but for the average consumer, what can you do
*  to facilitate
*  a secure food system and your own
*  secure food system?
*  And one, one
*  is to simply start
*  stockpiling more food. I mean, have more
*  food in the house.
*  You don't have to go to the grocery store three
*  times a week. Buy in bulk.
*  Go to the farmer's market, buy
*  from a farmer. You can get, you can get
*  20 pound bags of
*  oatmeal. You know, you don't have to get
*  a little, you know, cup
*  full of Quaker oats. You can
*  get, you can get rolled crimped oats
*  by the 50 pound bag. It's
*  pennies on the
*  dollar. I mean, this is how you save money. You buy
*  and I mean, we
*  talk about price. Interestingly,
*  our whole chicken
*  price at Polyface
*  is cheaper than
*  boneless skinless breast from Tyson
*  at Wal-Mart.
*  So the way to save money is to get
*  unprocessed.
*  That's how you eat well.
*  Okay. You know, the famous movie
*  Food Inc.
*  The documentary Food Inc.
*  Wonderful movie, but they
*  presented the same thing. Remember that family went
*  to the fast food place
*  and they said they couldn't afford tomatoes?
*  Well, a pound of our ground
*  beef is cheaper than that
*  burger, soft drink,
*  and massive
*  fries that he got.
*  And there's probably more nutrition in
*  a half a pound of our ground meat than that whole
*  meal. But you
*  can buy two pounds of our ground meat for the price
*  of that whole meal.
*  The fact is that junk food is not
*  cheap. Junk food's
*  expensive. I mean, you start talking about nutrition.
*  I mean, a Snickers bar.
*  Snickers bar is
*  twice as expensive per pound
*  as our grass-finished
*  world-class ground beef.
*  Okay?
*  So when you start looking at these kinds
*  of things, you start realizing, oh, okay,
*  so really, I just
*  need to adjust
*  where my money's going.
*  So spend
*  bulk by bulk
*  by unprocessed.
*  Get in your kitchen, yes.
*  And
*  develop
*  a love
*  for domestic culinary arts.
*  Okay?
*  And kitchens are a great place to teach your kids
*  science, you know, fractions, a quarter
*  teaspoon. Great place to teach your
*  kids, so math,
*  math fractions and stuff. Science,
*  you know, what happens when you put baking soda with
*  vinegar and all this stuff. I mean,
*  you know, kitchen's a great first-learning
*  place. What you're saying is great
*  on paper. The problem is people are addicted to eating
*  terrible foods. Yeah. And it's
*  a real issue, particularly with
*  highly sweetened, highly processed
*  foods that are the things they crave.
*  And also, their gut biome.
*  You were talking about this doctor,
*  what is his name, Bush? Dr.
*  Zach Bush. Dr. Zach Bush.
*  And that he's a biome
*  expert. I'm glad we brought this up as well.
*  Because that's an issue with people that
*  their body's accustomed to eating this terrible
*  food. Their biome is accustomed
*  to that terrible food, so it starts
*  craving those Twinkies
*  and chips. Oh, listen. The food,
*  the food processing scientists,
*  they ain't
*  dumb. No. They know
*  what our, you know, what
*  our primitive,
*  you know, hot buttons
*  are. And
*  yeah, salty, sweetie.
*  I mean, boy, they know exactly
*  what it is. So, yeah, so
*  Dr. Zach Bush has been actually developing
*  microbiome
*  bolstering concoctions
*  to try to diversify your microbiome.
*  You know, one of the things that
*  farmers like me that direct market
*  to people,
*  one of our concerns, I mean, I don't
*  talk a lot about it, but one of our
*  concerns is that
*  our food, for example, our chicken,
*  we don't immerse it in chlorine.
*  You know, so it actually has,
*  it's living food.
*  And
*  sometimes
*  people are so sterile
*  in their microbiome
*  that they actually have to eat
*  a little bit of unprocessed,
*  you know, of real food a little bit
*  at a time to build it up.
*  I mean, the other morning I was out in the garden
*  picking
*  asparagus. And
*  I had my knife and I was
*  cutting it off. Of course, I love fresh,
*  I mean, fresh garden pick.
*  I mean, there's nothing like a cool
*  morning and a big old fat asparagus,
*  you know, an inch thick.
*  And I just eat it fresh. It's got some
*  soil on it. Eat the soil.
*  You know, just
*  grandma used to say you're supposed to eat a
*  pound of dirt before you're 12,
*  right? Remember? I mean,
*  I had a different grandma.
*  Oh, man.
*  But,
*  you know, how do we develop immune
*  systems in babies? We don't
*  put them in plastic wrap bubble.
*  We put them around the floor and the next thing we know
*  they're, you know,
*  gnawing on the dog toy
*  and they've got a dust bunny in their mouth
*  and, right, this is how you
*  build an immune system. And kids kind of know,
*  or nature knows it at least. Nature knows
*  that. I mean, Richard Louv
*  writes about this in Nature Deficit
*  Disorder, which is, of course, an iconic
*  book about
*  the importance of
*  touching nature and breathing
*  in nature. I mean, just the
*  bacteria that exudes
*  from vegetation and
*  the ecology of plants.
*  Powerful
*  thing, you know. And we're told to wash
*  things down as soon as you get them
*  because they get to have pesticides on
*  them. You got to clean up all the
*  garbage and tar if you get any
*  coli from the spinach. That's why you get food
*  from people that don't use pesticides.
*  And you say, well,
*  there's not enough of that produced. Well,
*  as you said,
*  it would be
*  wonderful if this
*  broadcast went into
*  every single household in the world,
*  and tomorrow everybody
*  said, we're going to do different.
*  I think a lot of people are trying to do different
*  because of this pandemic. I mean, I would imagine
*  the number of gardens has grown up substantially.
*  I know a lot of people have looked
*  into hunting. I know that.
*  And edible, you know,
*  hunting edible wild
*  things. What can I eat? You know, dandelions,
*  lamb's quarters, mushrooms.
*  Yep, yep, yep. It's a wonderful thing.
*  So, yes, this is really
*  a good thing.
*  And the whole, what we call
*  the Homestead Arts, there's a
*  big conference that happens every year
*  in the East. They're hoping that they can
*  still have it. It's in October. The Homesteaders
*  of America conference.
*  And two weeks ago,
*  they had 10,000
*  new email
*  signups for their
*  postings in one day.
*  I mean,
*  that gets your attention. That's huge.
*  And it's
*  people that are looking on how to
*  garden. I mean, the
*  number of gardening questions,
*  just like
*  and seeds. I mean, seed companies
*  are out. All the seed companies
*  basically did like a three or four day moratorium
*  this spring, you know, because they ran out.
*  So this summer was going to be in short supply.
*  Canning supplies are going to be short.
*  Dehydrators,
*  I'm sure, you know, produce
*  dehydrators are going to be hard to get.
*  In our area right now,
*  you cannot get a freezer now until
*  August. Everything's backordered clear
*  until the middle of August. Everybody
*  snarfed up the freezers to be able to
*  stockpile. So that was one of the things I was
*  saying. You know, how do we go forward?
*  Well, you
*  do more for yourself. And in our
*  book, Beyond Labels, Seen and I
*  end up, the last couple chapters
*  are about moving
*  to a place where you actually are
*  producing some of your own food,
*  a backyard flock of chickens,
*  a little garden,
*  a little herb garden,
*  you know, and we have the technology
*  now, Mother Earth News magazine. I mean,
*  they've led
*  this thing forever.
*  And you go to a
*  Mother Earth News Fair
*  and we were going to have
*  the first one on a farm this year at our
*  place, respecting 10,000 people.
*  We had to cancel it. It was in July. So
*  it's rolled over now to next year. But
*  there's
*  every kind of like, you know, like patio
*  tube herb garden with little pockets
*  in it, you know, and you grow all of your
*  own herbs. Beehives on your
*  house roof.
*  There's so much, there's
*  so much that you can do.
*  And so I
*  encourage people to jump in
*  and just caress the
*  mystery of life.
*  And it's
*  good for your nutrition. It's good for your soul.
*  It's good for your spirit. In a time
*  where everybody's concerned about death,
*  surround yourself with something that's
*  growing. It's a great
*  thing, you know. I think that's
*  a great point and maybe a great way to end
*  this. Joel, thank you very much.
*  I really appreciate you and I appreciate your message
*  and
*  you really epitomize
*  the best example
*  of that sort of regenerative farming.
*  I really wish it would be more
*  widespread. Thank you, Joel.
*  With your help, it will be. My pleasure.
*  Alright, bye everybody.
