# Joe Rogan Experience #2015 - Zach Bryan
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day! [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6.0s)]
*  What's happening baby? Good to see you brother. How you doing? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10.0s)]
*  And we're drinking Bud Lights ladies and gentlemen. Sorry guys. Sorry. We're fucked. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=16.0s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with it. Mm-mm. People are so... Cheers sir. Cheers brother. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=20.0s)]
*  People are so silly. We were just talking about how silly it is. One person made a really stupid decision [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=24.0s)]
*  Now everybody's decided that Bud Light is the enemy. But that's like this thing that people do in America [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=29.0s)]
*  Where they just decide, now I hate these people. These people are the enemy. And you know. And it's over. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=34.0s)]
*  Yeah and it's over. The reason I've been drinking Bud Light and Bud Lights is like my entire adult life [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=39.0s)]
*  And then on Twitter I defended my sister's spouse and people were like, people were pissed. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=46.0s)]
*  And I was like I didn't mean to do this. It was crazy. And Travis Trick came after me and I was like [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=53.0s)]
*  He didn't come after me. Travis Trick is so respectable and he's like a good guy. And I met him at the Two Step Inn [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=57.0s)]
*  Where you were. And it was just, it was cool to get to talk to him about it and see like two different views. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=62.0s)]
*  And it was cool sitting in the room with him and hearing it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=66.0s)]
*  Well you know people, just the culture war in this country is so goofy. It's so overblown. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=70.0s)]
*  And a lot of it is people just not talking to each other. It's people talking through social media [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=75.0s)]
*  And talking through narratives and it's just... It freaks me out. Yeah. It freaks me out. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=80.0s)]
*  And being so public, you too as well, it's so scary. I feel like it keeps people from being who they actually are. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=85.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. Which is terrifying because every time I get anywhere I'm like shit man I can't say or do this [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=90.0s)]
*  And then when you do it's fucking, it's crazy. It's psychotic. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=95.0s)]
*  There's a lot of self-censoring but I think it's important to speak your mind. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=100.0s)]
*  I think it's getting better. Yeah it's just more people have to do it and then more people... [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=104.0s)]
*  You know people are worried about the repercussions but you have to understand that when you're a person like yourself [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=108.0s)]
*  Or a person like me, you're communicating to millions of people. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=113.0s)]
*  And so you're going to have a certain percentage of them that are upset at everything you say. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=117.0s)]
*  Whether you say you like to eat meat or whether you say you think Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is a good guy [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=121.0s)]
*  Or whether you think that you know, whatever the fuck you think. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=126.0s)]
*  And you only have one life man. Allegedly. Yeah I guess. Whoa. I'm not sure about that. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=130.0s)]
*  Do you ever have a feeling you've been here before? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=137.0s)]
*  No, I saw your podcast like two years ago about the infinity thing. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=140.0s)]
*  And I kept telling people about it. Like in Oklahoma and stuff. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=144.0s)]
*  Isn't it weird that that freaks people out? Like it freaks people out. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=147.0s)]
*  I love life. I love my family. I love my friends. I love my job. I love existing. I enjoy it very much. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=151.0s)]
*  But if I had to do this over and over again forever for infinity, it's a weird feeling. It freaks people out. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=158.0s)]
*  Have you seen that Black Mirror episode? No. Not to be that guy. No, I've seen a bunch of them. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=164.0s)]
*  There's a Black Mirror episode where they're in a cabin and this guy's in prison for infinity. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=168.0s)]
*  And he's talking to this guy over and over and over again. Wow. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=172.0s)]
*  And there's the new one. The new season came out. And same thing, they're in space and they're like coming down. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=175.0s)]
*  I'm not going to ruin it. No, no worries. It's crazy. It's an amazing show. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=179.0s)]
*  It freaks you out. It's my favorite show. It's a great show. My wife won't watch it with me. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=183.0s)]
*  Really? She gets freaked out by it. She doesn't like things that could be real. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=187.0s)]
*  I get that. I get that. A lot of people, when I bring it up, they're like, I don't know. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=192.0s)]
*  Did you ever see Heavy Metal? That's the one where the robots are chasing this lady? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=196.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. The dogs. I didn't like that. I stopped watching. That one freaked me out too much. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=201.0s)]
*  That's so close to real. Well, the one about the murdering too. There's a one where this chick murders. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=206.0s)]
*  And she gets in this white lie of trying to hide from it. She's hiding it from her kids and stuff. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=212.0s)]
*  Crazy. Wow. It's just so close to real. It's so close to real. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=219.0s)]
*  There was a World Economic Forum video that they just put out about people going to work and wearing earbuds. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=225.0s)]
*  Have you seen it, Jamie? Going to work and wearing earbuds that monitor your brain waves. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=232.0s)]
*  And the brain waves are going to tell whether or not you're being productive or distracted. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=238.0s)]
*  And in this video, this woman is kind of fantasizing about a guy she works with and then catches herself doing it. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=243.0s)]
*  And then some guy gets busted for like... Is this a show? What is this? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=248.0s)]
*  It's just a video explaining how in the future you're going to... See if you can find it. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=252.0s)]
*  I'm seeing the people talking about it. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=257.0s)]
*  Dude, you saying this reminds me of yesterday. I was in Walmart and I was walking around and I was looking for something to buy. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=259.0s)]
*  And one of the girls I asked the question to, she had an AirPod in. And I was like, why would you do that? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=264.0s)]
*  You're walking around working and people are asking you for help and stuff. And she's just walking around listening to... [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=270.0s)]
*  She's talking to people. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=274.0s)]
*  And listening to this music. Kids do that today. My kids do that. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=275.0s)]
*  They'll have one ear open. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=278.0s)]
*  I didn't mean to be an ass, but I was talking to the guy at the... [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=280.0s)]
*  Here it is. Yeah, that's it. Check this out. Check this video out. This is bonkers, dude. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=284.0s)]
*  This is really... [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=289.0s)]
*  ...to the left. And scroll through your brain data over the past few hours. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=290.0s)]
*  Oh, it's like one of those training videos. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=295.0s)]
*  As the deadline to finish your memo approach... [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=298.0s)]
*  Yeah, and she's wearing these earbuds. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=300.0s)]
*  ...has a peak in your beta brainwave activity right before an alert popped up telling you to take a brain break. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=301.0s)]
*  But what's that unusual change in your brain activity... [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=308.0s)]
*  This is not the one I saw. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=312.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=313.0s)]
*  This is another one that I saw that's... [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=314.0s)]
*  That's scarier than a Black Mirror episode, man. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=315.0s)]
*  The other one's more scary because it talks about self-centering at work and monitoring your thoughts at work. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=317.0s)]
*  I can see it. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=322.0s)]
*  God, I sent it to somebody. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=323.0s)]
*  I can see it. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=324.0s)]
*  What the fuck did I send it to? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=325.0s)]
*  I mean, this video on TikTok seems like I just saw the brainwave thing you just said. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=326.0s)]
*  Oh, come on. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=331.0s)]
*  Like that? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=333.0s)]
*  That's the same video. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=335.0s)]
*  Yep, this is it. This is it. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=336.0s)]
*  Oh, it's just a little later in there? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=337.0s)]
*  This is it, yeah. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=338.0s)]
*  Okay, so I had only seen part of it. That's it. Keep it rolling. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=339.0s)]
*  ...or his feelings telling you to take a brain break... [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=342.0s)]
*  Oh, you got two going. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=344.0s)]
*  Stop. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=346.0s)]
*  Oh my God, this is a nightmare. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=347.0s)]
*  This is Black Mirror. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=348.0s)]
*  This is what I hear at night. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=349.0s)]
*  ...when the email she sent you later that day. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=350.0s)]
*  Oh, this is fine. Let this play. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=354.0s)]
*  No, it's before this. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=357.0s)]
*  It's before this where she's fantasizing about this guy that she... [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=359.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. That's the guy. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=362.0s)]
*  How do you smoke pot and watch stuff like that? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=363.0s)]
*  I love it. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=365.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=366.0s)]
*  Back up. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=368.0s)]
*  The doctor. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=375.0s)]
*  No way. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=379.0s)]
*  Come on. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=380.0s)]
*  What? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=384.0s)]
*  Imagine all the shitty things you've thought of at work... [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=387.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=389.0s)]
*  ...and your boss knowing. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=390.0s)]
*  Congratulations on your brain metrics. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=391.0s)]
*  ...from the past quarter, which have earned you another performance bonus. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=394.0s)]
*  So you get bonuses. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=398.0s)]
*  ...you have come jamming to the music with your own [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=400.0s)]
*  ...for thinking a certain way. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=412.2s)]
*  Where is it going? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=418.2s)]
*  ...the cloud has fallen over the office. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=419.2s)]
*  Along with emails, text messages, and GPS location data, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=422.2s)]
*  the government has subpoenaed employees' brainwave data from the past year. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=427.2s)]
*  They have compelling evidence that one of your coworkers has committed massive wire fraud. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=432.2s)]
*  Now, they're looking for his co-conspirators. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=438.2s)]
*  You discover they are looking for synchronized brain activity [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=441.2s)]
*  between your coworker and the people he has been working with. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=445.2s)]
*  While you know you're innocent of any crime, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=449.2s)]
*  you've been secretly working with him on a new startup venture. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=451.2s)]
*  Shaking, you remove your earbuds. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=455.2s)]
*  You know what's crazy about that? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=458.2s)]
*  You know what's crazy about that? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=460.2s)]
*  I feel like the world right now with all of our phones is the same way. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=461.2s)]
*  Because your phone knows everything about you. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=464.2s)]
*  And people can do that. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=466.2s)]
*  But it's not the same. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=467.2s)]
*  It's getting there. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=468.2s)]
*  It feels like it. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=469.2s)]
*  The idea of being able to collect data on everywhere you walk. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=470.2s)]
*  I remember when I was... [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=473.2s)]
*  I guess it was like... [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=475.2s)]
*  I want to say it was like 99, 2000 was the first GPS thing that I had. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=477.2s)]
*  And you would load it, I think, with CDs or DVRs. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=482.2s)]
*  I remember when Garmin came out and my grandpa was going crazy. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=486.2s)]
*  He would put it on the dash of his truck and he was like, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=489.2s)]
*  we're going to Texas and we know where we're going. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=490.2s)]
*  Yeah, you had a map with you all the time. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=492.2s)]
*  But the one that I had in the early days, I only had California. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=494.2s)]
*  Because that's all the data could fit. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=498.2s)]
*  And the California data was on like a CD-ROM or a DVD. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=500.2s)]
*  I can't remember which one it was. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=503.2s)]
*  But you had to load it, I remember. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=505.2s)]
*  And it was kind of clunky. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=506.2s)]
*  But I was like, this is wild. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=508.2s)]
*  This is like very early on with that kind of electronics. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=510.2s)]
*  Thinking about it now, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=513.2s)]
*  what's freaked me out the most in the last year of my life has been friends of mine and people that I've met and things. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=514.2s)]
*  I got a flip phone like six months ago. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=521.2s)]
*  I was like, man, I called you on it. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=523.2s)]
*  When I first started talking to you, I was on my flip phone. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=524.2s)]
*  Because I was talking to a friend of mine and it was like, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=527.2s)]
*  they were like, well, how are you going to track? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=530.2s)]
*  How are you going to know where your friends are at? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=532.2s)]
*  Like with the tracking on iPhones and stuff like that, you can like see your friends. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=534.2s)]
*  I'm like, what do you mean? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=538.2s)]
*  I don't think we're supposed to know where we're all at. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=539.2s)]
*  And it's scary as shit. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=542.2s)]
*  Why do I want you to know that I'm at my house or if I'm even your best friends in the entire world? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=543.2s)]
*  Our parents never did that. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=547.2s)]
*  It's weird. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=548.2s)]
*  You know, it's crazy. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=549.2s)]
*  It's weird. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=550.2s)]
*  And then some people are going to want to know where you are all the time. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=551.2s)]
*  Why won't you let me know where you are, Zach? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=553.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's six years. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=555.2s)]
*  It's like seven years ago. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=556.2s)]
*  I saw the map with all the fucking heads on it. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=557.2s)]
*  And kids are growing up like this. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=560.2s)]
*  My kids use that constantly. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=562.2s)]
*  They're always tracking their friends. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=564.2s)]
*  I'm 27. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=565.2s)]
*  I'm not allowed to say that yet. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=566.2s)]
*  You're still a kid. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=567.2s)]
*  I don't know what age that is where you can start saying the kids, you know, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=568.2s)]
*  which is cringy to say. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=571.2s)]
*  You can say it at 27. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=572.2s)]
*  After 25, you can kind of say it occasionally. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=573.2s)]
*  That's how I feel. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=575.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=576.2s)]
*  After 25, I was like, holy fuck, man, life is not. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=577.2s)]
*  Then once you're 30, you're like, oh my God, I'm a grownup. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=579.2s)]
*  I was told at 30, you feel more. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=581.2s)]
*  I was told at 30, you feel like more settled. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=583.2s)]
*  Depends on who you are. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=585.2s)]
*  Sometimes people aren't happy at 30 and then they start panicking more [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=587.2s)]
*  because they haven't got anything done. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=590.2s)]
*  I fucking, I don't know about your 20s. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=592.2s)]
*  I don't know what you did in your 20s, but my 20s have been like this crazy rollercoaster [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=594.2s)]
*  that have just like, it hasn't stopped. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=598.2s)]
*  And I'm like, holy shit, this is what they meant by the 20s. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=600.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=602.2s)]
*  Psychotic. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=603.2s)]
*  I mean, you're just over being 10. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=604.2s)]
*  Yeah, literally. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=606.2s)]

*  And you feel like you know everything, man. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=608.2s)]
*  When you're 22 and 23, it's so scary. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=609.2s)]
*  Of course. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=611.2s)]

*  You got into, you got into making music. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=614.2s)]
*  Well, I say you were successful making music while you were still in the military, right? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=618.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=623.2s)]

*  Really? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=639.2s)]
*  The very beginning, you know? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=640.2s)]
*  And I started putting videos on Twitter back in like 2017. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=641.2s)]
*  And then I just kept doing it and doing it and doing it. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=646.2s)]
*  Because I was in the Navy. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=648.2s)]
*  I had a lot of shit going on. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=649.2s)]

*  And I started just making music and I started posting them on Twitter. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=654.2s)]
*  And people, I'd get like five or six likes and I didn't care. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=658.2s)]
*  It was nice. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=661.2s)]
*  It was nice to go home. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=662.2s)]
*  It was nice to go home and feel the way I did and write and put music on Twitter. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=664.2s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=667.2s)]
*  It was kind of my validation in the world of I can write a song at least. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=668.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=671.2s)]

*  What were your aspirations about recording? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=691.2s)]
*  None. I didn't even know what it was. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=694.2s)]
*  That's why all my beginning records are shitty. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=695.2s)]
*  They're not shitty, but... [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=698.2s)]
*  See, when I recorded this, I was about to like go inside. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=700.2s)]
*  I was like, whatever, I'll just throw this on the internet. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=704.2s)]
*  It was like the number one... [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=707.2s)]
*  It's just like an iPhone. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=708.2s)]
*  Uh-huh. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=709.2s)]
*  And it was like the number one voted Reddit video in the entire world, I think. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=710.2s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=713.2s)]

*  No. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=732.2s)]
*  I thought I was going to... [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=733.2s)]
*  My old man was in the Navy for 25 years. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=734.2s)]
*  He was a Master Chief. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=735.2s)]
*  My mom was in the Navy. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=736.2s)]

*  Yeah, just that like whatever. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=740.2s)]
*  And I was like, I'm going to be in the Navy till the day I die probably. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=743.2s)]
*  Until I retire at least. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=746.2s)]
*  And that was it. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=748.2s)]
*  That was going to be my life. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=749.2s)]
*  And I was thinking about it yesterday how crazy my reality is now. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=750.2s)]
*  Like coming back to Oklahoma and being around people and people like coming to get me in diners and being like, take a picture of me. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=754.2s)]
*  I'm like, what is going on, man? [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=759.2s)]
*  There's like 700 people hating me online. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=761.2s)]
*  I'm like, bro, I didn't fucking mean to do this. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=763.2s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=765.2s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=767.2s)]
*  Wow. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=768.2s)]
*  I just kept going. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=769.2s)]
*  Kept writing. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=770.2s)]
*  So when you made your music, you just made it for fun? [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=771.2s)]
*  You make it for yourself? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=774.2s)]
*  Did you plan on... [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=776.2s)]
*  No, I just wanted to be a writer. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=778.2s)]
*  I think writing is like the most beautiful thing in the world because I used to read like Steinbeck books and stuff when I was a kid. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=780.2s)]
*  And I just thought it was so crazy that someone could take words and put them on a page and it would make you feel something. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=785.2s)]
*  Not to be deep either. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=793.2s)]
*  I mean that. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=794.2s)]
*  Like you can be reading a book and feel something like visceral and real from a page on a book. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=795.2s)]
*  It's just ink. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=799.2s)]
*  And you're looking at it and I was like, that's crazy. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=800.2s)]
*  So I started writing poems and stuff when I was a kid. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=802.2s)]
*  And those turned into songs because writing poems is lame, right? [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=804.2s)]
*  Not really. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=810.2s)]
*  Now that I'm 27, I know that it's not. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=811.2s)]
*  But when I was a kid, I thought that. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=813.2s)]
*  I was like, what way can you write poems and it's not weird? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=814.2s)]
*  That's why I started playing guitar. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=817.2s)]
*  Yeah, poems are one of those ones people are embarrassed to say they do. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=819.2s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=821.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=822.2s)]
*  And I don't get that nowadays, but I do if you're 16 or 17. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=823.2s)]
*  You know why? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=826.2s)]
*  Because the people that aren't embarrassed when they talk about poetry are annoying. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=827.2s)]
*  Yeah, they are. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=831.2s)]
*  They're annoying. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=832.2s)]
*  Oh man, you should be. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=833.2s)]
*  That's the problem. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=834.2s)]
*  People talking to me about writing, I'm like, man, you suck. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=835.2s)]
*  Please, please don't. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=837.2s)]
*  I don't want to hear it. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=838.2s)]
*  I don't want to hear it, man. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=839.2s)]
*  Some people just want to unload on you. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=840.2s)]
*  Because it's almost embarrassing to like write vulnerable stuff. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=843.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=847.2s)]
*  But it's not at all. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=848.2s)]
*  At the same time, it's like you have one life, you know. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=849.2s)]
*  But it connects with people so much. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=851.2s)]
*  The vulnerable stuff, like it connects with people. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=853.2s)]
*  It resonates with people so much. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=856.2s)]
*  And people act like you should be ashamed of it. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=858.2s)]
*  Well, it's just, people are ashamed of emotions for some strange reason. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=860.2s)]
*  It's strange. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=865.2s)]
*  It's really weird to talk to people about it. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=866.2s)]
*  It's very stupid. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=868.2s)]
*  It's very stupid. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=869.2s)]
*  At the same time, so many people are drawn to them. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=870.2s)]
*  Like I have so many happy songs and people always love my darker ones. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=872.2s)]
*  And I'm like, this isn't my fault. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=875.2s)]
*  You guys all lean towards this. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=877.2s)]
*  It's not. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=878.2s)]
*  I think what stems from is people criticizing people who lose control of their emotions. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=879.2s)]
*  Like people who are too emotional. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=885.2s)]
*  So like it could be any little thing that goes wrong in their life and they break down, start crying and think the world is out to get them. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=887.2s)]
*  Like that is, that's annoying to people. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=893.2s)]
*  I agree. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=896.2s)]
*  And in harder times, that is really looked down on because those are the people that don't carry their own weight. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=897.2s)]
*  Those are the people that get in the way. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=904.2s)]
*  Those are the people that panic and battle. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=906.2s)]
*  Those are the people that can't control their emotions. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=908.2s)]
*  So when we think about someone who's exploring their emotions or expressing their emotions, we like kind of automatically think about the most annoying aspect of expressing your emotions. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=910.2s)]
*  Other people in your childhood who were just crying all the time. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=922.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=925.2s)]
*  Well, there's some people that just like anything that goes wrong in their life, they think the universe is out to get them. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=926.2s)]
*  Like, God damn it. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=932.2s)]
*  Like, have you ever seen Africa? [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=933.2s)]
*  You ever seen like, you know, that are living in third world countries? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=935.2s)]
*  You ever think people that are walking from Guatemala to try to get through to Mexico to get to America? [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=938.2s)]
*  Wake up every morning so happy to breathe here in America. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=943.2s)]
*  I wake up every morning like, holy shit, this could be so much worse. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=946.2s)]
*  Yeah, that's like when this whole border crisis thing is going on. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=949.2s)]
*  And I'm like, listen, if I was living in Honduras and I had no way of making out and I knew that I could walk all the way to America, my cousin was going to do it. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=953.2s)]
*  My brother was going to do it. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=964.2s)]
*  It's going to take us two weeks to walk to America. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=966.2s)]
*  Like, let's fucking go, man. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=968.2s)]
*  Otherwise, we're stuck. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=969.2s)]
*  And you have to think about that being a story in itself. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=970.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=972.2s)]
*  Like for you as that that person who's like, I'm going to go make this trek and make this journey in my life to make it better. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=973.2s)]
*  That's like an odyssey, right? [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=979.2s)]
*  Like you're. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=980.2s)]
*  Well, people do what they have to do in order to make their life better. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=981.2s)]
*  And when there's nothing you have to do because your life's pretty fucking easy, then people find all sorts of stupid shit to complain about. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=984.2s)]
*  To complain about. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=993.2s)]
*  Because people there's like a level of dissatisfaction that most people just contain all day long. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=994.2s)]
*  And a lot of it is like they have a lot of this fact dissatisfaction with their own self. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=998.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1002.2s)]
*  And they don't address that. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1003.2s)]
*  So instead, they find all this dissatisfaction in the world. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1004.2s)]
*  But that whatever that percentage is, whether their life is unbelievably brutal or whether their life is really easy, they still want to spend, you know, 30 what percent fucking complaining about shit. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1007.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1019.2s)]
*  So they find dumb shit to complain about. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1020.2s)]
*  That means nothing. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1021.2s)]
*  This is weird you're bringing this up because I posted on my Instagram. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1022.2s)]
*  I had to bring it up, but I posted on my Instagram last week this thing called the Catastrophe of Success. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1025.2s)]
*  Have you ever read that? [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1030.2s)]
*  No. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1031.2s)]
*  By Tennessee Williams. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1032.2s)]
*  There's this paragraph at the end. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1033.2s)]
*  He talks about how success just made him like. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1034.2s)]
*  You got it. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1036.2s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1037.2s)]
*  I'm so sorry. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1038.2s)]
*  No, don't pause. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1039.2s)]
*  OK. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1040.2s)]
*  No, I want to read it. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1041.2s)]
*  You got to read this. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1042.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1043.2s)]
*  OK. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1044.2s)]
*  You know then that public somebody you are when you have a name. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1045.2s)]
*  Yeah, you can read it. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1047.2s)]
*  OK. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1049.2s)]
*  You know then that the public somebody you are when you have a name is a fiction created [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1050.2s)]
*  with mirrors and that only somebody worth being is the solitary and unseen you that [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1054.2s)]
*  existed from your first breath and which is the sum of your actions and so is constantly [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1059.24s)]
*  in a state of becoming under your own violation. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1064.1000000000001s)]
*  And knowing these things, you can even survive the Catastrophe of Success. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1067.8s)]
*  Wrong paragraph. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1071.2s)]
*  I had one job. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1072.2s)]
*  It's the one above it. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1073.2s)]
*  But it talks about what you were just saying. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1074.2s)]
*  That people get so content in their lives that they make like the only thing worth. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1075.2s)]
*  The only thing worth it in this life is conflict. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1080.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1082.2s)]
*  You have to have that conflict in those stories and those things that make you suffer. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1083.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1086.2s)]
*  To be happy and content, which is just crazy to think about. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1087.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1089.2s)]
*  It says this is an oversimplification. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1090.2s)]
*  One does not escape that easily from the seduction of an effect way of life. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1092.2s)]
*  Is that how to say that? [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1096.2s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1097.2s)]
*  A feat. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1098.2s)]
*  How do you say that, Jeremy? [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1099.2s)]
*  You got a feat. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1100.2s)]
*  Killed it. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1101.2s)]
*  One of them. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1102.2s)]
*  I got one of them. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1103.2s)]
*  I've never seen that word until I saw this. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1104.2s)]
*  You cannot arbitrarily say to yourself, I will not continue my life as it was before [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1109.2s)]
*  this thing. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1113.48s)]
*  Success happened to me. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1114.48s)]
*  But once you fully apprehend the vacuity of a life without struggle, you are equipped [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1116.2s)]
*  with the basic means of salvation. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1120.76s)]
*  Once you know this is true, that the heart of man, his body and brain are forged in a [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1123.3600000000001s)]
*  white hot furnace for the purpose of conflict, the struggle of creation, and that with the [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1127.72s)]
*  conflict removed, the man is a sword cutting daisies. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1132.88s)]
*  Sick. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1136.64s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1137.64s)]
*  That's sick. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1138.64s)]
*  That not privation but luxury is the wolf at the door and that the fangs of this wolf [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1139.64s)]

*  Why, then with this knowledge, you are at least in a position of knowing where danger [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1150.48s)]
*  lies. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1156.44s)]
*  And people who are content, that's what it means. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1157.44s)]
*  You won't be happy without the conflict of... [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1160.92s)]
*  You need struggle. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1163.1200000000001s)]
*  And that's very unfortunate. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1164.1200000000001s)]
*  That's what I've dealt with a lot lately in my life and like the touring life and things [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1165.5600000000002s)]
*  like that. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1169.8s)]
*  Being successful in anything, it's just hard I think. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1171.5600000000002s)]
*  Which that's so... [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1173.92s)]
*  I'm not trying to... [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1174.92s)]
*  No it is. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1175.92s)]
*  But I'm not trying to bullshit anyone and yeah of course. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1176.92s)]
*  It's not like you're coal miner. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1177.92s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1178.92s)]
*  I'm not being like... [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1179.92s)]
*  In the 1800s. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1180.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1181.92s)]
*  And you're 12. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1182.92s)]
*  It's fucking complicated. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1183.92s)]
*  It's complicated is better to say than hard. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1184.92s)]
*  It's also super bizarre because there's not a lot of people you can talk to about it. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1187.4s)]
*  Of course. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1190.76s)]
*  Yeah, there's no one who relates. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1191.76s)]
*  It's hard. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1192.76s)]
*  I tried to talk to a bunch of different people about it early on and everybody has a different [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1193.76s)]
*  take on it. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1197.88s)]
*  And it's interesting to see some people as time has gone on, they've dealt with it less [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1198.88s)]
*  and less well. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1203.2800000000002s)]
*  Which is crazy to think about. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1204.2800000000002s)]
*  You would think as you went along the route... [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1206.0s)]
*  You'd get better at it. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1208.0400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1209.0400000000002s)]
*  A lot of things in that... [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1210.0400000000002s)]
*  It's been insane. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1212.0400000000002s)]
*  And that really, every time I feel however I'm stressed out, I'll just read that. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1213.0400000000002s)]
*  I'm like, cool. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1216.88s)]
*  Everything will be alright. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1217.88s)]
*  For me, that's why exercise is a key component of my mental health regimen. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1219.2800000000002s)]
*  It's more mental health than anything. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1225.24s)]
*  Personally, because when I was in the Navy, I was running marathons on the weekends. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1227.8000000000002s)]
*  I loved it so much. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1233.64s)]
*  I've always ran a lot. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1235.44s)]
*  And I've lost that along the way of being a musician. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1237.16s)]
*  And I've noticed a decline in how I feel energy-wise. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1241.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1245.0800000000002s)]
*  I've turned them in. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1246.28s)]
*  And it's freaked me out. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1247.28s)]
*  So every morning when I wake up to play a show, I'll always go on a run now. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1248.28s)]
*  I always try to tell other comics that. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1250.28s)]
*  Because a lot of comics do not like to take care of themselves. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1252.76s)]
*  It's like part of the fun of being a comedian. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1255.1999999999998s)]
*  You're just lazy and crazy and you're doing drugs and you're sleeping late. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1256.8s)]
*  Musician too, yeah. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1259.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it's a part of the thing. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1260.6799999999998s)]
*  But I always tell them, your body is literally the race car that you're maneuvering around [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1262.36s)]
*  life in. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1268.12s)]
*  And if you can give that race car more horsepower, if you make it more robust, it works better. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1269.12s)]
*  It works better with everything. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1275.24s)]
*  It thinks better. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1276.5600000000002s)]
*  It handles emotions better. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1277.76s)]
*  It sleeps better. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1280.4s)]
*  It eats better. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1281.4s)]
*  You'll be smarter. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1282.4s)]
*  And people don't want to believe that because it's easier to not. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1283.4s)]
*  But it's also more fun. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1286.6000000000001s)]
*  But fucking lazy. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1287.6000000000001s)]
*  It's also fun though. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1288.6000000000001s)]
*  To not care. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1291.0s)]
*  To go crazy. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1292.0s)]
*  But then you realize it makes it so much worse. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1293.0s)]
*  That's what happened to me last year. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1294.52s)]
*  Because I wasn't being crazy. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1296.28s)]
*  I wasn't shooting up or anything. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1297.52s)]
*  But we were just drinking so much and we weren't working out. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1299.52s)]
*  And I woke up one morning, I was in New York City and I'm like, man, I feel just bad. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1305.6s)]
*  I shouldn't feel like there's an eight in the morning. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1309.9199999999998s)]
*  I haven't done anything. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1312.1999999999998s)]
*  That's when I started addressing it. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1313.84s)]
*  I called my dad. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1314.84s)]
*  I'm like, man, I gotta do something. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1315.84s)]
*  That's the real problem with booze. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1317.3999999999999s)]
*  That's the real problem with booze. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1319.32s)]
*  Unnoticed, yeah. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1320.7199999999998s)]
*  Booze is so much worse for you than weed or mushrooms or anything else. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1321.7199999999998s)]
*  Booze is the worst. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1325.8s)]
*  Because it removes all of your, am I being an asshole, filter? [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1327.8s)]
*  So you're fucking, wah, wah. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1332.28s)]
*  So people get loud and confident and uninhibited and then you feel terrible the next day. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1334.44s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1341.48s)]
*  It's the worst drug. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1342.48s)]
*  But it's also really fun. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1343.48s)]
*  It's the most fun thing you can do. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1344.48s)]
*  It's pretty fun. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1346.64s)]
*  People give me shit all the time because my sister sobered up a long, long time ago. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1347.64s)]
*  And we always talk about it with each other in a way of balancing our lives and things [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1351.28s)]
*  like that and drinking and all that. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1355.4s)]
*  And every time I talk to her, she's like, why don't you just quit drinking if you feel [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1357.8400000000001s)]
*  bad all the time? [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1362.72s)]
*  Because I'm a musician. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1363.72s)]
*  It's a great time to be at that night at the mothership and stuff. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1365.92s)]
*  You go down and you start drinking with your friends and things. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1368.68s)]
*  It's when it gets out of hand that it's not okay. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1370.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1372.64s)]
*  It's a balancing act for sure. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1373.64s)]
*  Did you see Huberman's podcast? [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1375.28s)]
*  On alcohol? [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1377.44s)]
*  No, I didn't. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1378.44s)]
*  It's terrible. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1379.44s)]
*  I watched it. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1380.44s)]
*  Yeah, no. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1381.44s)]
*  I watched that man. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1382.44s)]
*  I was like, I've never put the getaway. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1383.44s)]
*  Really? [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1385.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1386.0s)]
*  It's scary. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1387.0s)]
*  He was talking about it and I was like, I probably was drinking a beer because it was [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1388.0s)]
*  like 8 p.m. and I'm like, oh shit. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1389.92s)]
*  He was like, no, this is, he did not, don't quote me on this. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1391.92s)]
*  He was like, this is, it kills you. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1394.8400000000001s)]
*  Oh, definitely. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1396.3200000000002s)]
*  Every time you drink. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1397.3200000000002s)]
*  And I was like, man, I got to. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1398.3200000000002s)]
*  It's poison. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1399.3200000000002s)]
*  Because I'd stopped drinking, I thought, man, I thought I was being smart. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1400.3200000000002s)]
*  And like last year we were drinking a lot of whiskey. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1403.3400000000001s)]
*  And I was like, I'm going to stop drinking whiskey. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1405.72s)]
*  I'll stick with the light beers and just the beer. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1407.48s)]
*  I started drinking beer and I felt worse and I was like, shit. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1410.48s)]
*  Well, you're getting a lot of carbohydrates. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1412.28s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1413.76s)]
*  And I didn't realize that. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1414.76s)]
*  I woke up every morning like full. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1415.76s)]
*  And I'm like, what? [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1416.76s)]
*  I just can't eat breakfast. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1417.76s)]
*  And it was just crazy. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1420.64s)]
*  So many calories. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1421.64s)]
*  If you're drinking 12 beers, shit, that's a shit load of calories. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1422.64s)]
*  And I mean, our days are so long. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1425.72s)]
*  Like being a musician, people don't realize how much fucking time you're just waiting [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1427.5600000000002s)]
*  around. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1430.3200000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1431.3200000000002s)]
*  Because you get to the venue early and then you wait around all day to play and then you [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1432.3200000000002s)]
*  play and then afterwards everyone wants to talk. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1435.44s)]
*  So you're like up for like 18 hours and there's beer involved in everything. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1437.48s)]
*  And you don't even mean it to do it. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1441.8400000000001s)]
*  But you're like, man, at the end of the night, you're like, I got to eat something, man. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1443.0400000000002s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1447.16s)]
*  I've seen a lot of guys drink them less and one of them is they go to the tequila stage. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1448.16s)]
*  Like tequila doesn't give you hangovers, man. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1451.3200000000002s)]
*  Tequila is better, right? [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1454.3200000000002s)]
*  Don't they do that? [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1455.3200000000002s)]
*  That's like one of the stages. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1456.3200000000002s)]
*  You even saying tequila makes me want to just gag, man. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1457.3200000000002s)]
*  I can't do it. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1459.3600000000001s)]
*  Even the smell of it freaks me out. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1460.3600000000001s)]
*  That's probably my favorite drink. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1462.24s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1463.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1464.72s)]
*  Wow. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1465.72s)]
*  Now. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1466.72s)]
*  It doesn't fuck me up as much as other ones. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1467.72s)]
*  When I am purposely trying to get fucked up, it's whiskey. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1468.72s)]
*  Of course. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1471.48s)]
*  Yeah, me too. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1472.48s)]
*  That's why I had to stop drinking it. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1473.48s)]
*  But the older I get, the more I realize like, dude, you're not invincible. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1474.48s)]
*  You can't do this. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1476.96s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1478.76s)]
*  Your body starts declining and you're like, I got to do something. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1479.76s)]
*  Do you ever do IV vitamin drips after you drink? [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1481.24s)]
*  I tried them once and it made me feel worse. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1484.4s)]
*  So now I'm scared of them. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1486.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I did it at a festival one time because I was just, I did ACL and I'm not, ACL is [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1487.1200000000001s)]
*  amazing and everything. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1492.28s)]
*  It's awesome. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1493.3600000000001s)]
*  But man, I woke up the next morning and I was like, I can't, man. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1494.3600000000001s)]
*  It was like 530. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1499.32s)]
*  I had like the 530 slot and we had been driving all night. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1500.32s)]
*  I was like, man, I can't do this. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1503.6000000000001s)]
*  And Danny's like, here, do this IV. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1505.44s)]
*  It'll make you feel better. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1506.92s)]
*  And I did it and I went on stage. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1508.4s)]
*  I was like, oh, this is terrible. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1510.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1511.0s)]
*  I had a great time and the show was fine. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1512.0s)]
*  But you felt worse? [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1513.52s)]
*  I did feel worse. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1515.1200000000001s)]
*  It gave me a headache for some reason. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1516.1200000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1517.1200000000001s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1518.1200000000001s)]
*  What, man, hmm. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1519.1200000000001s)]
*  I don't want to throw any companies under the bus, but I wonder like what they put in [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1520.1200000000001s)]
*  it. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1523.8s)]
*  Because there's always those IV companies at like the festivals and things. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1524.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1527.44s)]
*  What you want to get in is glutathione. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1528.44s)]
*  That's a big one. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1529.96s)]
*  It actually helps your liver process alcohol. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1530.96s)]
*  A lot of people take glutathione while they drink to actually help. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1533.52s)]
*  I was literally about to ask, can you do it simultaneously? [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1538.08s)]
*  Yeah, you could. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1540.08s)]
*  You could. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1541.08s)]
*  I think that would be cumbersome. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1542.08s)]
*  But a lot of people take liposomal glutathione. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1545.32s)]
*  It's a way it gets in your bloodstream better. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1548.72s)]
*  You like squirt it under your tongue. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1550.72s)]
*  I've tried that before. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1552.0s)]
*  But generally, you're rehydrating and you're getting like a full panel of vitamins. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1554.6s)]
*  You're getting zinc. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1559.68s)]
*  You're getting vitamin D and B. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1560.68s)]
*  I'm going to take some of those. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1563.2800000000002s)]
*  A lot of high dose vitamin C. It's good for your body for sure. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1564.2800000000002s)]
*  Of course. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1567.3600000000001s)]
*  And when you're recovering from a night of drinking, it's good to give your body the [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1568.3600000000001s)]
*  building blocks to try to get your shit together. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1572.88s)]
*  To speak about it technically. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1577.24s)]
*  My body hit a wall because I was so in the Navy and it was so physical. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1580.7800000000002s)]
*  It was so physical. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1585.3600000000001s)]
*  You had to be in such great physical shape. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1586.3600000000001s)]
*  And then all of a sudden it was like, out. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1588.3200000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1590.1200000000001s)]
*  Do whatever you want. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1591.1200000000001s)]
*  Now it's like you're free. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1592.36s)]
*  And I was like, OK, let's go. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1593.36s)]
*  It was crazy. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1594.6799999999998s)]
*  It was crazy. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1595.6799999999998s)]
*  I waited like eight months. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1596.6799999999998s)]
*  It was just such a crazy story. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1597.6799999999998s)]
*  And then when I finally had freedom, I kind of overdid it. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1598.9599999999998s)]
*  Do you ever think about taking like a trainer with you on the road? [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1601.8799999999999s)]
*  I think we're doing it next year. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1604.6399999999999s)]
*  That's a good move. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1605.6399999999999s)]
*  But there's something in me. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1606.6399999999999s)]
*  It might be my ego or whatever, but there's something in me. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1608.12s)]
*  It's like, no, you can do it yourself. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1611.0s)]
*  Well, you can, but will you? [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1612.56s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1614.28s)]
*  That's what's hard. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1615.28s)]
*  If you haven't so far. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1616.28s)]
*  It's so unexpected. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1617.28s)]
*  Well, I mean, I have. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1618.28s)]
*  But you know what you could do? [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1619.28s)]
*  You could make an agreement with the guys that you work with, like where everyone's [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1620.92s)]
*  going to do a specific amount of working out every day. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1625.68s)]
*  Like you're going to do like X amount of days a week. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1629.0800000000002s)]
*  And you have to do with each workout 20 minutes of cardio, 100 pushups. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1632.2s)]
*  That's cool to build camaraderie. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1637.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1638.6000000000001s)]
*  We've been doing better this year on the road. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1639.6000000000001s)]
*  But if you like have something like that where everybody can complain about it and talk shit [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1641.24s)]
*  about it and have fun with it. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1644.64s)]
*  That's when people do their best, man. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1645.92s)]
*  When there's a market they got to compete with. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1647.0800000000002s)]
*  It's cool. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1648.8400000000001s)]
*  It's like a bonding experience. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1649.9599999999998s)]
*  And it's also, you know, it's a shared experience. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1651.4399999999998s)]
*  It's like you're having a fun time and you're getting stuff done and it'll force you to [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1654.6399999999999s)]
*  do it. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1658.6399999999999s)]
*  Like you hold each other accountable and just do it for a month. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1659.6399999999999s)]
*  Only thing I'm going to do for the next month is play pool. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1662.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, you got to get better. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1664.32s)]
*  Because you get a pool man. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1667.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I play a lot though. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1669.84s)]
*  It's not fair. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1671.28s)]
*  I thought I'm telling you when I say we did too. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1672.28s)]
*  Yeah, a lot like too much. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1675.0s)]
*  People like refer to it when they're talking to me. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1678.56s)]
*  So being out there, it's crazy. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1680.48s)]
*  Well, there's pool that you play in a bar, like on a bar table. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1682.96s)]
*  And then there's tournament pool that you play on a tight pocketed table. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1687.28s)]
*  When I showed up and the guy started telling me the rules, I was like, I'm sorry. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1690.1599999999999s)]
*  What? [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1693.24s)]
*  That's for nine ball. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1694.24s)]
*  Of course. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1695.24s)]
*  But we play eight ball. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1696.24s)]
*  It's the best game in the world besides maybe like poker. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1697.24s)]
*  I love it. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1698.32s)]
*  I love it more than anything because you have to execute. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1699.32s)]
*  It's one of the rare games where it's not just knowing what to do and figuring out little [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1701.52s)]
*  puzzles. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1705.2s)]
*  But you have to execute. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1706.2s)]
*  You have to control your body. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1707.44s)]
*  You just put words to how I feel about it too. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1709.4s)]
*  I've always thought that way. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1711.6000000000001s)]
*  I'm like, how is this game so damn fun? [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1712.6000000000001s)]
*  I think that's the same thing that people get with golf. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1714.56s)]
*  You know, because you have to execute. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1716.72s)]
*  You have to make the shot. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1718.52s)]
*  Golf, man. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1720.0s)]
*  You play golf? [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1721.0s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1722.0s)]
*  But Jamie's an addict. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1723.0s)]
*  I can't do golf. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1724.0s)]
*  Jamie just got back from a tournament. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1725.0s)]
*  I can't do golf. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1726.0s)]
*  Something about it I just can't do. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1727.0s)]
*  You'll get there. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1728.48s)]
*  It's got to be the shorts. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1729.48s)]
*  I'm just kidding. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1730.48s)]
*  I'm just kidding. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1731.48s)]
*  A lot of my friends do play golf and they always try to get me to play. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1733.1200000000001s)]
*  It's a super addictive game. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1735.44s)]
*  That's the only reason why I've never messed with it. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1736.92s)]
*  Really? [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1738.64s)]
*  I don't want to get addicted. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1739.64s)]
*  Tony Hinchcliffe and him and Ron White and a lot of my good friends are full on golf [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1740.64s)]
*  junkies. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1745.88s)]
*  Really? [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1746.88s)]
*  They can't stop playing. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1747.88s)]
*  I've been living in the Northeast and there's a big, I feel like in golf you have to go [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1748.88s)]
*  out and there's a lot of work involved in getting into golf. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1753.92s)]
*  Same with sports like lacrosse and stuff like that. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1757.6000000000001s)]
*  There's just a lot of shit you got to have to play. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1761.0400000000002s)]
*  Oh yeah, golf. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1763.0s)]
*  You got to have, how many fucking clubs do you have? [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1764.0s)]
*  You're supposed to have 14 or so in your bag plus your shoes. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1766.04s)]
*  There's rules about what you got to wear out there. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1769.08s)]
*  I just thought it was annoying carrying a pool cue on the road. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1771.1599999999999s)]
*  Like taking a pool cue. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1775.0s)]
*  60 pound bag. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1776.44s)]
*  I feel like a dork when I do that. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1777.44s)]
*  You're not a dork if you do that because some of my friends do it, but you walk into a bar [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1779.44s)]
*  with a pool stick. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1782.56s)]
*  It's like, and also people are like, they don't want to play you at that point. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1783.76s)]
*  I don't at least. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1788.68s)]
*  If I'm at a bar and a guy brings a pool stick in and like a glove, I'm like, okay. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1789.68s)]
*  But the thing, like I never played pool much in bars. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1792.96s)]
*  That's what you're saying out there. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1796.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1797.28s)]
*  Real pool halls. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1798.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1799.28s)]
*  Does that make a difference? [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1800.28s)]
*  Yeah, way different. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1801.28s)]
*  Maybe that's why I think I'm so damn good. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1802.28s)]
*  Yeah, you play in lemons. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1803.28s)]
*  Yeah, that's crazy. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1804.28s)]
*  But a lot of pool players that are really good go to bars because people do think they're [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1805.28s)]
*  good at pool and they'll go and talk shit. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1809.96s)]
*  Hustle up, man. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1812.5600000000002s)]
*  Someone will try to gamble. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1813.5600000000002s)]
*  The next thing you know, they're walking out of there with 10 grand. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1814.5600000000002s)]
*  I have a bunch of friends that have done that. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1816.6000000000001s)]
*  We do the dumbest shit at bars when it comes to pool because we'll all be drinking beers [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1818.52s)]
*  all night. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1822.08s)]
*  It'll be like midnight and someone's like, I'll bet you on this one. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1823.08s)]
*  And then like the whole bar will get around, you know, and just watch us play. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1826.08s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1829.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1830.28s)]
*  It's psychotic. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1831.28s)]
*  Yeah, gambling. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1832.28s)]
*  It's scary. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1833.28s)]
*  Dude, I was in Vegas with Dana White, Taylor Lewin. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1834.28s)]
*  Who else was gambling? [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1839.36s)]
*  Will Compton. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1840.36s)]
*  Will Compton. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1841.36s)]
*  Who else was gambling? [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1842.36s)]
*  That was me and Shane. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1843.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1844.36s)]
*  And Shane Gillis was with us and Jamie. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1845.36s)]
*  And Dana White was gambling and he was down $600,000 playing blackjack. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1848.72s)]
*  I was like, no, don't do it. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1856.2800000000002s)]
*  Taylor was telling us, so we were backstage with Shane. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1859.52s)]
*  Shane Gillis is doing a show at the Mirage. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1862.0800000000002s)]
*  I came to hang out. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1863.8400000000001s)]
*  We're all having a good time. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1864.8400000000001s)]
*  And then he goes, hey, we're going to go gamble with Dana. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1866.2s)]
*  I'm like, oh my God, do you know how hard he gambles? [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1868.4s)]
*  You going to get, he's like, I'm up all this money. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1870.44s)]
*  Taylor's like, I'm fired up. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1872.44s)]
*  Dana shows me how to bet. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1873.88s)]
*  We get there. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1875.06s)]
*  Taylor's down $120,000 in the first five minutes. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1876.06s)]
*  But can also go the other way. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1880.34s)]
*  That's why people do it. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1881.34s)]
*  Yeah, that's why it's so terrifying. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1882.34s)]
*  It did go the other way. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1883.34s)]
*  He made his money back and he won like $65,000, I think. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1884.94s)]
*  And then he backed out. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1888.02s)]
*  People would just gamble on anything. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1889.02s)]
*  Which is cool. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1890.58s)]
*  I do this thing every year where I go to the casino and I'll put X amount of dollars on [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1891.58s)]
*  red every time, no matter what. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1895.06s)]
*  And I've never lost, which I'll probably lose now that I jinxed it. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1897.22s)]
*  But every year, once a year, I'll go and put money on red. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1900.82s)]
*  Just to say, whatever. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1904.82s)]
*  That's good. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1905.82s)]
*  Once a year. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1906.82s)]
*  I can't go to the casino, man. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1907.82s)]
*  It's scary. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1908.82s)]
*  Man, we were in, it's freaky. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1909.82s)]
*  Like in Arkansas and Oklahoma, Missouri, states like that. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1914.1s)]
*  If you go to the casino, I was at the hotel. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1917.82s)]
*  Even the hotels at casinos are scary. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1921.06s)]
*  I'm going to send you something, Jay. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1922.7s)]
*  A bunch of stains on the couches, man. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1924.3s)]
*  You're like, what is going on? [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1925.62s)]
*  You go downstairs and your buddies are smoking cigarettes. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1926.62s)]
*  With those fucking sticks on the lottery machines or what? [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1930.26s)]
*  The slot machines? [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1933.82s)]
*  Yeah, the slot machines. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1934.82s)]
*  It's like a dungeon. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1936.82s)]
*  And you're like, no offense to anyone who gambles, but it scares the shit out of me. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1937.82s)]
*  It should. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1941.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1942.66s)]
*  It triggers some things in your brain. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1943.66s)]
*  There's certain things, though. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1945.34s)]
*  This is Dana. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1946.34s)]
*  He's on vacation in the Amalfi coast. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1947.66s)]
*  And this fucking dude brings a casino. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1951.42s)]
*  He had a casino come to him. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1954.3799999999999s)]
*  Come on. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1955.86s)]
*  Bro, who's that kid next to him? [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1956.86s)]
*  That's the son. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1957.86s)]
*  So he's got stacks of cash. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1959.4599999999998s)]
*  That's a baller, man. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1962.62s)]
*  Plane? [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1963.62s)]
*  No, it's not. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1964.62s)]
*  That's sickness. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1965.62s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1966.62s)]
*  He brought a goddamn casino to his boat. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1967.62s)]
*  My thing is, man, if you can do it, you should do it if it makes you happy. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1968.62s)]
*  Wow, look at you, all open-minded. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1971.06s)]
*  No way. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1973.3s)]
*  I guess. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1974.78s)]
*  I guess the last year of my life has made me like that. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1976.3799999999999s)]
*  Well, that's a good way to be. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1979.3799999999999s)]
*  No one lets you do what you want to do or me do what I want to do. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1981.34s)]
*  Like, when it comes to socially, like on the ... [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1984.4199999999998s)]
*  Well, what do you want to do? [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1986.6999999999998s)]
*  I just think everything is so micro-analyzed. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1989.54s)]
*  Yes. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1991.54s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1992.54s)]
*  But it's just so many voices. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1993.54s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1994.54s)]
*  Agreed. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1995.54s)]
*  Like we were talking about earlier. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1996.54s)]
*  Like, if you go on social media and you read comments about you, you're reading the opinions [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=1997.54s)]
*  of literally millions of people. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2001.22s)]
*  There is no way they're all going to be positive. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2003.5s)]
*  It's like gambling, man. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2005.46s)]
*  It's either one way or the other. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2006.46s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2007.46s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2008.46s)]
*  The problem with social media, though, is the negatives far outweigh the positives in [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2009.46s)]
*  terms of the way it makes you feel. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2012.22s)]
*  Like, when you see someone get ganged up on in the social media ... I've seen it happen [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2014.06s)]
*  to people where they say something on a podcast that people disagree with. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2018.36s)]
*  It's some culture issue or medical issue and people get really mad at them. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2023.28s)]
*  And then you go to their timeline, you see all these people hating on them. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2027.24s)]
*  I just imagine what that does to your psychology, to your mind when you're reading all ... Like, [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2030.72s)]
*  if you read a hundred things that like, Zach, you're a great guy. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2036.92s)]
*  And then one guy, you fucking fraud, you piece of shit. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2040.52s)]
*  I know who you really are. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2043.12s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2044.12s)]
*  Being from like, individually, it freaks me out. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2045.9599999999998s)]
*  Individually, like from the inside out. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2049.0s)]
*  And also, if you see someone get fucking socially ruined, what freaks me out is like, what would [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2051.08s)]
*  have that person done artistically if that wouldn't have happened? [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2057.72s)]
*  What would have that person done for the good of people? [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2061.12s)]
*  Sometimes. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2064.3599999999997s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2065.3599999999997s)]
*  If they would have been ... Depending on what it was. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2066.3599999999997s)]
*  Either way. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2068.52s)]
*  It's just fucking scary. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2069.52s)]
*  There's a thing that people do. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2070.52s)]
*  What it is, is they're terrified of it happening to them. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2072.4s)]
*  So people know it's a thing that people can gang up on people. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2074.8s)]
*  It's the same reason why people jump people. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2078.2400000000002s)]
*  Why like, ten guys will beat up one dude. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2080.04s)]
*  You're terrified of that ever happening to you. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2082.7200000000003s)]
*  And when it's happening to someone else, you just jump in and gang up on people. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2084.6400000000003s)]
*  So it doesn't happen to you? [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2088.2000000000003s)]
*  It's like a thing that people are doing, or they're so afraid of being ganged up on social [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2089.6200000000003s)]
*  media that they just gang up. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2094.4s)]
*  The most neurotic people are also like, oddly, the most aggressive about attacking people. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2096.32s)]
*  I saw on here two years ago, Sapiens, that book. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2103.16s)]
*  I read it because of this podcast. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2107.4s)]
*  In that book somewhere, it says that people are only supposed to be in groups of 150 people, [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2110.3599999999997s)]
*  like villages. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2114.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2115.6s)]
*  I had this rant in Denver, Colorado, two weeks ago. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2116.6s)]
*  We played Red Rocks. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2118.56s)]
*  Everyone afterwards went out to the pool bar, and we were all just hanging out. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2122.4s)]
*  We were walking home. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2125.6s)]
*  And I grabbed my phone. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2127.92s)]
*  I was fucking, I mean, we drank too much, obviously, because we had played Forest Hills [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2129.2400000000002s)]
*  in New York, and then we went to Red Rocks. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2133.2000000000003s)]
*  And we just were celebrating, because it was a big deal to us, at least. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2136.0s)]
*  And I was walking home with like eight other guys, and I had my phone, and I was like, [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2140.14s)]
*  man, screw this. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2143.84s)]
*  And I just threw it behind me. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2144.84s)]
*  Because it's scary, man. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2145.84s)]
*  There's so many fucking people right in the palm of your hands. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2147.32s)]
*  Well, you know what that's from? [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2151.04s)]
*  That's from how we evolved. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2153.44s)]
*  That's what they think, at least. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2155.56s)]
*  That's what some people think. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2156.56s)]
*  It's Dunbar's number. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2157.56s)]
*  And it's more complicated than 150 people. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2159.2s)]
*  It's like there's tiers of people. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2161.7999999999997s)]
*  There's people like family and very close friends, and then there's a tier above that. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2163.92s)]
*  That's the tiers. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2168.84s)]
*  So there's five people that you're super close with, and then there's 15 people that you're [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2169.84s)]
*  slightly less close to. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2174.52s)]
*  And then it goes all the way out to 1,500 people. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2176.0s)]
*  And imagine the vulnerability it takes to be you or me. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2178.52s)]
*  In your life, a lot of people think they know you at the 150 level, but you don't know any. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2181.44s)]
*  Me personally, I don't know. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2187.1200000000003s)]
*  150 people off the top of my head. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2188.8s)]
*  What is this one, Jamie? [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2191.2000000000003s)]
*  I'm just trying to find one that has the explanations of it on the screen. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2192.2000000000003s)]
*  How many friends can a person have? [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2195.36s)]
*  I think about this more often than I should when it comes to looking at my phone and seeing [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2196.36s)]
*  how many followers I have or the bullshit that comes with being socially active. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2200.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2205.2000000000003s)]
*  Well, it's something to think about because what I think is happening is human beings evolved [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2206.2000000000003s)]
*  in these tribal groups, and now we're evolving a new consciousness that is actually global [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2212.24s)]
*  because it went from being in small tribes to larger communities, agricultural communities, [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2219.04s)]
*  cities, millions of people, countries, and now the whole world. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2225.3999999999996s)]
*  And that's a completely new way of interacting with people that has never existed in the [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2230.0s)]
*  ... It's so much heavier than people make it out to be. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2235.68s)]
*  I feel like people are taking it lightly, which obviously a lot of people aren't. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2239.28s)]
*  I don't think they're aware of it. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2242.96s)]
*  I think it's just something that you're kind of dealing with because it's just there. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2244.7200000000003s)]
*  You're tweeting and you're looking at the news and the news cycle is now the news cycle [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2249.1200000000003s)]
*  of literally 8 billion people. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2253.76s)]
*  I haven't talked to anyone like this in four years because I'm so fucking scared, man. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2255.6000000000004s)]
*  Not scared of anything in particular. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2260.2000000000003s)]
*  I'm just not scared of the world either. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2261.7200000000003s)]
*  But you know what I mean? [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2264.44s)]
*  It wasn't worth it to me, not in an arrogant way, just in a way where it was like, man, [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2265.68s)]
*  why? [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2271.0s)]
*  I write enough music. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2272.0s)]
*  You know me from that. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2274.0s)]
*  I just didn't feel the need. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2275.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2276.0s)]
*  Why risk people getting pissed off at you? [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2277.0s)]
*  Yeah, about something silly. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2278.0s)]
*  And I went back to Oklahoma recently. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2280.12s)]
*  I've been in the Northeast for two years, three years. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2281.44s)]
*  And I went back to Oklahoma, man, and I had some time off and I just sat in the grass, [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2285.0s)]
*  sat in a field like I used to when I was a kid. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2289.2400000000002s)]
*  I was like, man, oh, that Duncan Trussell episode with you? [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2291.2000000000003s)]
*  And Duncan Trussell was like, man, there's probably some sad sex sitting by a waterfall [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2295.12s)]
*  with â he didn't know who's mad at him or who he should be scared at. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2299.2s)]
*  You remember that? [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2302.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2303.7599999999998s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2304.7599999999998s)]
*  And he said that. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2305.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm like, he's right, man. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2306.7599999999998s)]
*  Duncan's a genius. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2307.7599999999998s)]
*  He is a genius. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2308.7599999999998s)]
*  And I watch his episodes religiously on here because he's just so beautifully articulated. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2309.7599999999998s)]

*  It's so funny because we did two episodes kind of back to back. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2314.44s)]
*  We did one where we dressed as doctors. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2317.6s)]
*  And what was the other one? [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2319.2799999999997s)]
*  I remember. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2320.2799999999997s)]

*  Oh, we were furries. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2324.48s)]
*  You guys got way too hot. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2325.48s)]
*  Yeah, we were furries. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2326.48s)]
*  Yeah, we couldn't â we were respect to furries because they're putting in work. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2327.48s)]
*  They're putting in work, those furries. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2331.0400000000004s)]
*  I know. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2332.0400000000004s)]
*  You guys are talking about it. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2333.0400000000004s)]
*  I was like, holy shit. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2334.0400000000004s)]
*  I can't believe this realm of people exists. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2335.0400000000004s)]
*  How crazy. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2336.84s)]
*  Somebody had a good idea the other night. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2337.84s)]
*  They're like, you should make every guest dress up. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2338.84s)]
*  No matter how important they think they are, world leaders, make them put on clown costumes. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2341.1600000000003s)]
*  You can do the show, but you have to put on a clown costume. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2347.1600000000003s)]
*  I could barely put on a shirt this morning. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2349.88s)]
*  I was like, what do you wear? [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2351.36s)]
*  What do you do here, man? [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2352.36s)]
*  I've never done this. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2354.72s)]
*  I saw this Johnny Cash shirt sitting in my closet. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2355.72s)]
*  I was like, this is perfect. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2357.72s)]
*  It works. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2358.72s)]
*  This is the perfect shirt for the show. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2359.72s)]
*  It works. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2360.72s)]
*  I thought you were working out in there. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2361.72s)]
*  I was like, okay, shit. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2362.72s)]
*  No. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2363.72s)]
*  Should have did it. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2364.72s)]
*  No. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2365.72s)]
*  I shot bows this morning, got a little workout in, came straight here. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2366.72s)]
*  Where do you shoot bows around here? [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2368.24s)]
*  At your place? [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2369.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2370.52s)]
*  I have a range. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2371.52s)]
*  No, shit. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2372.52s)]
*  I have a range in here, too. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2373.52s)]
*  I can't imagine you just waking up and being like, you know what I'm going to do. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2374.52s)]
*  I'm going to head over and shoot some bows, man. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2376.52s)]
*  It's good for your mind, man. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2378.52s)]
*  It has to be. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2380.52s)]
*  Anything you focus on. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2381.52s)]
*  Forget about bow hunting, but just archery. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2383.04s)]
*  Just archery, shooting at a target is so good for your mind. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2385.64s)]
*  That's why doing anything, writing for comedy probably, writing music, dude, you're just [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2389.16s)]
*  focused. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2394.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2395.32s)]
*  You're in there. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2396.32s)]
*  You're locked in. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2397.32s)]
*  I wish I could just be in that state forever, all the time. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2398.32s)]
*  But you don't, man. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2399.32s)]
*  You've got to love it like you love sex. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2400.32s)]
*  You don't want to fuck all day every day. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2403.2s)]
*  You'd get bored. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2405.04s)]
*  True. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2406.04s)]
*  I'm there. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2407.04s)]
*  I'm not there now. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2408.04s)]
*  I love making music and stuff, but even touring, playing the same songs, I love doing it because [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2409.04s)]
*  the people are so beautiful and the people who come to the shows are so moved by it. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2412.2s)]
*  People look at me and they don't realize that I played the same show X amount of times and [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2417.3999999999996s)]
*  I'm so blessed, so lucky. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2422.3999999999996s)]
*  But sometimes, man, I'm halfway through my set and I'm like, give it all you got, man. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2423.96s)]
*  Give it all you got, no matter how many times you sang it. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2427.96s)]
*  Yeah, you just kind of reset. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2431.24s)]
*  Those people are seeing you in many ... You know what I call the Joe DiMaggio principle [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2433.2799999999997s)]
*  is that Joe DiMaggio was playing once and I think he was like 40 years old and he slipped [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2438.68s)]
*  into third base and the third baseman said, why do you play so hard? [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2442.2s)]
*  You're already Joe DiMaggio. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2447.7599999999998s)]
*  True. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2448.7599999999998s)]
*  And he goes, because somewhere out there in the audience is someone who hasn't seen Joe [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2449.7599999999998s)]
*  DiMaggio play and I don't want to let him down. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2453.8799999999997s)]
*  My dad says that to me every time I go on stage and I think about it too. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2456.44s)]
*  I think what I do when I go on stage, I look out at the audience and I pick out one kid, [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2460.04s)]
*  whether whoever it is, I pick out one kid who's in it and I'm like, man, this one's [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2465.48s)]
*  for you. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2469.24s)]
*  That's how I do it. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2470.24s)]
*  It's kind of a paradox, man, because you write the music or you write a skit and you care [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2471.3199999999997s)]
*  about it so much and then every time you play it, it feels like you're almost giving a little [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2475.56s)]
*  bit of it to other people. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2479.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2481.24s)]
*  At one point you're singing the song and it's so sad because you love the song so much but [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2482.24s)]
*  you've sang it so many times. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2486.8799999999997s)]
*  So when I look at the kid, whoever's out there, I'm like, that's it. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2488.6s)]
*  That's why I'm doing this, man. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2491.12s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2492.12s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2493.12s)]
*  Because it means so much. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2494.12s)]
*  What does it feel like when they sing along? [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2495.12s)]
*  Is that wild when they know the lyrics? [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2496.72s)]
*  This year has been weird because last year was such a crazy year for us growth-wise. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2499.0s)]
*  People used to love it. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2504.48s)]
*  Now I'm getting no arrogance attached. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2505.48s)]
*  I'm just getting big enough to where people are like, man, I go to his shows, can't even [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2508.12s)]
*  fucking hear him sing because everyone's singing along. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2512.64s)]
*  It scares me a little bit because I fear that what if there's some 50-year-old woman [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2516.8s)]
*  or 50-year-old man who's sitting in his house and he's like, I'd really like to go to a [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2522.48s)]
*  Zach Bryan show to hear him sing these songs. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2525.6s)]
*  Then you go to one of the shows and it's all these fucking reckless kids just doing it, [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2528.52s)]
*  man, shirtless, and the 50-year-old sitting back there like, damn it, I just want to hear [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2532.7999999999997s)]
*  him sing it. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2536.44s)]
*  Yeah, but they should be just taking in that experience. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2537.44s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2540.4s)]
*  You're not going to change it. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2541.4s)]
*  No way. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2542.4s)]
*  You're not going to get everybody to stop singing. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2543.4s)]
*  How do you do that? [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2544.4s)]
*  Hey, stop singing. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2545.4s)]
*  That guy sucks. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2546.4s)]

*  That guy sucks, man. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2548.4s)]
*  Whoever that guy is sucks ass, man. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2549.4s)]
*  I hate that guy. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2551.0s)]
*  That guy stormed the Capitol. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2552.0s)]
*  Yeah, of course, man. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2553.0s)]
*  Of course. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2554.0s)]
*  Of course. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2555.4s)]
*  It's so sick, man, because we had Charles Wesley Godwin on the road with us the first [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2556.4s)]
*  year and the second year. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2560.8s)]
*  It felt like when I was watching him open for us or whatever, I'm not even trying to [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2563.64s)]
*  plug him, but when he would be singing and you'd be in these weird fucking 2,000 cap, [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2566.88s)]
*  3,000 cap roller rinks and all these American venues. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2572.56s)]

*  is so beautiful and you're hearing your opener singing, you're like, this is a chapter in [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2585.96s)]
*  something. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2590.7599999999998s)]
*  This has got to be something. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2591.7599999999998s)]
*  This is beautiful. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2594.12s)]

*  I think they play a lot in America too, but it was just dumb luck that we happened to [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2619.88s)]
*  be there. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2624.64s)]
*  I ran into Axl Rose at a restaurant and Axl invited me to the show. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2625.64s)]
*  I'm like, oh shit, this is wild. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2630.04s)]
*  We went and watched Guns N' Roses. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2632.48s)]
*  These dudes are 60 years old. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2634.88s)]
*  And just killing it. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2636.2799999999997s)]
*  Murdering it for three hours. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2637.48s)]
*  I don't get it. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2639.1200000000003s)]
*  For three hours. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2640.1200000000003s)]
*  I love that, man. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2641.1200000000003s)]
*  Do your thing. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2642.1200000000003s)]
*  It was intense. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2643.1200000000003s)]
*  And it was like 95 degrees out. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2644.1200000000003s)]
*  We were talking about earlier how hard the road is and stuff. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2646.5600000000004s)]
*  And I see these older guys doing it. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2648.5600000000004s)]
*  I'm like, man, what's going on? [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2649.76s)]
*  Well, Mick Jagger, when the Rolling Stones were here, they played CODA, the Circuits [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2651.1600000000003s)]
*  of the Americas. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2654.84s)]
*  My friend owns it. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2656.84s)]
*  And he was explaining to me how they brought two trailers, two trailers that are just Mick [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2658.1600000000003s)]
*  Jagger's workout equipment. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2663.4s)]
*  Two trailers full of shit. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2666.36s)]
*  Still moving, man. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2667.84s)]
*  I mean, every day that guy works out. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2668.84s)]
*  Every day. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2670.8s)]
*  Has to. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2671.8s)]
*  Like we were saying, it'll kill you if you don't. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2672.8s)]
*  He's Biden's age. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2673.8s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2674.8s)]
*  Bro. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2675.8s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2676.8s)]
*  He's Biden's age. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2677.8s)]
*  I want to talk. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2678.8s)]
*  Look at him out there. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2679.8s)]
*  And doing what I do at 27, I look at this and I'm like, he looks great. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2684.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2691.0800000000004s)]
*  And dude, he's moving around. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2692.0800000000004s)]
*  You know, like he's not stationary. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2694.04s)]
*  He's not just standing there singing the songs. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2696.84s)]
*  He's dancing. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2698.12s)]
*  As a young person, man. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2699.12s)]
*  Look at him go. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2700.12s)]
*  As a young person, that's not easy. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2701.12s)]
*  No, man. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2704.12s)]
*  These guys, because they're devoted, man. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2705.12s)]
*  They're so into it. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2706.12s)]
*  And the show was epic, right? [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2708.7599999999998s)]
*  So it's at this outdoor racetrack and they have these giant fucking screens, this huge [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2710.64s)]
*  stage and you're seeing Keith Richards and Mick Jagger right there. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2716.12s)]
*  Come on, man. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2720.64s)]
*  Right there. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2721.64s)]
*  Dude, I'm telling you, it was like being on drugs. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2722.64s)]
*  It was like a psychedelic experience. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2724.88s)]
*  I couldn't believe they were really there. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2725.88s)]
*  Those guys are so iconic sometimes. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2727.6s)]
*  I wonder if they ever think about it. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2729.04s)]
*  Like do they ask themselves the same questions that I ask myself or not. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2730.88s)]
*  That sounded shitty, but like since I'm smaller, obviously, like watching those guys, I wonder [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2734.92s)]
*  if they came up and accidentally became legends or like they were so young when they hit the [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2739.84s)]
*  scene. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2747.28s)]
*  You have to stop and think about the 1960s. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2748.28s)]
*  Was their dream to become massive musicians? [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2749.92s)]
*  No, no. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2751.72s)]
*  Nobody could have imagined they could have been the Rolling Stones. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2752.72s)]
*  There's no way anyone can imagine being the Rolling Stones. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2754.8799999999997s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2757.6s)]
*  Do you think Taylor Swift imagined she'd be Taylor Swift? [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2758.6s)]
*  No way. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2760.48s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2761.48s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2762.48s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2763.48s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2764.48s)]
*  Maybe her. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2765.48s)]
*  But for most bands, the idea is just to try to be successful. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2766.48s)]
*  There's so many talented people too. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2769.8799999999997s)]
*  That's what freaks me out being me. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2772.12s)]
*  I know like three chords on the guitar and I'm like, what's up? [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2773.2799999999997s)]
*  And there's so many people that like I get in these circles of these astounding musicians [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2776.52s)]
*  who aren't nearly as big and I almost have like that. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2780.2799999999997s)]
*  I have a real guilt. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2783.8799999999997s)]
*  You know, I'm like, what the fuck am I doing? [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2784.8799999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2787.68s)]
*  Why the fuck am I on stage, man? [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2788.68s)]
*  You're incredible. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2789.7999999999997s)]
*  You're on stage for your songwriting and your voice and your songs, man, and your music [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2790.7999999999997s)]
*  too. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2795.8399999999997s)]
*  But it's like the combination of the things and it's, you know, to toot your horn, man, [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2796.8399999999997s)]
*  it's uniquely authentic. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2801.3599999999997s)]
*  It's just very, you have very authentic music. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2803.24s)]
*  You can kind of tell when someone's bullshitting. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2806.0s)]
*  For whatever reason, it feels like you could take like a certain amount of it. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2809.28s)]
*  Like there's a certain amount of sugar that you can take in food before it starts getting [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2813.32s)]
*  gross. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2816.96s)]
*  You know, you're like, oh, this is so sweet. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2817.96s)]
*  That's why the writing is so important. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2819.52s)]
*  Like it's man, I can't do it. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2820.84s)]
*  The writing is excellent. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2822.8s)]
*  I can't listen to. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2824.2s)]
*  Corny writing. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2827.8s)]
*  Personally, I can't. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2828.8s)]
*  Well, there's no corny comedy. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2829.8s)]
*  And you got to like love it to love it. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2830.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2832.8799999999997s)]
*  Like people in the car with me like, what the fuck are we listening to? [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2833.8799999999997s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, it's an indie song I found. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2836.08s)]
*  I'm like the pretentious asshole. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2838.08s)]
*  You know, you're that guy. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2839.48s)]
*  No, I'm not. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2840.48s)]
*  No way. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2841.48s)]
*  Like I usually put on like the fucking barnyard shuffle 50 of the top hits when people are [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2842.48s)]
*  with me. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2847.2s)]
*  But when I'm alone, you know what I found, man? [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2848.2s)]
*  I don't know if you've ever heard this song, but my friend Brian Simpson turned me on to [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2850.0s)]
*  this song and this song should have been a fucking gigantic hit. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2854.64s)]
*  I mean, I hear this song. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2863.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm going to say I'm going to I'm going to send it to you, Jamie. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2864.52s)]
*  It's called I'm Alive. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2868.6s)]
*  Hold on a second. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2869.6s)]
*  Let me find it for you. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2870.6s)]

*  I'm Alive by Johnny Thunder. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2876.96s)]
*  Here, I'll share it with you, Jamie. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2878.44s)]
*  Man, I always want to be the guy. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2880.4s)]
*  I heard it. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2881.88s)]
*  You got it, Jamie. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2883.2s)]
*  Listen to this, man. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2884.68s)]
*  So this is a song from 1969, I believe. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2885.68s)]
*  And it was re-released sometimes in the 2000s. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2888.36s)]
*  They probably thought the same thing as you. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2893.0s)]
*  But this is listen to this. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2894.0s)]

*  How the fuck did this guy make it? [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2911.0s)]
*  When did you hear this? [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2912.72s)]
*  My friend Brian just sent it to me. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2913.72s)]
*  He's like, you got to listen to this. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2915.0s)]
*  Dude, you want to be on the highway right now. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2917.0s)]
*  Fuck yeah. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2919.64s)]

*  We got to go run around, man. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2978.52s)]
*  This is on our pre-show playlist at the mothership. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2979.6s)]
*  I'm going to start walking out to that. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2984.0s)]
*  When we're hanging out in the green room, we listen to that. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2985.6s)]
*  Well, there's a huge resurgence in music right now because of TikTok and shit like that. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2988.0s)]
*  Because people are like finding old stuff, which is a beautiful thing. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2993.6s)]
*  Also a scary thing, but I don't even know. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2997.2s)]
*  I don't know anything. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=2999.4s)]
*  It's cool because if one person that was big or whatever used that, it might have a brand [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3002.4s)]
*  new life, which kind of stinks for the Johnny Thunder was his name. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3007.72s)]
*  I think Johnny's dead. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3009.72s)]
*  Which is, isn't that crazy? [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3010.72s)]
*  Like the Van Gogh thing where like he knew he was going to be a famous artist and he [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3012.48s)]
*  like, I don't know if this is Van Gogh or I don't know if it's another one, but there [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3016.4s)]
*  was an artist back in that era of like people who my producer, Eddie, he used to tell me [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3020.16s)]
*  this. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3026.3199999999997s)]
*  He said that one of those guys painted his entire life. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3027.3199999999997s)]
*  He would paint in like coffee shops and stuff and he would tell his buddies or whoever he [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3031.68s)]
*  would say, I know one day these are going to be worth something. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3035.4s)]
*  And then he like lived his life, died. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3039.32s)]
*  And then 200, 300 years later or a hundred years later, whatever, he got famous for. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3041.08s)]
*  And that's like the whole plant a tree and watch it. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3048.6s)]
*  Like if you plant a tree, you'll never see grow. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3051.1600000000003s)]
*  Plant a tree, you never see it big, whatever that shit is. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3053.7200000000003s)]
*  I know what you're saying. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3056.64s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3057.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3058.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3059.64s)]
*  And this Johnny Thunder somehow or another, it slipped by. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3060.64s)]
*  How old was he when he died? [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3061.88s)]
*  His real name was Gil Hamilton. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3065.16s)]
*  Tom Jones covered it. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3067.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3069.0s)]
*  I found a Ghostface Killah song that sampled it. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3070.0s)]
*  Oh nice. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3072.7999999999997s)]
*  But yeah, I was trying to, I'm trying to. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3073.7999999999997s)]
*  What year did this guy? [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3075.64s)]
*  I think it said, well, the cover was 69. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3076.64s)]
*  His version, I'm Alive, 68. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3080.52s)]
*  So Johnny Thunder's version was first, right? [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3084.8799999999997s)]
*  And then the 69 version I've also heard. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3087.48s)]
*  Tommy James and the Shondells. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3090.08s)]
*  Yes. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3091.08s)]
*  It's not as good. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3092.08s)]
*  Right? [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3093.08s)]
*  Obviously. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3094.08s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3095.08s)]
*  I think Tommy James and the Shondells wrote it. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3096.08s)]
*  There's a Don Fardon Fardon. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3097.68s)]
*  But if he wouldn't have sang it like that, man. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3099.6s)]
*  Oh, he sang it so good. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3101.08s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3102.08s)]
*  That's a big, that's a weird conflict in my head too. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3103.08s)]
*  Right? [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3105.2799999999997s)]
*  That's a thing, right? [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3106.2799999999997s)]
*  The covering thing is weird. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3107.2799999999997s)]
*  I don't cover on stage because I'm young. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3108.2799999999997s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3109.2799999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3110.2799999999997s)]
*  I don't act like I'm better than a cover. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3111.2799999999997s)]
*  I just, I don't know. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3112.2799999999997s)]
*  Like if it's what I stand by. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3114.2799999999997s)]
*  Well, it's like do whatever you want to do, man. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3117.08s)]
*  Whatever resonates with you. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3120.6s)]
*  But sometimes people just have a feel for a song and they want to redo it. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3122.16s)]
*  When I knew everything, when I knew everything at like 20 or whatever, I used to hear covers [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3127.08s)]
*  and be like, wait, man, you're ruining the feeling of a song. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3132.24s)]
*  Ryder wrote it and it means the world. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3135.6s)]
*  Don't mess it up. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3137.42s)]
*  Some covers are fucking amazing though. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3138.42s)]
*  I agree. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3139.7599999999998s)]
*  Like Stevie Ray Vaughan's cover of Voodoo Child. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3140.7599999999998s)]
*  Come on. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3143.3599999999997s)]
*  Some of the best songs of like ever were covers. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3144.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, there's some amazing. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3146.3599999999997s)]

*  Dave Matthews. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3153.6s)]
*  Dave Matthews. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3154.6s)]
*  Yeah, you've seen the live one where they're all on stage and just. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3155.6s)]
*  It's nuts. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3157.6800000000003s)]
*  And something, recently in my life I've like started delving into, this is crazy to me [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3158.6800000000003s)]
*  that people don't even, and this isn't an issue. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3162.8s)]
*  I have no problem with this, but people don't even give a shit about who wrote whatever [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3165.84s)]
*  if it sounds great, which is cool in a sense. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3170.48s)]
*  But in my life, even as like a writer or whatever, I just now started going to the song credits [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3173.44s)]
*  like looking. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3177.8s)]

*  write something that did write it, or someone who sounded so great covering a song that [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3181.8599999999997s)]
*  you think they wrote it. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3186.54s)]
*  And then you go to it and there's like eight people writing it and you're like, what? [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3187.54s)]
*  This is crazy, you know? [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3191.3799999999997s)]
*  I just found out that Mae West was a writer, and Mae West got arrested for writing, I think [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3193.02s)]

*  One time my dad came in and visited me and we went up and I was like, I'm a dork when [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3551.94s)]
*  it comes to touristy stuff. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3557.6400000000003s)]
*  I love it. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3558.86s)]
*  I love New York shirts on, our hats. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3559.86s)]
*  And you're up, have you ever been in the Empire State Building? [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3561.94s)]
*  Yes. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3564.34s)]
*  I mean, there's a simulation where it's like, you go in that floor and you see all these [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3565.34s)]
*  like hardened men like building and riveting the fucking beams. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3568.78s)]
*  And man, people were coming from like Iowa and California, wherever the hell. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3574.1800000000003s)]
*  Look at this guy adjusting that bolt. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3579.7000000000003s)]
*  Dude. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3582.1800000000003s)]
*  He's probably making a dollar a day. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3583.1800000000003s)]
*  People don't have this anymore, I don't think. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3584.84s)]
*  They don't have the thing where you're like struggling away and your family is whatever. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3586.86s)]
*  What kind of person that could do that? [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3590.7000000000003s)]
*  This is like an athlete. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3592.34s)]
*  We talked about, there was a guy recently we talked about on the podcast that to this [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3594.34s)]
*  day fixes shit like that. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3597.54s)]
*  I don't know what country he was in. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3599.78s)]
*  I don't know if it was America or somewhere else, but this dude was climbing these fucking [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3600.98s)]
*  beams, these metal beams like an athlete. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3604.7400000000002s)]
*  I was watching him do it. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3607.86s)]
*  I'm like, I can't do that. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3608.86s)]
*  So not only is he skilled, but he's carrying tools and he could physically do things that [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3610.02s)]
*  I can't do. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3614.94s)]
*  I'm watching him climb. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3615.94s)]
*  Watch this guy. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3616.94s)]
*  This is a different guy. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3617.94s)]
*  Okay. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3618.94s)]
*  Well, this is another guy that's doing the same kind of thing. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3619.94s)]
*  He's got a harness on. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3621.6200000000003s)]
*  The other guy didn't have a harness. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3622.62s)]
*  There's no way like regulations would let somebody do that in America. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3624.2999999999997s)]
*  It's probably somewhere else. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3626.62s)]
*  That is fucking wild. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3628.1s)]
*  You ever seen like linemen? [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3631.2999999999997s)]
*  Oh, now he doesn't have a helmet. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3632.2999999999997s)]
*  People who work on lines and stuff like the power lines and stuff. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3634.8199999999997s)]
*  My uncles did that growing up. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3637.1s)]
*  That's why I wear dog Martens because my grandfather wore them and he would put his spikes on. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3638.58s)]
*  And my cousins and shit just climb poles like in 20 seconds. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3643.7s)]
*  They go up there and they're just like touching shit that can kill them all day. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3647.2999999999997s)]

*  It's nuts. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3654.06s)]
*  You ever I was watching this, I don't know, it was a balloon or something that flew into [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3655.06s)]
*  these power lines and holy shit. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3661.42s)]
*  They exploded. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3664.66s)]
*  They exploded just as gigantic. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3665.66s)]
*  I think it was mylar balloons or something like that. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3667.8199999999997s)]
*  They flew into these power lines. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3671.14s)]
*  Is that what it is? [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3672.3799999999997s)]
*  These are other balloons that are cops. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3676.8599999999997s)]
*  This guy has to imagine just thinking you have to touch that thing, even knowing that [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3678.06s)]
*  it's not going to get you, understanding how electricity works. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3682.1s)]
*  Just imagine wanting to be in contact with that amount of electricity. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3685.02s)]
*  Dude, you ever seen that guy who does it like in Montana? [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3687.38s)]

*  Oh, no, not for lightning, but he's fixing the... [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3697.46s)]
*  People don't think about where the power comes, like all the power and this dude just... [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3698.7799999999997s)]

*  Bro! [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3780.46s)]
*  It was last seen knocking on window outside. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3781.46s)]
*  I wonder why he was knocking. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3784.46s)]
*  Because he wanted to get in. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3785.46s)]
*  Of course. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=3786.46s)]

*  If it wasn't on women, it was on climbing. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4618.38s)]
*  Fred was lively and addictive. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4620.38s)]
*  There's some sort of magnetism there. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4623.06s)]
*  Right now, I don't know what I'm doing except tomorrow. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4626.06s)]
*  I have no idea. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4629.06s)]
*  As kids, we were together all the time. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4631.06s)]
*  Our relationship deteriorated because he continued to climb and I did not climb anymore. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4635.18s)]
*  Fred was only focused on climbing and he never felt sorry for you if your climbing [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4644.06s)]
*  ended up in a divorce. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4650.42s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4652.42s)]
*  Totally obsessive. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4653.42s)]
*  That's who Fred is. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4654.42s)]
*  Dude, he's just sleeping on the ground. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4655.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4657.42s)]
*  Everywhere. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4658.42s)]
*  Some people may think it's an adventure to go on a cruise ship to the Mediterranean. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4659.42s)]
*  To me, it's no adventure at all. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4662.42s)]
*  Somebody bombs the ship. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4665.42s)]
*  Contemporaries, they founded companies. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4667.42s)]
*  They were like movie stars for a while. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4669.42s)]
*  That was, to me, has been one of the great mysteries. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4671.42s)]
*  I wonder how many people are like this. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4672.78s)]
*  Why did the best climber of all never go on to the greatness that they all did? [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4673.78s)]
*  He's a dirtbag and because of that, I don't think he'll get the recognition that he really [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4678.78s)]
*  deserves. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4683.78s)]
*  It's a really good documentary. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4684.78s)]
*  That's insane. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4687.78s)]
*  I can't recommend it enough. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4688.78s)]
*  It's fascinating. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4689.78s)]
*  When did it come? [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4690.78s)]
*  It was a few years ago I saw it. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4691.78s)]
*  I don't know what year it came out. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4692.78s)]
*  That's a while. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4693.78s)]
*  Six years ago. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4694.78s)]
*  Six years ago? [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4695.78s)]
*  It's really good. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4696.78s)]
*  He just sleeps on the ground. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4697.78s)]
*  What's weird to think about is... [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4698.78s)]
*  He just never stopped wanting to do that one thing. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4700.139999999999s)]
*  For some reason, that haunts people. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4704.139999999999s)]
*  Is that a bad thing or a good thing, you think? [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4706.139999999999s)]
*  Here's what's weird. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4708.139999999999s)]
*  If you saw him sleeping on the ground like that and he was 20 years old, you'd go, oh, [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4709.58s)]
*  he's a kid. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4713.94s)]
*  He's still living his life. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4714.94s)]
*  Why is it when you see him when he's 70 years old like that is it's so sad? [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4716.74s)]
*  Because we have a thing everyone has to abide by in our lives. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4720.259999999999s)]
*  Which I think is, I don't know, I think it's good for us. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4725.34s)]
*  It's good to have that thing? [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4728.259999999999s)]
*  I think it's good to evolve past... [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4729.74s)]
*  Not if you're that guy. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4732.860000000001s)]
*  I guess. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4733.860000000001s)]
*  That's what I was asking. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4734.860000000001s)]
*  Who knows what's right? [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4735.860000000001s)]
*  I think we have to realize that everyone is not wired the same no matter what we think. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4736.860000000001s)]
*  And everyone thinks everyone should be. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4741.780000000001s)]
*  Everyone thinks that everyone should be wired exactly the way they are. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4744.46s)]
*  And then when they aren't they're pissed. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4748.62s)]
*  Yeah, that's just not the case. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4749.62s)]
*  They want to control. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4751.42s)]
*  Yeah, it doesn't work that way. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4752.42s)]
*  Want to control, yeah. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4753.820000000001s)]
*  That's how I feel with everything sometimes. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4754.820000000001s)]
*  That's why I get so frustrated with people. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4758.14s)]
*  Because everything I do someone has an opinion or whatever and I'm like, this seems like [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4760.02s)]
*  you just want me to be who I'm not when it comes to these sorts of things. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4762.9400000000005s)]
*  That's just, you're probably, if I had to guess, you're probably taking in too many [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4768.06s)]
*  opinions. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4772.42s)]
*  Of course, man. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4773.42s)]
*  You should probably have as little opinions coming in as possible. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4774.42s)]
*  I think you know what you're doing. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4777.22s)]
*  Deal. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4778.5s)]
*  Deal. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4779.5s)]
*  Isn't it crazy man? [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4780.5s)]
*  It's nuts. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4781.5s)]
*  Just stay away from other people's ideas. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4782.5s)]
*  But also, I feel like people didn't grow up in this. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4783.5s)]
*  I feel like people, this is a whole new world now. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4787.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4789.54s)]
*  When I was talking to Travis, I respect him after talking to him and things like that. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4790.54s)]
*  And we were talking and he was telling me about all these things and I was like, indifferently [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4796.22s)]
*  I was like, man, I feel like we live in two different realms of music and things like [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4802.38s)]
*  that. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4807.02s)]
*  Because I feel like the world's so different now from when the whole Nashville scene was [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4808.02s)]
*  back then. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4812.1s)]
*  It's just funny to get to talk to other people and hear about their experiences and how they, [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4813.66s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4818.3s)]
*  What's the big difference? [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4820.5s)]
*  I feel like radio was a huge thing. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4824.14s)]
*  It might still be, but I feel like radio was a really, really big deal back in the day. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4826.78s)]
*  And it's still a big deal, but it's becoming smaller and smaller and smaller. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4831.46s)]
*  Yeah, nobody really, I mean, I'm sure some people do, but the amount of people that listen [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4834.82s)]
*  to radio now has to be. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4838.9s)]
*  I've been surprised by it lately because I've been going to the lake and stuff. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4841.14s)]
*  I've been going to birthday parties and things and I've heard a lot of radio and I'm like, [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4843.660000000001s)]
*  oh wait, I guess people still listen to the radio. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4846.660000000001s)]
*  Can you make radio sound good? [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4848.860000000001s)]
*  It was always a lower quality signal, right Jamie? [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4851.38s)]
*  They have what they call HD radio now, but it's still using the same technology. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4853.620000000001s)]
*  It's still spreading out radio waves. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4858.42s)]
*  But is it as good sounding as like... [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4860.9400000000005s)]
*  A streaming. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4863.34s)]
*  XM sounds better, right? [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4864.54s)]
*  Yes. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4866.18s)]
*  And then streaming's the best sound. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4867.18s)]
*  Yeah, it's all compression. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4868.18s)]
*  It's going to be the best sound. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4869.18s)]
*  Is it in the air though? [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4870.26s)]
*  Most don't. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4871.26s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of people don't even realize it. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4872.26s)]
*  They just want to hear it loud, turn it up. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4873.62s)]
*  That's crazy about writing music and stuff like that because the first records and stuff [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4875.900000000001s)]
*  that were so bad, we recorded on this kind of microphone and we didn't know what we were [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4881.54s)]
*  doing so everything just kind of sounded shitty. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4886.820000000001s)]
*  But it renewed my faith in humanity because no one gave a shit. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4888.9400000000005s)]
*  They were like, no, these are good songs, man. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4893.18s)]
*  We like them. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4894.5s)]
*  It's authentic. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4895.5s)]
*  Yeah, it was cool. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4896.5s)]
*  I'm dead for things being not that professional. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4897.82s)]
*  It shows you more of who the person is. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4901.18s)]
*  I agree. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4903.9s)]
*  As long as it's legit. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4904.9s)]
*  The worst thing is fake authenticity. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4907.74s)]
*  You say that, but like all the... [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4910.66s)]
*  Oh man, can't. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4915.66s)]
*  Can't. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4917.66s)]
*  Man, I don't think people give a shit, man. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4918.66s)]
*  That much at least. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4922.86s)]
*  The songs on the radio and things like that, they're all... [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4924.78s)]
*  Well there's two different things going on, I think. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4927.98s)]
*  There's people that are making songs that they think are going to be hits and then there's [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4930.179999999999s)]
*  people that are making songs because they want to create something special. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4934.259999999999s)]
*  I think there's two different things that are happening. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4938.099999999999s)]
*  Some people are really good at that one thing where they make hits and they make these kind [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4940.66s)]
*  of catchy songs and maybe they don't resonate with you, but they resonate with enough people [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4945.0599999999995s)]
*  that they become real successful. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4949.3s)]
*  But it's like... [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4951.58s)]
*  It gets to all kinds of different levels. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4954.38s)]
*  It gets to the Milli Vanilli level, right? [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4956.18s)]
*  Where they created a fake band and they had these guys go out and lip sync it. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4959.0599999999995s)]
*  That's insane. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4963.34s)]
*  I feel like that was more acceptable back in the day. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4964.34s)]
*  I feel like people are really hitting on the whole realness thing nowadays. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4966.7s)]
*  When back in the day, I feel like there were just megastars who just did whatever. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4970.62s)]
*  All the lip syncing and things, all the conspiracies. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4975.46s)]
*  Do people still do that today? [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4977.18s)]
*  Some people do, right? [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4978.74s)]
*  I think? [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4980.1s)]
*  I don't really know. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4981.1s)]
*  I've seen... [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4982.1s)]
*  Didn't Cardi B throw a microphone? [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4983.1s)]
*  She got very angry. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4984.860000000001s)]
*  She threw two microphones, though. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4985.860000000001s)]
*  I saw. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4986.860000000001s)]
*  Was the music still playing? [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4987.860000000001s)]
*  Was someone playing a drink in there? [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4988.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah, she was rapping, if you will, over her track without the vocals taken out, which [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4989.860000000001s)]
*  they do sometimes. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4993.860000000001s)]
*  It's very gray. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4995.1s)]
*  It's like a gray area for me, but it doesn't make sense to me because when I play... [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=4996.1s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5001.02s)]
*  Is that why the girl threw the drink in there? [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5002.02s)]
*  No, but they also... [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5003.780000000001s)]
*  Getting way too deep. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5006.42s)]
*  Some contracts, they might not pay for you to do the real performance. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5007.46s)]
*  They might just pay for that and you have a different fee for that performance kind [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5010.58s)]
*  of thing because it's still less... [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5013.9400000000005s)]
*  Risky? [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5015.54s)]
*  ...less of a big thing for them. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5016.54s)]
*  Yeah, less risky. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5018.26s)]
*  They're not... [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5019.5s)]
*  It was like daytime in Vegas. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5020.5s)]
*  Do people get mad when you do that? [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5021.5s)]
*  In Vegas, in the daytime party, why would you... [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5024.38s)]
*  You're not... [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5026.1s)]
*  You're just happy that they're there. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5027.1s)]
*  Do you remember when there was a girl who got caught doing that on Saturday Night Live? [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5028.1s)]
*  That's what I was talking about when I brought it up. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5031.38s)]
*  The whole conspiracies behind lip syncing and stuff. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5032.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5035.78s)]
*  Today, production is so fucking in everything that people will just say they're like, it's [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5036.86s)]
*  a backtrack when in reality it's a lot of their performance. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5043.34s)]
*  There's a word for it now so it's okay. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5046.46s)]
*  I think, man. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5049.3s)]
*  I've never dove into it or anything, but it kind of sucks when I got my boys up there [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5050.3s)]
*  busting their ass, fucking trying to hit every single note, right? [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5055.78s)]
*  Right. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5058.5s)]
*  Which is a lot of beautiful bands who still do that to this day, but you hear about a [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5059.5s)]
*  lot of click tracks and shit and you're in ears. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5063.179999999999s)]
*  It's like, oh man, we rehearsed a lot to make this sound almost as good as that. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5065.46s)]
*  It's a playback track or whatever. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5072.14s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5073.82s)]
*  That's a weird controversy, I guess, with people, right? [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5075.38s)]
*  And I forget words all the time, which is crazy. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5077.9800000000005s)]
*  I was at a festival two weeks ago and I was playing in front of fucking 25, 30,000 people [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5080.9s)]
*  and I was playing and I literally blanked on it and I had nothing. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5085.9s)]
*  I got nothing. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5089.14s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5090.14s)]
*  And I'm like... [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5091.14s)]
*  What'd you do? [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5092.14s)]
*  I just said, hey, I'm going to restart it. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5093.14s)]
*  I forgot the words. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5094.14s)]
*  And people were like, yeah, I mean, it makes sense to me, but it's such fucking... [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5095.22s)]
*  It blows people's minds. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5098.38s)]
*  I'm like, no, I'm singing this stuff. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5099.38s)]
*  Well, it's also cool for the people too because they get to see something that's rare. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5101.1s)]
*  It's not just a regular performance. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5104.58s)]
*  Which is silly. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5106.700000000001s)]
*  People are so inhuman to me when it comes to watching people perform. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5107.700000000001s)]
*  I'm like, how the fuck... [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5110.22s)]
*  How are they doing it? [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5111.860000000001s)]
*  Because when I'm performing, I'm going crazy in my head. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5114.02s)]
*  I'm like, don't forget it. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5117.02s)]
*  Don't forget it. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5118.02s)]
*  You got it. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5119.02s)]
*  You got it. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5120.02s)]
*  Look at the kid. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5121.02s)]
*  Have you ever taken anything from memory, like nootropics or anything like that? [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5122.02s)]
*  You know what those are? [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5125.860000000001s)]
*  Budweiser every time. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5126.860000000001s)]
*  Budweiser will do a different thing. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5127.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5129.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5130.34s)]
*  I don't know if Budweiser is bad for your memory, but I don't think it's good. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5131.34s)]
*  It can't be. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5133.54s)]
*  The other guy said, Huberman said it kills you. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5134.54s)]
*  Yeah, it's relaxing you. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5136.14s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5138.42s)]
*  But there's a bunch of different things that are called nootropics, and they're vitamins, [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5139.5s)]
*  nutrients that you can take that actually help your memory, they help brain function. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5145.02s)]
*  My buddy Austin, he takes them all the time. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5149.3s)]
*  He makes it a huge deal when he does too. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5151.06s)]
*  He makes a big deal out of it. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5152.860000000001s)]
*  He jokes about it. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5153.860000000001s)]
*  He jokes about it, man. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5155.66s)]
*  He'll take one and be like, hey guys, I'm on on it right now. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5157.62s)]
*  I can do anything you want. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5160.5s)]
*  It's crazy, man. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5162.66s)]
*  But I've never felt like I needed to. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5163.9s)]
*  I feel like I've done a pretty good job of remembering every word I've ever written when [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5165.58s)]
*  it comes to being on stage. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5170.299999999999s)]
*  But not even just for that. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5171.759999999999s)]
*  It increases whatever the fuck is going on in your head when you're conscious. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5173.179999999999s)]

*  You vary in how well you can talk. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5186.54s)]

*  You vary in how much energy you have. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5190.82s)]
*  What nootropics do for me is they can get you to a point where there's less of the negative [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5194.179999999999s)]
*  and much more of the communicating and being able to think and being able to remember things [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5202.44s)]
*  at the peak of your abilities. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5210.179999999999s)]
*  You want to be closest to that. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5212.2s)]
*  We joked about taking one before I came on here. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5213.919999999999s)]
*  Did you? [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5215.919999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5216.919999999999s)]

*  I take like six at a time, those alpha brains. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5218.919999999999s)]
*  Everyone likes being quick-witted when it comes to just speaking and communicating and [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5222.839999999999s)]
*  things like that. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5225.759999999999s)]

*  At the beginning of the year, when you saw us in Austin, two-step in, started our Europe [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5247.98s)]
*  run into the May run, which was like 60 days. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5253.679999999999s)]
*  It was absolutely insane. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5259.48s)]
*  At the end of it, we ended at Railbird in Kentucky. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5260.56s)]
*  I just laid in the grass and I was like, thank God. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5263.240000000001s)]

*  I don't think Mick drinks anymore. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5273.88s)]
*  That checks. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5276.200000000001s)]
*  I've been there too. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5277.200000000001s)]
*  I'm trying to guess. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5278.200000000001s)]
*  It's been a weird conflict in my head because I don't take anything. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5279.200000000001s)]
*  I don't take pills or anything. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5284.120000000001s)]
*  Getting on stage is scary. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5286.6s)]
*  I mean normal pills like beta blockers. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5287.8s)]
*  They keep you from freaking out. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5290.56s)]
*  Have you ever taken those? [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5292.4400000000005s)]
*  No. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5295.04s)]
*  I've always wondered. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5296.04s)]
*  I've taken them one time and I took them and I was like, this feels weird, man. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5298.0s)]
*  I'm not in it. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5302.24s)]
*  I get really bad stage fright. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5303.96s)]
*  Super bad stage fright. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5306.320000000001s)]
*  But then as soon as I'm on stage, I'm like, this is sick. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5308.4800000000005s)]
*  I don't know where it comes from. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5310.4400000000005s)]
*  So it's right before? [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5311.4400000000005s)]
*  Every time. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5313.0s)]
*  Just before. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5314.0s)]
*  My whole body locks up and I'm like, you can't do this. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5315.0s)]
*  You can't do this. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5316.96s)]
*  Oh shit, we're doing it. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5317.96s)]
*  Oh, okay, cool. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5318.96s)]
*  And then I'm doing it. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5319.96s)]
*  I'm like, why are you freaking out? [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5320.96s)]
*  I think it's just because you love what you do and you want to do it great. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5321.96s)]
*  Yeah, nervousness is a good thing. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5325.16s)]
*  I think there's a certain amount of nervousness is a good thing. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5326.92s)]
*  And I'm grateful for it. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5330.32s)]
*  Yeah, it puts you on edge. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5331.6s)]
*  Truly. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5332.6s)]
*  It's nice. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5333.6s)]
*  Because your performance is like, when I saw you live, you're so hyped up, man. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5334.6s)]
*  So it was really exciting. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5337.8s)]
*  It was really fun. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5339.28s)]
*  And if you have to be nervous before every show to accomplish that. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5340.52s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5343.6s)]
*  I'm hungry, man. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5345.200000000001s)]
*  I don't miss it because I still am. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5346.200000000001s)]
*  But I just always want to feel that. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5347.56s)]
*  I always want to feel like I'm proving something every single time. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5348.8s)]
*  You can keep that. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5352.04s)]
*  I know. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5353.04s)]
*  I know. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5354.04s)]
*  And it's been beautiful to see that over the last three years because I thought at this [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5355.04s)]
*  point I'd be like, oh, screw it, man. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5356.280000000001s)]
*  It's beautiful. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5358.56s)]
*  It's cool. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5359.56s)]
*  I think if you love what you do, you can keep it. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5360.56s)]
*  I think there's just, as you're going to get more and more successful, it's going to get [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5361.92s)]
*  more complicated. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5365.84s)]
*  Your life will get more complicated. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5366.84s)]
*  Gets more intertwined and it gets more public. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5368.72s)]
*  And you're going to experience a lot of success. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5371.8s)]
*  And when you experience a lot of success, then it becomes weird. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5376.88s)]
*  And then you have to readjust constantly to this new way of life. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5381.400000000001s)]
*  Readjust this new amount of pressure that people have on you. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5386.08s)]
*  To adapt. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5390.04s)]
*  To adapt. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5391.04s)]
*  It's crazy to think, man, I remember when it all first started, I was like, oh, this [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5392.2s)]
*  is it. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5395.96s)]
*  I did it. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5396.96s)]
*  And it was like two months in. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5397.96s)]
*  I had no idea. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5399.12s)]
*  I got a steak dinner bought for me by a label or something. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5400.6s)]
*  I was like, man, if all I get from this is steak dinner, then I did it. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5402.96s)]
*  And it's been really beautiful to watch it unfold and see how it all worked out. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5406.8s)]
*  That's awesome. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5411.84s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5412.84s)]
*  It's absolutely crazy. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5413.84s)]
*  Yeah, it is a crazy story, right? [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5414.84s)]
*  It is. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5417.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5418.52s)]
*  And being in the Navy for nine years beforehand is even crazy. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5419.52s)]
*  Because no one ever talks about that. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5421.72s)]
*  I'm like, bro, I busted my ass, man. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5423.52s)]
*  I was like in Africa and fucking Bahrain and stuff. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5425.160000000001s)]
*  What'd you do in Africa and Bahrain? [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5429.6s)]
*  I was a... [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5432.12s)]
*  This is a crazy story in itself, but I won't tell the whole thing. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5433.12s)]
*  Tell the whole thing. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5438.16s)]
*  Shit. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5439.16s)]
*  I'm like, open a second Bud Light and let's go. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5440.16s)]
*  Like I said about my dad, he was in the Navy for like 25 years. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5444.04s)]
*  So I was, hey, man. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5447.08s)]
*  Look at you. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5449.12s)]
*  Hey, man. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5450.12s)]
*  Dork, bro. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5451.12s)]
*  I've always loved dress blues, though. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5452.12s)]
*  That is sick. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5455.12s)]
*  You ever heard that song Dress Blues by Isabel? [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5456.12s)]
*  No. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5457.8s)]
*  It's beautiful. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5458.88s)]
*  It's beautiful. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5459.88s)]
*  But my dad was in the Navy for like 25 years. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5460.88s)]
*  And my mom was in the Navy, like I said earlier, my grandpa was in the Navy. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5464.28s)]
*  And so growing up, when I was like 14 years old, I was like, man, I'm going to be in the [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5467.92s)]
*  Navy. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5470.6s)]
*  That's all I want to do. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5471.6s)]
*  I want to like die for this country, man. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5472.6s)]
*  It's the best country in the world. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5473.6s)]
*  I want to be in it. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5474.6s)]
*  I want to experience that whole like Empire State Building thing where you're devoted [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5475.84s)]
*  to something. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5479.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5480.84s)]
*  And so I turned 17 and my dad was a recruiter in Oklahoma. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5481.84s)]
*  And I was like, okay, cool. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5485.360000000001s)]
*  So he like helped me get recruited. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5487.36s)]
*  And I was supposed to go in the Navy as a diver. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5489.28s)]
*  But shit fell through. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5492.28s)]
*  My dad was like, it'll be fine. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5493.839999999999s)]
*  You'll get to boot camp and they'll ask you if you want to be a diver. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5495.0199999999995s)]
*  And then you could just say yes and it'll be fine. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5498.48s)]
*  So I was like, okay, sick. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5500.12s)]
*  I was like, get on a fucking bus. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5501.599999999999s)]
*  And I'm like, let's do this. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5503.24s)]
*  And I was nervous. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5504.24s)]
*  I was scared, man. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5505.24s)]
*  I was terrified because as like a kid, you don't really know what to expect in the military. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5506.24s)]
*  And I like end up at boot camp, which is crazy. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5511.04s)]
*  And I was terrified. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5515.44s)]
*  And then I realized it was all just kind of routine and stuff like that. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5516.88s)]
*  And I got out of boot camp. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5521.16s)]
*  Actually no, that's not the whole story. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5523.56s)]
*  I was trying to be a diver. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5525.2s)]
*  And one day they were like, hey, you're going to get to reclass what you're doing. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5527.56s)]
*  And they gave me like two options. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5534.32s)]
*  And it was like be a master at arms, which is like a cop in the military or be an aviation [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5537.88s)]
*  Which is like the dudes who like load the bombs and things on planes. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5544.76s)]
*  And I was pissed at my dad. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5548.24s)]
*  I was like, what the hell, man? [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5551.12s)]
*  I thought you said I was going to get to be a diver. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5552.4400000000005s)]
*  I called him. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5555.08s)]
*  I'm like, dude, you suck, man. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5556.08s)]
*  And so my buddies were all AOs, which in the Navy, they're all fucking made fun of because [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5558.12s)]
*  they're all like big old dumb idiots. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5561.8s)]
*  And then I became an AO and I went to a school to be an AO and it was amazing, man. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5564.16s)]
*  I met some of those beautiful people I've ever met. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5568.64s)]
*  I've learned more than I've ever learned. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5570.28s)]
*  But while I got stationed in Nebraska and I hate this, I'm not going to oversell this [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5572.6s)]
*  because I don't want to sound tough. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5579.4400000000005s)]
*  But I trained to be a SEAL for like two years with this guy named Senior Chief Lundquist [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5580.76s)]
*  out of Omaha, Nebraska. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5584.88s)]
*  And I trained really, really hard. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5587.4400000000005s)]
*  I took a bunch of these PSTs and I would call my mom like every day. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5589.240000000001s)]
*  She would ask me how far I ran, how far I swam, how much I lifted and shit. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5592.9400000000005s)]
*  And then I don't take it lightly either. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5599.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm not tough. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5602.04s)]
*  It never happened. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5603.04s)]
*  But I wanted to go to Buds really bad because like I said, I wanted to do something that [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5604.04s)]
*  was greater than myself. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5608.44s)]
*  And then the day my package came back for the SEAL, the Buds thing, my mom had died [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5610.6s)]
*  and I was like, oh fuck, man, this sucks. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5616.44s)]
*  This is crazy. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5618.76s)]
*  And all the while I was an AO and I hated it. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5619.76s)]
*  I hated it. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5622.04s)]
*  I was like, oh shit, now I got to be an Ordnanceman. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5623.04s)]
*  And when she passed away, I was like, man, I don't want to do that. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5626.52s)]
*  I don't really want to pursue that. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5630.36s)]
*  So I bitched out for sure. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5632.16s)]
*  And I wish I wouldn't have sometimes, but like life is crazy. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5633.759999999999s)]
*  My chief, my chief who's like high ranking, he looked at me and he was like, man, you [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5636.639999999999s)]
*  want to go out there and die or something? [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5640.759999999999s)]
*  Why do you want to do this so bad? [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5642.92s)]
*  And I was like, I guess you're right. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5644.16s)]
*  And it's one of those stories in my life where I kind of, I look back and I'm like, man, [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5645.96s)]
*  if things would have been different, what would have happened? [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5650.04s)]
*  But she passed away and then I moved to Washington to be an Ordnanceman. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5652.719999999999s)]
*  And then as soon as I fucking landed in Washington, they sent me, they sent me to the desert, [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5656.88s)]
*  this Bahraini desert to like learn how to like build missiles and load missiles. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5662.360000000001s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5665.92s)]
*  And it was sick, man. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5666.92s)]
*  It was beautiful. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5668.6s)]
*  So you had to build missiles as in like load them or as in like disassemble and reassemble? [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5669.6s)]
*  And this is different from EOD. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5676.12s)]
*  There's Explosive Ordnance Disposal and then there's AOs, which AOs are kind of just like [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5678.08s)]
*  the little tiny baby cousin of, not even, they're not even connected. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5682.08s)]
*  In EOD, there's some badass guys. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5686.04s)]
*  AOs are just the dudes who build, load, arm and de-arm the bombs that are on the planes [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5687.32s)]
*  that are taken off. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5692.04s)]
*  Just build bombs. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5694.96s)]
*  No big deal. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5695.96s)]
*  Yeah, it's cool, man. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5696.96s)]

*  And, but fucking, it's crazy. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5698.96s)]
*  So I was in the desert, man. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5701.0s)]
*  I was fucking like 19 years old, like, oh shit, okay, I'm here. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5702.0s)]
*  And I was a sand sailor for sure. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5705.8s)]
*  I never, I never like was on a ship. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5707.76s)]
*  And so that was my first deployment and I fell in love with it. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5712.2s)]
*  I wanted to do it like always. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5714.8s)]
*  I was like, this is amazing. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5716.2s)]
*  I had this really great gunner. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5717.2s)]
*  Gunner's like your officer above you. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5718.96s)]
*  And he just inspired me so much to be the best that I could be like every day. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5721.4400000000005s)]
*  So I'd go into work and be, dude, I was a fucking kiss ass, like in the Navy. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5724.360000000001s)]
*  Everyone hated me. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5728.08s)]
*  So I was like, let's do it. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5729.08s)]
*  Let's go to war, man. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5730.08s)]
*  Let's go. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5731.08s)]
*  And we were just doing simple shit like eating dinner, you know? [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5732.08s)]
*  And but I fell in love with it and I wanted to do it forever. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5734.4400000000005s)]
*  And so we would like launch planes out and like do the keys and shit to arm the missiles [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5738.64s)]
*  that took off and things like that. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5744.4s)]

*  Was there a lot of wildlife? [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5803.36s)]

*  That's all you do. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5814.92s)]
*  And you're as happy as you're happy as fuck because it's so simple. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5815.92s)]

*  That's what it looks like. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5823.24s)]
*  No way. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5824.24s)]

*  It's cool. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5828.28s)]
*  And so you're just on the base and that's it. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5829.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5832.88s)]

*  It never happened. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5868.8s)]
*  I would never do that because I was so devoted to being in the Navy. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5869.8s)]
*  They thought they were losing all power over you. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5872.360000000001s)]

*  And I had this fucking, my gunner one day comes up to me and he's like, hey, man, this [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5877.72s)]
*  is getting crazy. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5883.84s)]
*  You got to get out of the Navy. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5884.84s)]
*  I'm like, okay, whatever. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5886.64s)]
*  Do I have to? [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5887.64s)]
*  And he's like, yeah. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5888.64s)]
*  And I was like, I'd rather not. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5889.64s)]
*  And he's like, okay, too bad. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5891.64s)]
*  And then he was like, okay, you'll be out of the Navy next week. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5894.04s)]
*  And I'm like, that's crazy. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5896.360000000001s)]
*  All right. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5898.56s)]
*  Been doing this for eight years now. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5899.56s)]
*  And then it took eight months to process me out of the Navy. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5902.08s)]
*  And it was crazy because every day I would go into work and think like, oh, this is my [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5907.2s)]
*  last day in the Navy. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5910.4400000000005s)]
*  Cool. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5911.4400000000005s)]
*  For eight months. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5912.4400000000005s)]
*  This is my last day. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5913.4400000000005s)]
*  You got to work as hard as you possibly can, man. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5914.4400000000005s)]
*  Make it count, make it count, make it count. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5916.04s)]
*  And every day I'd go in and just bust my ass. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5917.04s)]
*  And then, dude, like six months in, I'm like, I'm in the fucking Navy forever, man. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5920.0s)]
*  Sounds good. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5924.719999999999s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5925.719999999999s)]
*  Why is that? [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5926.96s)]
*  Is that just standard for paperwork? [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5928.4s)]
*  It's never happened. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5930.32s)]
*  It's never happened, I think, don't quote me, but Elvis Presley was the last guy who [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5932.04s)]
*  got honorably discharged out to make music. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5935.32s)]
*  And I'm not being arrogant in that either. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5938.719999999999s)]
*  I think that's true. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5940.839999999999s)]
*  Damn. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5941.839999999999s)]
*  And it just never happens. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5942.839999999999s)]
*  There's been a lot of stuff with NFL players who are at the academy, the Naval Academy, [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5944.32s)]
*  who are really good at football and getting drafted to the NFL. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5949.2s)]
*  They have to get transferred out and stuff like that. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5951.36s)]
*  But it's never happened to some Joe shit the rag man AO like me. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5953.84s)]
*  And that's when I knew it. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5959.04s)]
*  When my gunner called me that day and he's like, pack your bags. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5960.679999999999s)]
*  I was like, holy fuck. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5963.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh, this is that serious? [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5965.16s)]
*  I called my dad. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5966.84s)]
*  I thought he was going to be disappointed because he was a master chief and stuff. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5967.84s)]
*  And I was supposed to be a master chief. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5971.12s)]
*  My dad had like a bottle of whiskey when I was a kid that said Master Chief Brian on [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5972.36s)]
*  it for me when I made Master Chief. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5975.839999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5977.88s)]
*  I thought when I called my dad, he'd be disappointed, but he was like, hey, man, come home. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5978.88s)]
*  Do it. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5981.719999999999s)]
*  And I thought it would flop. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5982.719999999999s)]
*  I thought it'd be nothing in the year. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5984.32s)]
*  You were already successful online. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5985.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5988.28s)]
*  But I still I never like played a show or anything. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5990.92s)]
*  And then we went like I got out of your first one. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5995.48s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5997.5199999999995s)]
*  What was it? [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5998.5199999999995s)]
*  It was the pageant in St. Louis, Missouri. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=5999.5199999999995s)]
*  How many people? [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6001.88s)]
*  There wasn't a very first one. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6002.88s)]
*  This is unfair to say. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6004.56s)]
*  Like my best friends in Washington when I was in the Navy, I used to play at this place [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6005.56s)]
*  called I used to play like shitty acoustic sets at this place called Off the Hook, where [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6009.2s)]
*  like all the sailors went like on the weekends and shit. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6017.36s)]
*  They had like and my best friends, Austin and Kramer, they used to come to the bar and [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6019.36s)]
*  watch me. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6024.400000000001s)]
*  These two fucking dudes looking at me play. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6025.400000000001s)]
*  And every time I'd finish a song, they'd clap for me, man, because they're they're real [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6027.92s)]
*  friends, you know. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6030.68s)]
*  And that was like the very first show I ever played. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6032.12s)]
*  But the pageant in St. Louis, I got out of the Navy. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6034.08s)]
*  And here's what's weird for me, because musicians have a I'm talking way too much. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6037.4800000000005s)]
*  I apologize. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6044.360000000001s)]
*  No, you're not at all. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6045.0s)]
*  Musicians have usually a pipeline, which drives me crazy. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6046.0s)]
*  I don't know why, but they have a pipeline of like, oh, man, I played small bars and [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6051.12s)]
*  then I played bigger, small bars and then I played the bigger, bigger, small bars. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6056.88s)]
*  Then I went to medium venues and then I went to bigger medium venue. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6062.2s)]
*  And they have this like thing where they're proud of it, of course, which I would be too. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6066.16s)]
*  That's a journey. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6070.12s)]
*  But when I got out of the Navy, I was already like there. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6071.36s)]
*  So I like hopped on a fucking tour bus. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6075.8s)]
*  So, hey, you're going to the pageant in St. Louis. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6077.4400000000005s)]
*  Wow. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6079.2s)]
*  How many people is that? [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6080.2s)]
*  I think two thousand twenty five hundred. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6081.36s)]
*  Wow. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6082.92s)]
*  Which was crazy for me because I never played a show and people blame me a lot for this. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6083.68s)]
*  Like they get mad at me and I'm like, bro, I didn't fucking do this. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6087.56s)]
*  I didn't mean for this to happen. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6091.12s)]
*  Why are they mad at you? [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6092.96s)]
*  Exactly. I agree. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6093.96s)]
*  And it freaks me out, too. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6094.96s)]
*  And I just like I wish I could just I wish I could just like talk to people and be like, [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6096.04s)]
*  hey, man, this is all. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6099.96s)]
*  There's a phrase that I've heard that I've repeated way too much. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6101.8s)]
*  But I'm going to say it one more time. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6104.52s)]
*  This I forget who said this, but we'll look it up. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6107.04s)]
*  All criticism is the tragic result of unmet needs. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6111.04s)]
*  So people who feel like they should be you feel like man, the arena. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6115.68s)]
*  I was thinking about that before I got here. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6119.44s)]
*  Yeah, there's something to that. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6120.68s)]
*  There's something to like what you do with your energy. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6122.76s)]
*  If you're a big old hater, Marshall Rosenberg, father of nonviolent [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6125.64s)]
*  communication, said that every criticism, judgment, diagnosis and expression of anger [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6129.96s)]
*  is the tragic expression of an unmet need. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6134.28s)]
*  Peace requires that we develop the skills to recognize the needs, feelings and values [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6137.6s)]
*  that influence our perspective so that we can respond. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6142.320000000001s)]
*  I forget what it's not. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6145.280000000001s)]
*  Wow. What the rest of the article says. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6146.84s)]
*  That's just the highlight. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6148.96s)]
*  But whatever it is, oh, we respond appropriately. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6150.280000000001s)]
*  Often we react to situations, people that push our buttons that have recognized [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6152.84s)]
*  that our emotions are simply a guide to uncovering the unmet needs inside. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6156.84s)]
*  Instead of looking outwards in blame and judgment, self-awareness helps us see our [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6161.320000000001s)]
*  role in each interaction. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6166.2s)]
*  That's insane. Beautiful. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6168.28s)]
*  Brilliant. And I get that. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6170.08s)]
*  But you're like empathetic to those people. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6171.48s)]
*  You can't be empathetic to someone's mad at you because you're successful. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6174.12s)]
*  I learned I learned the hard like last we did a whole bunch of shit like with ticketing [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6178.12s)]
*  and stuff like that. We tried our best, actually, like as a man, I was like, OK, [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6182.44s)]
*  I'm going to fix this problem. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6187.679999999999s)]
*  I remember we had a conversation on the phone about it. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6189.96s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. I was like, man, it's me. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6192.16s)]
*  I'll be the guy. I'm going to do this. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6194.04s)]
*  And then I did it. And it was just Theo was on the video and stuff for it. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6196.24s)]
*  I like put out the scalpers. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6199.28s)]
*  I was like, I'm going to make everyone register. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6201.36s)]
*  We're going to show IDs at the venue. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6202.92s)]
*  Tickets going to be one hundred fifty bucks no matter what. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6205.12s)]
*  No matter what. I don't care. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6207.84s)]
*  And. Fucking backfired on me because people were just so angry at me about it. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6209.08s)]
*  And I was just trying to do the right thing. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6214.8s)]
*  And so it kind of was everybody angry at you. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6216.72s)]
*  No, some of the people happy with you. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6220.4s)]
*  Of course. Hard to tell. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6222.56s)]
*  Yeah, that's the problem. Exactly. It's hard to tell. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6226.360000000001s)]
*  That's the problem. And that's why in that Dunbar's number, those five close [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6229.04s)]
*  confidants, those are the ones you need to be able to have a conversation with [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6232.8s)]
*  about that kind of shit. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6236.04s)]
*  And that's the thing about my life, which is sorry. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6237.080000000001s)]
*  That's the thing about my life, which is so crazy, [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6239.4400000000005s)]
*  because I have so many people that are so close to me and they know [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6241.240000000001s)]
*  why I do what I do and the feelings that I feel and why I'm. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6244.8s)]
*  Why I try so hard and why I do this, why I do that. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6248.92s)]
*  Same with everyone's life. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6251.56s)]
*  But it's hard, I think, to be a figure or a big figure and. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6253.240000000001s)]
*  Say one thing to those people and then the public guy see something else. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6257.68s)]
*  Right. And it's like, damn, tried tried my hardest, you know, [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6261.52s)]
*  it's crazy, man, is nuts. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6265.240000000001s)]
*  It was like psychotic, like we're saying, though, somewhat. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6266.76s)]
*  There's always going to be someone that's upset. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6269.320000000001s)]
*  And if you have people upset at you, even if it's a small percentage [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6271.52s)]
*  of the people that that feeling is magnified, it feels way worse. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6275.120000000001s)]
*  But even if their feelings are valid, though, to like those, [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6279.92s)]
*  that small amount of people whose feelings are like that, I have that. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6282.320000000001s)]
*  I have that problem. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6285.16s)]
*  It depends on what we're talking about. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6285.84s)]
*  Very true. Depends on what we're talking about. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6287.4400000000005s)]
*  I mean, sometimes it's valid, but sometimes it's just a pure expression [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6288.96s)]
*  of that that paragraph that that guy wrote. Yeah, very, very true. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6291.88s)]
*  It could be that because there's a lot of people are upset [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6295.360000000001s)]
*  because they didn't figure it out and they didn't get the breaks [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6298.8s)]
*  they thought they deserved and they didn't get opportunities [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6303.12s)]
*  or they got a bad role, the dice in terms of like their life [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6307.04s)]
*  and where they grew up and. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6310.72s)]
*  And they get really angry when they see someone who hits the lottery [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6313.36s)]
*  and some people hit the lottery, you know, they respect. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6317.36s)]
*  I think most people respect a long grind to be like the Rolling Stones. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6319.84s)]
*  Like if you're the Rolling Stones, like, how can you not respect that? [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6325.32s)]
*  The guy's 80. He's up there still killing and probably when they were a younger [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6328.2s)]
*  band, they fucking, yeah, grinded and grinded and grinded in those. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6332.24s)]
*  Like I was saying earlier with the small venues, those medium venues [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6336.24s)]
*  and things like that. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6338.639999999999s)]
*  So nobody would hate on the Rolling Stones. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6339.4s)]
*  No, but someone would hate on you [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6341.92s)]
*  because you're new. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6345.639999999999s)]
*  So it's this new thing with this guy like he didn't even have to try that. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6347.24s)]
*  He didn't even play the small ball. This motherfucker was in the Navy. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6351.8s)]
*  Yeah, this is bullshit. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6354.92s)]
*  I've been on the fucking road since I was 12. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6357.12s)]
*  And people forget, man, about the fucking like four or five hours a night [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6360.0s)]
*  I spent after a shift in the Navy, like doing the shit, writing songs, [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6363.36s)]
*  getting good at writing songs. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6369.04s)]
*  People forget that it takes a lot to be a good writer. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6370.44s)]
*  Yeah. You know, and I'm not I'm not talking on my ass. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6373.08s)]
*  I'm saying that that's one thing in my life, this life that I know that I've earned [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6375.0s)]
*  because I've written so many things and I've had so many shitty songs that I've like. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6378.36s)]
*  And I'm like, come on. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6383.32s)]
*  Do you write pen to paper or do you write with a laptop or a pen to paper? [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6384.4s)]
*  I can't. I have fucking 70 notebooks in my truck right now [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6388.5599999999995s)]
*  because I just and they're all like store them. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6392.200000000001s)]
*  Do you like store them like like images of them or anything? [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6394.64s)]
*  No, I think it's kind of cool. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6398.400000000001s)]
*  It is cool. It's very cool. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6400.4800000000005s)]
*  It's not fucking super valuable. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6402.0s)]
*  I know. Last year I had a buddy. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6404.360000000001s)]
*  We were at the studio in Times Square and he had this backpack on my notebook. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6406.240000000001s)]
*  The four of my notebooks were in it with like every like, yeah, [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6410.360000000001s)]
*  I don't know if I should say this, but [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6413.8s)]
*  like every song I'd written in the last like two years and that's scary. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6416.6s)]
*  Left it. Oh, [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6420.4s)]
*  crazy man. No, crazy man. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6423.16s)]
*  Oh, you freak middle of New York City. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6426.16s)]
*  I was terrified, but that's why I don't know if I should say it. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6427.879999999999s)]
*  Someone's going to fucking go on a scavenger hunt and look for your fucking song. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6431.2s)]
*  Exactly. Try to sell them back to you. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6434.839999999999s)]
*  It's crazy. Maybe you can get like a reward. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6436.679999999999s)]
*  Maybe not a reward. Maybe some kid. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6438.96s)]
*  How long ago was this? [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6440.639999999999s)]
*  November last year, a homeless people wipe their ass. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6443.879999999999s)]
*  I know exactly. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6446.4s)]
*  Think about that. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6448.16s)]
*  I wonder if it imagine if there was like a fucking super hit. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6449.6s)]
*  I think about it all the time. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6452.84s)]
*  It's something in the orange. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6454.04s)]
*  It's out there and some homeless guys wiping his ass with it right now. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6455.360000000001s)]
*  And he loves it. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6458.4400000000005s)]
*  And he loves it. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6459.64s)]
*  It feels great. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6460.64s)]
*  I think about it every morning. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6461.4800000000005s)]
*  I wake up and like, fuck, I knew the thought. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6462.72s)]
*  Maybe someone will find it. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6464.4400000000005s)]
*  I think everything happens for a reason, though. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6465.84s)]
*  Yeah. So maybe maybe I had a fucking shitty album in there. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6467.64s)]
*  Oh, I doubt it, dude. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6471.240000000001s)]
*  It's crazy. But yeah, I'm pinned to paper for sure. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6472.6s)]
*  Are you when you write your comedy, are you? [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6474.76s)]
*  I write on a computer. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6476.8s)]
*  I don't you think that hurts it? [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6478.64s)]
*  No, I can write faster. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6480.28s)]
*  And your comedy is hilarious. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6481.52s)]
*  I'm just asking if you think it makes a difference in writing pen to paper. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6482.52s)]
*  I'm hurt in terms of memory. Yes. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6486.12s)]
*  So I write pen to paper when I'm writing stuff down before a show. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6488.4800000000005s)]
*  So I'll write on index cards and I'll write on my notebook before show. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6492.52s)]
*  So I'll write out key bullet points, key important parts of a bit. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6496.84s)]
*  But when I'm writing, I don't want to be hindered by time. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6500.52s)]
*  So if I have a thought, if I'm sitting there and I'm writing [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6504.6s)]
*  and I can type without looking, right, it's like a touch type. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6507.280000000001s)]
*  So as I'm sitting when I have a damn job, when I have ideas, [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6510.120000000001s)]
*  I can get them out like I can write appreciation like that that quick. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6514.0s)]
*  But if I have to write up P. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6517.84s)]
*  Oh, yeah. It takes too much time. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6521.0s)]
*  Yeah, I can. I'm the opposite, man. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6523.080000000001s)]
*  I'm a fucking I'm an ass. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6525.160000000001s)]
*  I'll like take as much time as I can writing the song. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6526.360000000001s)]
*  But that's nothing wrong with that. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6529.360000000001s)]
*  That's yeah, I know a lot of comedian like my friend Mark Norman. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6530.56s)]
*  He carries a stack of index cards in his pocket. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6533.84s)]
*  It's like that. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6536.64s)]
*  Why are you so worried about wasting time? [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6537.64s)]
*  No, it's just better for me with thoughts, with time, like the more [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6540.12s)]
*  like when I'm writing something out, if I have a thought and I got to capture it, [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6545.88s)]
*  if I can get the words onto the screen quicker, [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6549.4400000000005s)]
*  then I have less of a chance of not getting it or yeah, not holding on to the idea. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6553.4400000000005s)]
*  Because if I have to write out a word and they're like, fuck, what was I saying? [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6558.280000000001s)]
*  Where did I go with this? [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6561.68s)]
*  I want to I want to be real sure that I have like a flow [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6562.72s)]
*  of ideas to documenting the ideas, ideas to expanding on the ideas. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6567.96s)]
*  And I don't want to be herky jerky touch typing. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6573.4800000000005s)]
*  I've been there pointing and I don't want to be. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6576.16s)]
*  I mean, you know, poke typing. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6578.04s)]
*  I want to be able to just write when I can just write. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6579.92s)]
*  It's so much I can get so much more done so I can write paragraphs. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6583.6s)]
*  And the more paragraphs I write, the more there's a chance [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6588.0s)]
*  that there's something fertile in there. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6590.8s)]
*  And then I take those things and I take them out. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6592.88s)]

*  I have an idea, but it's just too clunky. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6890.96s)]
*  And then like two years later, I revisit it. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6893.92s)]
*  And now I have a new premise that ties in with it. [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6897.52s)]
*  I'm like, oh, yeah. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6899.76s)]
*  Oh, my God. It slips like a glove. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6900.68s)]
*  It makes sense. Perfect. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6902.72s)]
*  That's what writing songs is like, too, because like fucking you [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6904.16s)]
*  write like three lines. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6906.84s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I was going to say. [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6907.72s)]
*  Like you have times we write a song and you don't like it. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6908.5599999999995s)]
*  But then you come back and you have new ideas and then something from that song. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6912.2s)]
*  So that's how all songs for me are written, at least. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6916.08s)]
*  Except like a few of them, like the huge. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6919.24s)]
*  Here's what's interesting to think about. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6921.04s)]
*  I don't want to say huge coming on an ass, but like the big ones [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6923.36s)]
*  that I've written, the ones that were like successful, they [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6926.28s)]
*  they were always like two minute songs, like sat down and like just fucking jotted. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6929.76s)]
*  And then wrote like did a video and then people loved them. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6934.16s)]
*  And I was like, shit, man. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6936.88s)]
*  But the ones I think about a lot, the ones that I write and write, right. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6938.72s)]
*  They're always like, no one really cares about them. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6941.92s)]
*  It's funny. I'm like, fuck, man. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6944.36s)]
*  Maybe I should just like get drunk and write really fast. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6946.28s)]
*  I think Sturgill Simpson said that about you can have the crown. [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6949.5199999999995s)]
*  Like that one song. I fucking love that song. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6952.5599999999995s)]
*  Sturgill's so good, man. What a hero, man. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6954.96s)]
*  He's the fucking best. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6957.2s)]
*  All those guys are off the grid now living on an island. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6958.8s)]
*  Good for him. Yeah. Look, I look at that motherfucker doesn't play. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6961.32s)]
*  Bro, I follow a fucking Instagram called Where is Sturgill Simpson? [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6963.76s)]
*  You follow that one, too? [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6966.6s)]
*  And it's just like random shit he's doing. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6967.360000000001s)]
*  And I'm like, I just wait for text messages. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6969.16s)]
*  He's one of those guys. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6971.360000000001s)]
*  You like you just watch him exist. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6972.04s)]
*  You think that I love him to death. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6974.08s)]
*  I wish I wish I could meet him or whatever. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6975.68s)]
*  Oh, dude, I will look it up if he's in town. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6977.4400000000005s)]
*  If he comes visit. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6979.76s)]
*  Sometimes I feel bad because, like I said, I know like three chords and shit. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6980.84s)]
*  And Sturgill's writing songs about like metaphysics and all that. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6983.84s)]
*  You know, you know, Sturgill was. Yeah, yeah, that one. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6986.76s)]
*  Where the fuck is Sturgill Simpson? [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6989.52s)]
*  So funny. Yeah. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6991.04s)]
*  There's all these fucking crazy pictures of him with puppies and shit. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6992.32s)]
*  He's a wild bro. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6995.28s)]
*  He's such a man's man. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6996.36s)]
*  I love him to death. Yeah, me too. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=6998.44s)]
*  Love that dude to death. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7000.2s)]
*  I'm so curious about him. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7001.12s)]
*  When I first had him on the podcast, I had heard there's a psychedelic country guy. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7002.48s)]
*  And I'd listen to a couple of songs and then had him on the podcast. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7006.759999999999s)]
*  And I was like, I wonder if this guy's going to want to play music. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7010.44s)]
*  I want to give him a house. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7012.4s)]
*  I wonder if this guy's going to play music. [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7013.48s)]
*  I wonder if he's going to just want to hang out. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7014.88s)]
*  And we just fucking smoke weed and talk shit. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7016.5199999999995s)]
*  It was amazing. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7020.4s)]
*  It was amazing. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7021.68s)]
*  I can't I can't smoke pot, man. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7022.96s)]
*  But you can. It's totally possible. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7025.16s)]
*  I guess. Yeah. I hate to sound like a bitch. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7027.360000000001s)]
*  Do you get paranoid? We smoke a lot of pot. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7029.08s)]
*  Oh, I used to smoke a lot of pot. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7031.0s)]
*  Well, after I got out of the Navy, obviously, I was like, OK, I got to do it now. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7032.360000000001s)]
*  Because I didn't smoke. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7034.88s)]
*  I didn't do drugs like nine years. Right. Obviously. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7035.76s)]
*  I did every day in the Navy. Right. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7037.8s)]
*  And I didn't even know it was a thing. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7040.16s)]
*  And my buddy, Jr., he he he smokes quite a bit. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7041.88s)]
*  And there's nothing wrong with it. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7044.72s)]
*  But, man, I lived in New York for a little bit. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7047.0s)]
*  And one night I got some gas station marijuana gas station [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7049.72s)]
*  from a fucking like corner stop. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7053.12s)]
*  And I like smoked it. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7054.64s)]
*  And I was on this like scaffolding thing in New York looking at the stars. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7055.96s)]
*  And I thought everything was fine. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7059.320000000001s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, my world collapsed, which is such a [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7060.92s)]
*  paranoia, a bitch thing to say. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7063.64s)]
*  I don't really know. I thought my fucking body was collapsing. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7065.320000000001s)]
*  And I thought, you know, it's crazy. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7068.240000000001s)]
*  It was like a positive feedback loop in my head. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7069.76s)]
*  And I was like, oh, man, my body's collapsing. I'm fucked. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7072.320000000001s)]
*  And I called my sister. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7075.68s)]
*  My dog's running around the apartment. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7076.72s)]
*  I'm taking my shirt off, bro. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7078.5199999999995s)]
*  My dog's running around with me. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7080.08s)]
*  I'm like, you got to stay on the phone with me. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7081.28s)]
*  I can't do it. Oh, my God. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7083.24s)]
*  It was crazy. So many people have had that experience. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7085.36s)]
*  But yeah, I know. [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7087.04s)]
*  And it's like, you just got to do it enough to do it. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7088.0s)]
*  But I don't really like there's never been a part of my life [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7089.599999999999s)]
*  where I wanted to do it enough to get to the point where I was OK with it. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7091.68s)]
*  You definitely don't have to. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7094.64s)]
*  And I take like two hits with the guys out there and shit. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7096.2s)]
*  Like, it's not a big deal. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7098.44s)]
*  That's all you need. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7099.76s)]
*  But every time I think it's a different thing, I'm like, OK, [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7100.44s)]
*  this is the time I'm going to fucking know. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7102.5599999999995s)]
*  Lose my mind. You just went way too deep. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7104.5199999999995s)]
*  You do mushrooms occasionally. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7106.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I've been known to do some. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7108.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I've been I I love I love shrimps a lot. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7110.96s)]
*  I think they should be not just legal, [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7115.2s)]
*  but we should have centers where people who are educated [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7117.64s)]
*  in the right dosage and the right, you know, for whatever it is for a person. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7120.92s)]
*  If you want to achieve a certain thing, and they should have like screenings [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7125.96s)]
*  and like mental health screenings for people. [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7130.48s)]
*  And then they should have guided psychedelic experiences. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7132.88s)]
*  And I think it would make the world a better. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7136.4400000000005s)]
*  Don't they do that shit with a pen or something? [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7138.04s)]
*  I don't know. No, I don't think it's a cat. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7140.24s)]
*  They definitely do it with me. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7142.52s)]
*  I don't think it's for everybody. It's not for everybody. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7143.72s)]
*  I don't think anything's for everybody. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7146.4800000000005s)]
*  I think there are some people that have psychological problems [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7148.28s)]
*  and they shouldn't do anything that perturbs their normal state of consciousness. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7151.04s)]
*  Well, I've heard that said by experts. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7154.72s)]
*  So I'm just repeating that. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7157.96s)]
*  And I agree with it because it makes sense to me. [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7159.16s)]
*  But for a lot of people, [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7161.32s)]
*  having a psychedelic experience where you get to see yourself [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7163.799999999999s)]
*  outside of yourself is very beneficial. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7167.2s)]
*  That freaks me out when you talk about like DMT and things like that, even on the show. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7169.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I like I hear you talk about stuff like that. [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7173.28s)]
*  And I'm like, dude, how the fuck does someone just do that to themselves? [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7175.12s)]
*  Not in a bad way. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7178.24s)]
*  I mean, in like a in like a trip way or like if you were to do something like that. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7179.08s)]
*  I have that. I have that. [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7183.2s)]
*  I got a funny story to tell you. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7184.799999999999s)]
*  But I have that fear in me that's like, man, what if it goes wrong? [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7186.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah, what if you never come back? [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7190.08s)]
*  Exactly. We've all heard about was it Keith Moon? [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7191.2s)]
*  Who was it? [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7195.16s)]
*  And who was like the first guy that they said went cuckoo from acid? [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7196.16s)]
*  It was the dude from Pink Floyd, right? [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7203.679999999999s)]
*  No, what's that? [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7207.4s)]
*  Ken Kesey was like the fat, the father of the psychedelic movement. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7211.88s)]
*  He was one of the fathers of the psychedelic. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7217.12s)]
*  I bet back in the day it wasn't as a. [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7218.72s)]
*  Like probably one is good. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7221.88s)]
*  Sid Barrett, right. Sid Barrett was the the Pink Floyd guy, right. [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7223.400000000001s)]
*  And he went crazy from LSD. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7226.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. But didn't someone else go crazy as well? [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7228.4400000000005s)]
*  It's one of the most tragic stories in rock and roll. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7230.4800000000005s)]
*  What do you mean go crazy? [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7232.360000000001s)]
*  Sometimes. Well, you know, Howard Stern talked about this once, too. [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7234.56s)]
*  He said that he took a lot of acid one time and he was really fucked up for a long time. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7237.6s)]
*  And he's really scared that he wasn't going to come back [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7241.240000000001s)]
*  because there have been times where people have had, [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7243.52s)]
*  whether it's LSD or some mind altering substance that for whatever reason [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7247.12s)]
*  that we don't totally understand, they they fucking go and never come back. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7252.12s)]
*  That's so weird. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7257.4400000000005s)]
*  And why would you ever do something like that? [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7258.320000000001s)]
*  Maybe it was Brian Wilson. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7260.4800000000005s)]
*  Did he go crazy from no disrespect to anyone? [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7261.84s)]
*  Sounds as an interesting album. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7264.360000000001s)]
*  Brian Wilson from the Beach Boys. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7266.8s)]
*  Wasn't he the guy that was also tied up with Manson? [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7268.8s)]
*  He was tied up with the Manson family. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7271.4400000000005s)]
*  Well, that's where he was going. Right. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7273.360000000001s)]
*  Manson wanted to make music with him and he was trying to force him to do it. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7275.599999999999s)]
*  Right. So that's probably why he was doing all that. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7278.799999999999s)]
*  And he made him do acid because Manson was doing acid. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7281.24s)]
*  And Manson was dude Manson for the millionth time. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7283.679999999999s)]
*  I'll talk about this. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7287.32s)]
*  How Charles Manson ruined Dennis Wilson's life. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7288.36s)]
*  Oh, brother brother of Brian Wilson never went to dare. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7290.719999999999s)]
*  So Dennis Wilson was like the guy who was going to manage him, right? [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7294.879999999999s)]
*  Or something like that. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7297.16s)]
*  I believe so. Yeah. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7297.839999999999s)]
*  Like that. He was looking for his house, I think. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7298.719999999999s)]
*  But those the Manson family, most likely. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7301.36s)]
*  Was like a CIA project. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7305.5199999999995s)]
*  Most likely it was a project of MKUltra. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7307.599999999999s)]
*  And it's documented by this guy, Tom O'Neill, in this book called Chaos. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7310.679999999999s)]
*  It's an amazing book that talks about the CIA's LSD program. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7314.32s)]
*  They were dosing people all over the place with LSD. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7318.799999999999s)]
*  They had a thing called Operation Midnight Climax, where they would go to a brothel [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7321.5599999999995s)]
*  and they would have, you know, 3D or see through mirrors [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7326.24s)]
*  so they could see through and watch the the Johns. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7330.32s)]
*  And the prostitute would give the John a drink that was laced with acid. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7332.88s)]
*  So this guy would take this drink and just fucking trip balls. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7337.08s)]
*  They would monitor them and they would talk to them. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7339.84s)]
*  And then they did a bunch of different things where they had the [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7342.400000000001s)]
*  the LSD studies that they did out of Harvard that actually created. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7346.04s)]
*  Most likely was a factor in creating Ted Kaczynski, [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7349.72s)]
*  because the Unabomber was a part of those LSD studies. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7353.16s)]
*  And then this reminds me of Pineapple Express. [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7355.92s)]
*  While he was tripping balls, was thinking that technology [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7357.96s)]
*  is going to kill all the people. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7361.48s)]
*  So he has to kill the people that are making technology. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7362.959999999999s)]
*  And by the way, I'm not condoning what he did, but it's logical. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7365.28s)]
*  It's logical. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7370.879999999999s)]
*  That's an episode of Black Mirror. It's logical. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7372.28s)]
*  It seems like it would be an episode of Black Mirror, where the computers [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7374.32s)]
*  become far more intelligent than human beings and they have no use for them [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7377.839999999999s)]
*  anymore. And they in fact, they find human beings to be a problem. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7381.719999999999s)]
*  Like that's that's the idea that you're going to create a new life form [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7385.16s)]
*  that's far more intelligent than you. [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7388.2s)]
*  I'm going to say that technology is going to take over people. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7389.96s)]
*  You think it's no way me and Danny talk about all the time. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7392.52s)]
*  Well, people smarter than me don't think it's going to happen. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7395.76s)]
*  Like Mark Andreessen. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7398.56s)]
*  I feel that way. And I'm not smart at all. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7399.64s)]
*  Sometimes we talk about it. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7402.24s)]
*  I'm like, there's no way in hell that people let things get that far to where. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7403.24s)]
*  I don't think we have a chance. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7406.16s)]
*  I don't think we have a chance. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7408.24s)]
*  Again, I think instead or this is this is the problem. [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7409.36s)]
*  And I'm not saying the capitalism is a bad thing. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7412.84s)]
*  But when corporations are primarily around to make money [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7415.24s)]
*  and they have an obligation to their stakeholders, they're always going to make money. [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7421.0s)]
*  If this new frontier is opening up and it's called artificial intelligence [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7424.32s)]
*  and you're a part of that and you start making money doing that, [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7428.96s)]
*  that fucking train is on the tracks, baby. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7432.44s)]
*  And there's no brakes. We're not going to stop them from making art. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7435.44s)]
*  They already got chat GPT. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7439.639999999999s)]
*  They can have fucking conversations. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7441.12s)]
*  Right. And getting diagnosed illnesses and tell you how to fix your car. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7442.92s)]
*  I have this problem where I believe in humanity, though. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7447.2s)]
*  I do, too. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7449.759999999999s)]
*  No, not that you don't. I wasn't like inducing that. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7450.92s)]
*  I was just saying that. I'm just a realist. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7453.16s)]
*  Yeah, but that's just a little crazy. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7455.44s)]
*  Listen, man, they're not going to stop making it. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7457.28s)]
*  So if they're not going to stop making it, where's it going to go? [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7459.36s)]
*  It's going to go to a life form. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7461.44s)]
*  It's just a matter of how much time does it take. [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7463.28s)]
*  I don't understand the technology. [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7464.96s)]
*  So I can't say that it's 50 years from now or 100 years from now or five weeks from now. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7466.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know what it is, but they're going to be able to create a life form. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7470.56s)]
*  Wow. There it is, dude. [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7475.52s)]
*  This is going to be this is what I don't understand. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7477.6s)]
*  You see. Sorry for interrupting. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7479.320000000001s)]
*  No, please. This is what I don't understand. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7480.4800000000005s)]
*  You see those videos. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7482.400000000001s)]
*  You've been seeing them for like five years. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7483.240000000001s)]
*  I like those weird, like robotic heads talking that look like real faces and things like that. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7484.400000000001s)]
*  And this is really elementary. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7488.96s)]
*  I just mean like those weird bald mannequin looking heads. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7491.120000000001s)]
*  We're communicating robot looking at the AI looking things. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7494.88s)]
*  That's what happened for five years. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7498.04s)]
*  Oh, yeah. When's it when's the when's like what everyone's scared of? [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7499.8s)]
*  Can I? Well, they've got some pretty sophisticated ones out of I believe Japan now. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7503.16s)]
*  There's Whitney and her robot. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7508.72s)]
*  Yeah, I thought you were just pulling that girls, man. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7509.96s)]
*  I was like, what the hell? [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7512.28s)]
*  That's my friend, Whitney Cummings, and that's her robot. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7513.0s)]
*  So Whitney Cummings robot can like talk and say things and she has it say jokes. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7515.16s)]
*  That's a fucking nightmare. [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7519.6s)]
*  It's hilarious. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7521.24s)]
*  Not Whitney Cummings twice, but like the fact that there's a robot. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7522.2s)]
*  Well, she thinks it's hilarious. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7525.56s)]
*  That's that's so scary. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7527.24s)]
*  A ton of inappropriate jokes about the robot does. [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7528.68s)]
*  No, she puts them in the robot's face. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7531.64s)]
*  But she's holding its face. [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7534.56s)]
*  Yeah, she took its head off. [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7536.12s)]
*  Yeah. Well, this is like very rudimentary, like that kind of robot. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7537.68s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I mean by that. [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7541.08s)]
*  It's like I feel like everything you've seen online when it comes to AI and things [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7542.240000000001s)]
*  like that, it's all. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7546.16s)]

*  Like what's going on somewhere else when it comes to AI and things like that? [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7550.4800000000005s)]

*  This has been interesting in the music [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7571.88s)]
*  industry because people like people fucking every day, man, 20 people send me [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7573.48s)]
*  a song by an AI bot that I wrote. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7578.679999999999s)]
*  And it's almost insulting because I see the songs and it's like, [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7581.8s)]
*  it's crazy to see the lyrics that these AI bots come up with. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7585.360000000001s)]
*  I'm like, man, I got to write fucking better songs. [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7587.88s)]
*  You see it. I'm like, man, I wrote that to this AI bot and it scares the shit out [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7589.84s)]
*  of me, but I'm also like, like when I think of my head and like think about what I can [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7594.8s)]
*  write personally from my heart, I'm like, there's no way AI is ever. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7598.64s)]
*  It's not going to be able to replicate [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7602.84s)]
*  what your lived, felt experiences can convey in a creative way, [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7604.8s)]
*  which I think is smarter than people think. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7609.56s)]
*  And I think that'll always reign supreme. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7611.6s)]
*  But I think it's going to make some hits. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7613.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, there was like a bunch of there was like a drink song. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7615.88s)]
*  Yeah, I was going to mention it, but I didn't want to like, [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7618.8s)]
*  apparently was huge. [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7622.080000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Look, it's going to make some hits. [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7623.320000000001s)]
*  And that's not against Drake. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7625.64s)]
*  Drake can still make hits, too, but AI can make Drake hits. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7629.200000000001s)]
*  And that's what's crazy. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7633.4800000000005s)]
*  It's like when you get to a certain point, like if you have a certain style of music, [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7634.76s)]
*  like I wonder if it can do jazz. [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7640.36s)]
*  I don't really have a real understanding of jazz. [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7642.72s)]
*  I feel like it would be easier to do jazz than this is not an insult towards jazz [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7645.5599999999995s)]
*  musicians. I respect them. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7649.5199999999995s)]
*  I feel like it could do jazz well because it has so many notes and perfect like [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7651.84s)]
*  slides and things to go off of when it comes like songwriting. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7656.44s)]
*  It might be a little different. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7659.32s)]
*  Imagine if it did jazz better than the jazz [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7660.4s)]
*  musicians and everybody got mad. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7662.599999999999s)]
*  That'd be crazy. Oh, jazz musicians would be pissed. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7664.32s)]
*  They'd be so mad. [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7667.5199999999995s)]
*  They'd be so mad, man. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7668.28s)]
*  There'd be a bunch of fucking breweries just up in flames. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7669.4s)]
*  You go into some independent coffee shop [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7672.4s)]
*  and they're just all pissed. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7674.48s)]
*  And there's jazz playing, some fucking dude. [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7675.88s)]
*  But it's AI jazz. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7678.36s)]
*  But it's amazing. [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7679.679999999999s)]
*  Like, oh, my God. [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7681.28s)]
*  Because if AI is that smart. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7682.96s)]
*  Some dude with a bass just fucking pissed. [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7684.76s)]
*  Right. If you think about what like every they say, I don't know anything about music. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7687.24s)]
*  Let me just say this real quick. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7690.84s)]
*  But they say that every note is apparently been played like all of them. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7692.32s)]
*  Right. Yes. OK. [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7696.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't know if this is true, but Bach [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7697.24s)]
*  don't I don't know anything about music either. [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7699.639999999999s)]
*  But Bach when isn't this AI then? [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7701.48s)]
*  Isn't that a program? [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7704.679999999999s)]
*  Jamie, you're freaking me out. [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7705.72s)]
*  But no, that's the same thing. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7706.92s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7708.48s)]
*  That's program that those pieces of paper or those holes in that paper or whatever [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7710.04s)]
*  the fuck that thing is that scroll. [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7713.76s)]
*  But what's artificial intelligence, right? [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7716.12s)]
*  That's the same thing. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7717.96s)]
*  You're feeding it a bunch of shit to then recreate without some. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7718.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but it's not. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7722.36s)]
*  That's mechanical. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7723.36s)]
*  It's not growing. [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7724.5199999999995s)]
*  It doesn't grow inside itself. [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7725.2s)]
*  That's why AI is fucking scary. [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7727.36s)]
*  That's like saying an automatic watch is artificial. [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7728.84s)]
*  Or like factories are artificial intelligence. [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7732.36s)]
*  All the gears are spinning and ticking and keeping perfect time. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7734.08s)]
*  No, that's mechanical. [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7737.04s)]
*  That's engineering. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7738.28s)]
*  You know, have some respect for him. [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7739.28s)]
*  And that's what I feel like that's what Andreessen was sort of saying. [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7741.08s)]
*  Like it's just like reading off of the Internet sort of and saying words [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7744.28s)]
*  that sort of to us sounds make sense. [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7748.72s)]
*  Sure. For now. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7750.88s)]
*  But yeah, that's the thing people have been saying forever. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7752.04s)]
*  Christ. Did you see the Black Mirror episode? [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7755.08s)]
*  Um, with the AI and the likeness thing and they they can steal your likeness [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7757.32s)]
*  and they be creates on that one. Did I say that one? [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7762.8s)]
*  Maybe I didn't. [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7765.5599999999995s)]
*  And the tick tock fucking things are this is exactly it. [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7766.5199999999995s)]
*  This has just been around for 150 years and it's very close to it. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7769.36s)]
*  This replaced a piano player, you know, from the Wild Wild West. [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7773.88s)]
*  But it'll always play the exact same thing. [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7776.72s)]
*  Yeah. And it sounds the exact same every time you play. [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7778.679999999999s)]
*  So they have the Wild Wild West. [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7780.44s)]
*  This is old as shit. [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7781.84s)]
*  Yeah, these are really. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7782.76s)]
*  See, that's what I'm trying to say about people. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7784.24s)]
*  They keep saying that sounds like someone's playing. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7785.96s)]
*  That sounds like a place where someone's getting shot. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7788.84s)]
*  Right. How do they make that? [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7791.24s)]
*  When do you say these are old? [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7793.4s)]
*  I don't know that when they were first invented, but these are not new. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7795.32s)]
*  And they're old. [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7798.4400000000005s)]
*  Got to get one of them. Alarm clock. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7799.4800000000005s)]
*  We should have one of those in the studio. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7801.32s)]
*  Got to see. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7802.96s)]
*  That's not, you know, bro. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7804.04s)]
*  How much do you think one of those costs a player piano right now? [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7806.28s)]
*  We should have one in the studio. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7809.16s)]
*  What's a player piano? Is that what it's called? [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7810.6s)]
*  There's a play like they act because we should get one of them old ones. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7813.12s)]
*  Supposedly a player would be dope just to have around just for the virus. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7815.6s)]
*  As little as two grand. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7818.76s)]
*  Put it in here, man. [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7819.6s)]
*  So next time this comes up, you can just just play it. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7821.6s)]
*  And there's no room in here. [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7823.84s)]
*  We have the perfect amount of things that are in here. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7825.240000000001s)]
*  We have no room in here, but out there, we have room. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7827.0s)]
*  Thank you. Beautiful. [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7828.84s)]

*  And I think we either are going to merge [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7836.0s)]

*  Agreed. [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=7870.6s)]

*  ideas, like throwing preposterous ideas that are well articulated out there to [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8128.8s)]

*  Like the idea that for ideology, we're going to abandon this thing that we have [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8316.2s)]
*  always known, which is that children are very impressionable and very malleable [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8320.6s)]

*  trans is probably homophobic and that someone encouraging them to become trans, [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8347.64s)]

*  But as a human being, you only have one. [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8353.36s)]
*  Sorry. I was going to say, because he was saying that and this is true that in Iran, [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8355.16s)]
*  I believe they have like a large amount of transgender women. [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8359.68s)]
*  And the reason being is that homosexuality is illegal. [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8364.199999999999s)]
*  Yes, it's strange. [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8366.68s)]
*  So because it's illegal, the way they get [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8368.199999999999s)]
*  around that is some of these men become trans. [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8370.16s)]
*  Whoa. Which is wild. [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8373.96s)]
*  I see in the Middle East is a weird. [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8376.199999999999s)]
*  I don't know anything like actually, but in the Middle East is a weird feeling [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8377.8s)]
*  around it, like if you're walking around, because I was I was in Bahrain and things [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8380.72s)]
*  like that, and you'll go out in town and there's there's like a femininity to like [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8384.32s)]
*  a lot of the guys and you're like, oh, that's kind of listen. [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8387.56s)]
*  There's a certain percentage of guys or gay in all of the world. [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8390.76s)]
*  Yeah, of course. It's just a part of being a person. [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8395.519999999999s)]
*  And that's what like a lot of this stuff [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8398.88s)]
*  that came out about the whole transgender thing with me. [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8401.16s)]
*  I'm not defending anything either. [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8404.64s)]
*  I don't care. [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8406.08s)]
*  My sister is gay and she married a [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8408.28s)]
*  transgender person and they're both close to my heart. [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8412.76s)]
*  And all I know as a human being and a man is to like love them because they're my [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8415.6s)]
*  family, of course, and that's it. [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8419.16s)]

*  I don't care if you support the kid thing or not. [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8424.560000000001s)]
*  I just love them. [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8427.32s)]
*  And that's what being a human being is, is knowing your own perspective and working [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8428.36s)]
*  from there. [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8432.36s)]
*  And I didn't realize it was going to start such a battle defending someone that I [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8433.36s)]
*  love so much, you know, because they're they're [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8436.16s)]

*  And that is my picture in my head of a transgender person. [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8447.32s)]
*  Well, that's how all people should be looked at as individuals and respected. [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8452.039999999999s)]
*  And individuals are what we should concentrate on. [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8456.88s)]
*  Like, but the problem is everything's so tribal today. [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8460.76s)]
*  That's why this Bud Light thing went so [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8465.480000000001s)]
*  bonkers, because they the people that enjoy Bud Light are completely the opposite [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8467.28s)]
*  tribe for the most part. Well, I think a large number of them than the tribe [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8471.84s)]
*  that's into following Dylan Mulvaney. [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8475.44s)]
*  I never cared about anything that my entire life. [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8477.880000000001s)]
*  How these fucking people care so much about it. [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8480.84s)]
*  And I'm like, dude, you guys are. [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8482.92s)]
*  They felt like it was taken over their thing. [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8484.16s)]
*  This like it's like if Fox News went all gay, [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8487.400000000001s)]
*  if Fox News just became the gay news and they're like, no, [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8491.16s)]
*  and every every anchor was gay and they [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8495.480000000001s)]
*  talked about everything from a gay perspective. [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8497.52s)]
*  So much hate, man. [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8499.640000000001s)]
*  You know, like, let's look at gays in Ukraine and, you know, [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8501.0s)]
*  like, no matter what it is, let's look at it from a gay people would go crazy. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8503.52s)]
*  Yeah, I can't imagine waking up with that much. [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8507.0s)]
*  So I think that's what people felt like was happening with the Bud Light can. [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8509.36s)]
*  And what bothered me a lot, it was like, I empathize. [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8514.44s)]
*  I see both sides and like people think I didn't. [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8517.2s)]
*  I was like, oh, man, I get it, man. [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8519.800000000001s)]
*  I understand both both of these realms of people. [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8521.080000000002s)]
*  I'm like, the problem is people like take it serious forever. [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8523.560000000001s)]
*  Like they would Bud Light drinkers for fucking 30 years and they'll die on this hill. [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8527.0s)]
*  And all of a sudden, like now, fuck Bud Light forever. [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8530.6s)]
*  I don't care, man. [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8533.36s)]
*  And you just see Modelo cans everywhere, bro. [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8534.32s)]

*  And I'm like, bro, I don't I'm out of all of this. [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8545.0s)]
*  I just want to drink a Budweiser, bro. [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8547.2s)]
*  I was reading about this bar owner that [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8548.84s)]

*  Look at this American flag them on. [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8571.6s)]

*  Like regular folks that work in breweries are getting fired [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8576.32s)]
*  because the demand is down. [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8579.480000000001s)]

*  You were talking about that earlier before we got on here. [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8588.800000000001s)]
*  And you were saying they were down like the market cap or whatever. [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8590.720000000001s)]
*  Let's see what the number is. [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8593.24s)]
*  Like what is I've been checking the stock every day, but I guess I just more than 20 [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8594.44s)]
*  billion, they've lost more than 20 billion dollars. [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8597.880000000001s)]
*  You don't smoke cigarettes in here, do you? [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8601.04s)]
*  No. Yeah, go ahead. [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8602.28s)]
*  Sure. Yeah, we got a fan. [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8603.28s)]
*  It sucks the cigarettes out. [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8604.320000000002s)]
*  We have we smoke cigars in here and don't smoke. [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8605.68s)]
*  Smoke my [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8609.08s)]
*  they lost a ton of money. [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8610.96s)]
*  The point is it's not good. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8612.16s)]
*  It's real bad. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8615.28s)]
*  And it's who the fuck saw that coming? [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8617.24s)]
*  Who thought that people were going to be that upset? [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8619.36s)]
*  That's what blows my mind is so many people. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8621.48s)]
*  My looks. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8623.52s)]
*  You don't hear a lot of stories where the the like the population can actually [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8624.96s)]
*  control the companies, right? [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8628.68s)]
*  Share price and thing. [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8631.0s)]
*  And dude, there's a part of me like the humorous part of me where I'm like, holy [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8631.8s)]
*  shit. Good job, guys, man. [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8634.84s)]
*  You fucking killed it. [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8637.0s)]
*  But it's so wrong. [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8638.12s)]
*  Like definitely can if, you know, they have a point [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8639.28s)]
*  Bud Light sales down by 27.1 percent. [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8644.04s)]
*  I don't even know. [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8647.6s)]
*  I don't even know what started it is what's funny. [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8648.52s)]
*  I just I saw, dude, I got on Twitter one day just like everyone else and out of [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8650.8s)]
*  context responded to somebody and everyone hated me all of a sudden. [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8653.880000000001s)]
*  I was like, holy shit. [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8656.76s)]
*  I think what they're saying was the just find out what the market cap loss was, [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8657.52s)]
*  because that was the just Google [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8661.560000000001s)]
*  Anheuser-Busch market cap loss, 21 billion. [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8664.2s)]
*  Google that. That's heinous. [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8668.720000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8671.4s)]
*  That is crazy. [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8672.92s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8675.92s)]
*  But there's no way that 27 billion Bud Light maker Anheuser-Busch in Bev has lost [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8676.84s)]
*  a whopping 27 billion in market value in the wake of his star cross partnership [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8683.08s)]
*  with Dylan Mulvaney, most recently slammed by a four percent stock drop this week. [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8687.96s)]
*  That's June 2nd. [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8692.48s)]
*  So that's more than a month ago. [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8693.92s)]
*  This is July 4th. [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8696.359999999999s)]
*  It says six. [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8697.48s)]
*  Hmm. [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8700.039999999999s)]
*  It's different. [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8702.0s)]
*  Wait, what is it? Is that 60 billion or six? [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8703.0s)]
*  How do you hate something that much, man? [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8705.64s)]
*  Six billion. [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8707.8s)]
*  Oh, I was looking at all the zeros with no. [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8708.759999999998s)]
*  How they have all those zeros with no fucking commas. [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8710.96s)]
*  That's rude. I was in like an emotional. [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8713.279999999999s)]
*  Isn't that ridiculous? [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8715.359999999999s)]
*  I was in a pretty weird place when all this stuff happened, too, [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8716.8s)]
*  because there was like a shooting in [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8719.08s)]
*  in Colorado or something where some dude, some some guy, he like ran into a [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8722.439999999999s)]
*  transgender bar or something, a gay bar or something and just killed a few people. [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8727.119999999999s)]
*  And it was crazy. [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8732.039999999999s)]
*  My sister was really emotional about it because she's gay. [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8732.92s)]
*  And when all this wasn't that like a non-binary person, too, [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8735.72s)]
*  that was this that was the tech. [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8740.16s)]
*  I don't know what that was. [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8741.96s)]
*  That was a crazy one because that was the son, I think, [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8743.56s)]
*  of a guy who is a former guy, a guy who was an MMA fighter. [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8747.68s)]
*  Well, which was also a porn star. [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8752.6s)]
*  The bar. Yeah. [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8754.56s)]
*  Isn't that scary? Yeah. [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8756.199999999999s)]
*  Terrifying. My sister was really, really up in arms. [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8758.52s)]
*  But she's really emotional about it. [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8761.039999999999s)]
*  And I'm my best friend in the world. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8762.199999999999s)]
*  I would do anything just like you would probably for you. [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8763.92s)]
*  Any siblings? Yeah, I have a sister. [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8766.16s)]
*  And she's my best friend no matter what. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8767.76s)]
*  That's awesome. [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8770.039999999999s)]
*  Thick and thin. But that's why I love my sister, too. [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8770.52s)]
*  She's awesome. Exactly. [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8773.36s)]
*  And you would defend her to the bits. [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8774.28s)]
*  So this is like some just really ill person who went into a bar and started [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8777.0s)]
*  shooting people. But I [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8781.44s)]
*  I don't know what the motivation was. [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8784.12s)]
*  I don't either. My sister, my sister was saying that like [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8786.52s)]
*  they were under she was under attack and things. [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8790.880000000001s)]
*  And I'm like, I don't like I just didn't like as a as a young guy. [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8792.960000000001s)]
*  I just both ends. [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8797.2s)]
*  She felt like it was an attack on gay people. [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8798.92s)]
*  Exactly. And I talked with her about it. [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8800.960000000001s)]
*  Like as just a normal person, I'm like, is it an attack on your people or is [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8803.04s)]
*  it is an individualized event that's terrible and heartbreaking and things like [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8806.6s)]
*  that and I think it's that because I think that person, [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8810.84s)]
*  like I said, I think that person was a member of the LBGT. [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8815.480000000001s)]
*  I'm pretty sure people are just scared, man. [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8819.640000000001s)]
*  That's so shitty or something along those lines. [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8822.960000000001s)]
*  But either way, it's a human being doing [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8825.6s)]
*  something evil to a bunch of other human beings. [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8827.6s)]
*  It's crazy. Times now. [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8829.92s)]
*  Crazy, man. [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8832.16s)]
*  Do you think it was like this when [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8834.04s)]
*  like when you were younger, were things as like polarizing? [[02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8836.6s)]
*  No, no. [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8839.44s)]
*  What do you think? What do you think changed things? [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8841.04s)]
*  Well, for one, the communication for one, [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8842.8s)]
*  social media is exacerbated, exacerbated. [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8845.8s)]
*  The gap is like [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8848.8s)]
*  made us more divided, I think, than ever before. [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8851.16s)]
*  People huddle up in these like echo chambers. [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8854.36s)]
*  You think it made things better at all? [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8856.92s)]
*  It made access to information better. [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8858.8s)]
*  It made people more informed. [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8860.76s)]
*  But it's difficult to navigate those waters and not everybody's going to do it. [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8861.92s)]
*  Some people are going to crash on the rocks. [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8864.92s)]
*  And I think that it's a new thing that people are trying to navigate. [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8867.28s)]
*  I think there's a lot of people that are horribly addicted to it. [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8871.76s)]
*  And they're just constantly involved in these interactions with other people. [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8875.52s)]
*  And most of them are feuds and disagreements. [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8882.800000000001s)]
*  And they're trying to one up each other and trying to like [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8885.36s)]
*  post facts and dunk on people. [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8888.0s)]
*  And so I always question validity of like, [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8890.800000000001s)]
*  I always question validity of [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8893.84s)]
*  artists and things now. [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8896.2s)]
*  Like, do you think people are better for it or worse for it when it comes to talent? [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8897.6s)]
*  Like, does the cream rise to the top faster now or does it just make everyone great? [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8901.56s)]
*  I don't know how to word this. [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8907.4s)]
*  Make everyone great how? [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8909.36s)]
*  Myself, like when I started putting videos on Twitter and things like that, [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8911.04s)]
*  I wouldn't have been discovered in the 70s because I would have just been playing [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8915.64s)]
*  guitar on a fire. Do you think? [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8918.519999999999s)]
*  And there's I don't mean this from my own ego. [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8921.76s)]
*  I'm just saying in general, [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8923.92s)]
*  do you think people are more talented for it because they have to compete [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8925.4s)]
*  with millions and millions of people now? [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8928.84s)]
*  Or do you think people are less talented for it because [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8930.56s)]
*  millions and millions of people are getting famous? [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8933.4s)]
*  I think in general, the talented people of today, [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8935.92s)]
*  like every other generation with every other kind of art form and even most sports, [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8939.76s)]
*  the generations as they progress, [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8945.16s)]
*  they have the benefit of learning from the previous generation. [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8948.32s)]
*  So we all imitate each other, whether it's like Mike Tyson [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=8951.48s)]

*  we might sound like idiots if this doesn't exist, but they were saying that [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9341.4s)]
*  like in the classrooms in like China and things like that or whatever country. [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9344.56s)]
*  They have like video cameras that monitor where eyes are going. [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9349.279999999999s)]
*  That's what they were talking about in this thing. [[02:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9352.72s)]
*  So these kids had these headsets on and they were monitoring their faces to make [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9354.8s)]
*  sure that they were looking at their phones and they weren't looking somewhere [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9360.68s)]
*  else and then this headgear they had on it was indicating whether or not they were [[02:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9364.0s)]
*  paying attention. [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9368.8s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9371.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9371.92s)]
*  So I guess it's like a different frequency. [[02:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9372.48s)]
*  But doesn't that make you a different person? [[02:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9374.92s)]
*  Like when you're cheating in class, it's like a fourth grader. [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9376.32s)]
*  Doesn't that make you resourceful? [[02:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9378.16s)]
*  It does a little. [[02:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9379.88s)]
*  That's why I believe in like the American. [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9381.119999999999s)]
*  Like I'm conflicted in my own head because like all these this has nothing to do [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9383.0s)]
*  with what we're talking about. But [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9386.68s)]
*  like a lot of right wingers and left wingers, I feel like they have like [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9389.039999999999s)]
*  the wrong idea of what the American spirit is. [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9391.92s)]
*  But also on this hand, I'm like America is the best country in the world. [[02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9394.119999999999s)]
*  We got to figure it out. [[02:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9398.6s)]
*  We're like the American spirit is alive and well. [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9400.039999999999s)]
*  And I think we'd be fine if it came down to it. [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9402.52s)]
*  If we fall apart to totalitarianism, [[02:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9405.08s)]
*  it's a giant blow to humanity [[02:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9407.720000000001s)]
*  because if totalitarian reaches a place that has the most freedom [[02:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9410.28s)]
*  and the problem with freedom is people are willing to give it up if it suits [[02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9414.880000000001s)]
*  their side. And you're hearing this from people all the time. [[02:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9417.960000000001s)]
*  You used to hear from people on the right, but now you're hearing it from people on [[02:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9420.640000000001s)]
*  the left where they're willing to silence people's free speech if they think that [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9423.28s)]
*  what they're saying is dangerous and you can't do that because no one gets to [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9427.640000000001s)]
*  decide what's dangerous and what's not dangerous. [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9431.68s)]
*  Because if you allow people to, they keep moving that fucking goalpost [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9433.44s)]
*  and then they'll silence you. [[02:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9436.84s)]
*  And then if you're a liberal and you vote for this, you want this to happen, [[02:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9438.199999999999s)]
*  then it gets in place and then a Republican wins. [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9442.0s)]
*  And they use that same thing to stifle liberalism. [[02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9444.56s)]
*  It's all competition. [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9447.279999999999s)]
*  So this is the kids with the things in their head. [[02:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9448.119999999999s)]
*  And that green light is apparently or one of the different color lights. [[02:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9450.24s)]
*  White means you're offline. [[02:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9455.119999999999s)]
*  It looks so happy. [[02:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9456.439999999999s)]
*  You're not paying attention. [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9457.199999999999s)]
*  This is a Black Mirror episode. [[02:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9458.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah, this is wild. [[02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9459.96s)]
*  And so they use facial recognition to make sure the kids are paying attention. [[02:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9462.48s)]
*  Who owns the Wall Street Journal? [[02:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9466.8s)]
*  Look at this facial recognition. [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9468.48s)]
*  I do not know. [[02:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9469.96s)]
*  Look at their facial recognition. [[02:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9471.0s)]
*  How wild is that? [[02:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9472.16s)]
*  That's what I was talking about with the Proctor exam I was taking. [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9473.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9475.84s)]
*  Imagine. But, dude, there's such a fine line between safety and cheating and like. [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9477.199999999999s)]
*  Is it good or bad? [[02:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9484.8s)]
*  Well, it's not cheating, but it definitely is enforcing concentration. [[02:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9486.08s)]
*  So is the if the results are better, right? [[02:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9490.6s)]
*  If they get better grades, is that worth it to completely give up freedom like that [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9493.800000000001s)]
*  and to have a fucking headband? [[02:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9498.800000000001s)]
*  And then people don't rise to the top either. [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9500.16s)]
*  If they're great, these probably still will. [[02:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9502.52s)]
*  Because even if you're paying attention, you must be you might be just a dumbass. [[02:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9506.04s)]
*  You know, whereas some people are paying attention and they have brilliant ideas. [[02:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9510.04s)]
*  Like you're always I think there's always going to be competition, whether you're [[02:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9513.0s)]
*  focusing or there's there's going to be more competition, probably, [[02:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9516.72s)]
*  because more people will be forced to be disciplined, you know, forced to be [[02:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9520.519999999999s)]
*  forced to do the work as opposed to like fucking off and procrastinating. [[02:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9524.519999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but those people do amazing shit, too. [[02:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9529.76s)]
*  Like the shitty guys, man, in class. [[02:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9531.76s)]
*  I was shitty. [[02:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9533.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9534.32s)]
*  I never had good I was always shitty. [[02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9534.92s)]
*  Like teachers hated me. [[02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9537.119999999999s)]
*  And if you want good songs, you know what I mean? [[02:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9538.359999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9541.4s)]
*  And also, I don't have kids yet. [[02:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9542.199999999999s)]
*  If your kid came home and was like, hey, I had this [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9545.48s)]
*  headband on today that was making sure I didn't look to the paper next to me. [[02:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9549.0s)]
*  How would you feel about it? [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9553.64s)]
*  Not good. I would not be into that. [[02:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9556.119999999999s)]
*  I would not allow that. [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9558.4s)]
*  I would I would I would find another school that I just I just think you have [[02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9559.64s)]
*  to have a certain amount of freedom, especially coming from a person like me, [[02:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9563.24s)]
*  who's a creative person like I do what I do doesn't it didn't exist. [[02:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9566.8s)]
*  When I was a kid, it's a new thing, [[02:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9572.36s)]
*  like to be able to podcast or stand up always existed. [[02:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9574.400000000001s)]
*  But that's also like it's a very creative thing. [[02:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9577.68s)]
*  It's got to be able to freedom. [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9580.44s)]
*  Yeah. Podcasting is fairly new. [[02:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9582.2s)]
*  Right. It's like 20 years old. [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9583.84s)]
*  But stand up is, you know, 100 years old or whatever it is. [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9585.92s)]
*  But like the most recent versions of it, [[02:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9589.12s)]
*  you can't have that unless you have freedom of expression. [[02:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9592.0s)]
*  You can't have it. [[02:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9595.560000000001s)]
*  It won't exist. [[02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9596.560000000001s)]
*  And you have to primary school stops [[02:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9597.960000000001s)]
*  using headbands to study pupils, concentration levels after public outcry. [[02:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9599.800000000001s)]
*  That's good. [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9603.2s)]
*  That's good. [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9603.76s)]
*  Well, that's good that this is public outcry. [[02:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9604.88s)]
*  This was four years ago. [[02:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9606.519999999999s)]
*  This article got posted. [[02:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9607.4s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9608.679999999998s)]
*  It's weird that the video has been going around even recently. [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9609.32s)]
*  Yeah. Interesting. [[02:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9612.24s)]
*  So the people reciprocating information. [[02:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9613.76s)]
*  Well, the outcry probably just keeps [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9616.119999999999s)]
*  continuing because people are terrified of that being the dystopian future that [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9618.199999999999s)]
*  we're all monitored constantly by Big Brother and that we give into it because [[02:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9622.56s)]
*  we want a little bit of comfort, which is what's fucking scary. [[02:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9626.4s)]
*  That's what's scary. [[02:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9629.48s)]
*  That people taking advantage of bad situations. [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9631.08s)]
*  And, you know, if there's something breaks out in this country, [[02:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9634.4s)]
*  some kind of a war or something really scary, you have to be very careful of [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9637.32s)]
*  anybody whose solution is to take away your rights to protect you. [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9641.12s)]
*  You've got to be very careful of that because that's what tyrants do. [[02:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9644.76s)]
*  And they've always done things like that. [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9647.84s)]
*  Always. [[02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9649.64s)]
*  And they have all the information. [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9650.6s)]
*  Yeah. Well, that's the other thing that's crazy. [[02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9652.24s)]
*  They have all your data. [[02:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9654.08s)]
*  They have everything. [[02:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9655.16s)]
*  They have your geo tracking location. [[02:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9656.12s)]
*  They know where you are. [[02:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9658.28s)]
*  From the time you were a kid, for me, at least for me, [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9659.560000000001s)]
*  I think on your fucking iPhone can track you and you can decide to let your [[02:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9662.16s)]
*  friends track you, other people can track you, too. [[02:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9665.800000000001s)]
*  That's scary, man. [[02:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9668.6s)]
*  That's freaky. [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9670.6s)]
*  It's fucking freaky. [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9672.28s)]
*  I can't do it. I can't do it. [[02:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9673.32s)]
*  And every the Internet's weird. [[02:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9675.0s)]
*  It's all weird. [[02:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9677.44s)]
*  But so is this artificial intelligence thing that we're talking about. [[02:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9678.2s)]
*  And then this UFO thing. [[02:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9680.800000000001s)]
*  Like, why is that? [[02:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9682.24s)]
*  Why is that like in the mainstream discussion so frequently today? [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9683.560000000001s)]
*  You think it's a distraction from someone? [[02:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9687.560000000001s)]
*  I don't know, man. [[02:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9689.6s)]
*  Aliens are real, right? [[02:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9690.880000000001s)]
*  That was decided. [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9692.6s)]
*  I will listen. [[02:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9694.2s)]
*  I don't know. But I think it's very unlikely that we are the only [[02:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9695.720000000001s)]
*  consciousness in the universe, the only intelligent, conscious, [[02:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9701.28s)]
*  communicating being other than like whales and orcas. [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9704.6s)]
*  So if that's the case, so if there are things out there, [[02:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9708.24s)]
*  it's very likely there's going to be many more than we can even imagine. [[02:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9711.16s)]
*  And it's very likely they're going to be older than us. [[02:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9715.16s)]
*  So they probably have figured things out. [[02:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9717.560000000001s)]
*  And if they evolved in a stable atmosphere, in a place that doesn't have meteor [[02:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9719.640000000001s)]
*  showers slamming into it every few thousand years like Earth does, [[02:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9726.4s)]
*  maybe they got way further ahead of us very quickly. [[02:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9729.640000000001s)]
*  You know, maybe they didn't have to go through all the brutality. [[02:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9733.4s)]
*  Maybe they never had dinosaurs. [[02:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9735.52s)]
*  Maybe they didn't have to have an asteroid hit them to kill off the dinosaurs. [[02:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9737.36s)]
*  Maybe if maybe they were like small lizard intelligence that evolved [[02:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9740.68s)]
*  in a way more advanced and they're way more advanced, [[02:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9744.6s)]
*  like a million years, but did you see the court? [[02:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9746.76s)]
*  You saw the court case, right? [[02:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9748.72s)]
*  Yes. I'm very closely watching the guy being like, yeah, man, we got we got aliens [[02:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9750.039999999999s)]
*  in the back, bro. He definitely didn't say it like that. [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9754.64s)]
*  But he he said that there are reports that indicate that there are biological [[02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9756.76s)]
*  entities that have stored in freezers that are of alien. [[02:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9763.8s)]
*  Some, whether it's interdimensional or from another planet, something very different. [[02:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9768.039999999999s)]
*  And they have crashed vehicles, not just one, but many, [[02:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9772.599999999999s)]
*  as many as 12 crashed vehicles. [[02:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9776.08s)]
*  And then there is a UFO crash retrieval program. [[02:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9778.68s)]
*  And they believe that this program was probably what they used when they went [[02:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9782.52s)]
*  to Brazil and was it 96, the Varginha case that long ago. [[02:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9787.52s)]
*  There's a there's a case in 1996 that [[02:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9791.84s)]
*  James Fox did a great movie on called The Moment of Contact. [[02:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9795.0s)]
*  And The Moment of Contact is all about this one town in Brazil where everyone [[02:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9798.16s)]
*  was there when this UFO was over their city. [[02:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9802.36s)]
*  Like everyone was there evidently with the videos and things. [[02:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9804.92s)]
*  Well, there's a guy who died who carried the body to a car. [[02:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9808.04s)]
*  He carried the body to a car and they brought it to a hospital. [[02:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9812.24s)]
*  And the hospitals like, get that fucking thing out of here. [[02:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9814.4s)]
*  And they brought it to another hospital. [[02:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9816.0s)]
*  And they're like, this happened. Yes. [[02:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9817.28s)]
*  So that's all documented. [[02:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9819.4s)]
*  And then the guy who is a soldier who carried this alien being, [[02:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9820.84s)]
*  that guy died of a horrible bacterial infection that they couldn't cure. [[02:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9823.92s)]
*  They didn't know what the fuck it was. [[02:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9827.48s)]
*  He died really quickly. [[02:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9829.0s)]
*  Within two weeks, he was dead. [[02:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9830.16s)]
*  And he was a young fit guy. No way. [[02:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9831.48s)]
*  Yeah. So this scary they have a fucking giant like UFO monument in the middle [[02:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9833.720000000001s)]
*  of the city, like when you enter into the city in Virginia, there's a huge UFO there. [[02:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9840.28s)]
*  And James Fox is like he's filming all this and talking to these people. [[02:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9845.04s)]
*  This guy who was the police, he was a police officer that investigated [[02:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9849.48s)]
*  the crash when they brought him to the scene, they brought him to the woods, [[02:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9853.720000000001s)]
*  to the scene of where this thing supposedly crashed. [[02:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9857.36s)]
*  The guy breaks down, starts crying. [[02:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9859.6s)]
*  He's fucking weeping, weeping. [[02:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9861.28s)]
*  So either he's the greatest actor in the world. [[02:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9863.44s)]
*  Why was he weeping? Because he was there. [[02:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9866.32s)]
*  Because he remembered that that thing. [[02:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9867.84s)]
*  He remembered seeing that crash UFO. [[02:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9870.560000000001s)]
*  He remembers seeing this alien body and these girls, they talked to these two [[02:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9872.960000000001s)]
*  girls that ran into one of the things that was still alive. [[02:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9877.2s)]
*  And they described it. [[02:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9880.24s)]
*  There's an actual statue of it that we have in the studio or in the comedy club. [[02:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9881.960000000001s)]
*  Yo. And that's them today. [[02:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9887.76s)]
*  That's them when they were little girls. And that's them today. [[02:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9889.480000000001s)]
*  The whole town saw it, man. [[02:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9892.2s)]
*  The whole town. Like he kept interviewing people after people that talked about it, [[02:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9894.160000000002s)]
*  that were there. [[02:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9898.160000000002s)]
*  It's crazy. [[02:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9900.560000000001s)]
*  What's he describing that stick for? I wonder what that's about. [[02:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9901.560000000001s)]
*  I think he's probably describing the impact, how the thing slammed into the ground. [[02:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9903.2s)]
*  There was a crazy lightning storm, apparently. [[02:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9906.720000000001s)]
*  And this thing fell in the crazy lightning storm. [[02:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9909.92s)]
*  It got hit and disabled and crashed into the earth. [[02:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9913.68s)]
*  And apparently the Air Force sent something to retrieve it. [[02:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9917.52s)]
*  So the Air Force flew into Virginia, Brazil. [[02:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9921.76s)]
*  And that's all been documented by James Fox, too, that they did send a plane there [[02:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9924.4s)]
*  to go retrieve this thing. And now that this guy's come forward and then [[02:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9928.6s)]
*  the government is allowing him to say it. [[02:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9931.28s)]
*  I was about to ask. Yeah. [[02:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9932.92s)]
*  So the government is allowing this guy to say they have a retrieval project. [[02:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9934.04s)]
*  And this is all like they're allowing him to say these things. [[02:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9938.640000000001s)]
*  I wonder why. [[02:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9941.56s)]
*  Well, he only has to he only can stay within the lines. [[02:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9942.52s)]
*  Like and you saw that during the testimony, there was multiple questions. [[02:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9945.640000000001s)]
*  Yes, there's multiple questions they had where he said, I can't answer that. [[02:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9949.4s)]
*  I can answer it. What is it? [[02:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9952.44s)]
*  What is it called in a skiff? [[02:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9953.44s)]
*  That other set. [[02:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9954.8s)]
*  So a skiff is like the way I've been explained to me. [[02:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9955.64s)]
*  Make sure this is right. [[02:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9960.039999999999s)]
*  It's like a completely soundproof room that has no electronics. [[02:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9961.08s)]
*  OK, here it is. [[02:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9965.48s)]
*  A sensitive, compartmentalized information facility. [[02:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9966.44s)]
*  It's an ultra secure room where officials and government contractors take [[02:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9969.48s)]
*  extraordinary precautions to review highly classified information. [[02:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9973.36s)]
*  So they go into this like very, very protected room and then they'll break [[02:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9977.039999999999s)]
*  out these laptops and they'll break out these these photographs and videos [[02:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9981.16s)]
*  and they'll show them like what these things are. [[02:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9985.48s)]
*  They'll show the biological entities. [[02:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9988.839999999998s)]
*  They'll show them the crashed UFOs. [[02:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9991.56s)]
*  They'll show them the high resolution videos of these things hovering over [[02:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9994.199999999999s)]
*  military bases. They'll show them all the reports of them shutting down all the [[02:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=9998.839999999998s)]
*  nuclear systems. [[02:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10003.119999999999s)]
*  It's wild shit if it's true, but it doesn't feel true. [[02:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10005.0s)]
*  Why would it not feel true? [[02:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10009.800000000001s)]
*  I don't know, because maybe if aliens are real, maybe if this disclosure is so real, [[02:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10011.24s)]
*  maybe it's so mind blowing that it just feels like nonsense to me. [[02:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10015.68s)]
*  But something about it just feels a little fake. [[02:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10019.4s)]
*  You said that you said the UFO thing happened in 96. [[02:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10025.12s)]
*  I think the Virginia, Brazil one was 1996. [[02:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10027.72s)]
*  Yeah. If it's been around for that long, why is it just now? [[02:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10030.12s)]
*  Roswell, New Mexico was 1947. [[02:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10033.0s)]
*  The Roswell, New Mexico crash was on the front cover of the Roswell Daily Record. [[02:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10035.6s)]
*  I have it framed. [[02:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10040.08s)]
*  It's the front cover of the Roswell Daily Record. [[02:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10041.76s)]
*  They talk about a flying saucer that crashed in a ranch. [[02:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10044.52s)]
*  And so these people or these military people who were there reported initially, [[02:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10048.72s)]
*  who is the guy like pull up the Roswell story? [[02:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10054.68s)]
*  This is a crazy story. [[02:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10057.64s)]
*  So that that was on the front page of the Roswell Daily Record. [[02:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10059.84s)]
*  Our A.A.F. captures flying saucer on ranch in Roswell region. [[02:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10064.279999999999s)]
*  No details of flying disk are revealed. [[02:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10071.8s)]
*  And then they talk about the people who are involved. [[02:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10074.64s)]
*  It's really difficult to read the print in this image of it. [[02:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10077.519999999999s)]
*  Someone has to approve of this getting printed and things like that. [[02:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10080.439999999999s)]
*  So I feel like if this information. [[02:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10082.76s)]
*  The next day, then the next day, they said, oh, it was just a weather balloon. [[02:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10083.88s)]
*  Sorry, I made a mistake. [[02:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10087.439999999999s)]
*  And so they had this press conference where they posed with these pieces [[02:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10089.08s)]

*  The problem is all the eyewitnesses have a very different account. [[02:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10096.28s)]
*  They talk about this kind of metal that you could crumple up in your hand. [[02:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10100.76s)]
*  It was light as a paper. [[02:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10104.48s)]
*  And then you would open it would go right back to its original form. [[02:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10106.32s)]
*  They talk about these pieces of metal that were impossibly strong, [[02:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10110.8s)]
*  but impossibly light, and they had some kind of writing on them [[02:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10115.52s)]
*  that looked like Egyptian hieroglyphs or some kind of ancient right. [[02:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10118.56s)]
*  Some kind of symbols on it that they didn't know what the fuck they were. [[02:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10122.119999999999s)]
*  They looked very alien. [[02:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10125.48s)]
*  And they talk about biological entities [[02:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10126.88s)]
*  that were in the crash that they transported to this funeral home. [[02:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10129.24s)]
*  And there's this documentation of them making these small coffins. [[02:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10132.64s)]
*  And there's a lot of weird shit where [[02:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10136.8s)]
*  people that were there talked about seeing the bodies as multiple versions [[02:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10138.68s)]
*  of the same story. Now, it could be just nonsense. [[02:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10143.439999999999s)]
*  It could be like a folklore thing that people just started talking about. [[02:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10146.400000000001s)]
*  And everybody ran with it. [[02:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10149.960000000001s)]
*  And then it becomes like a tourist trap. [[02:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10151.400000000001s)]
*  Like people go to Roswell to, you know, the fucking. [[02:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10153.880000000001s)]
*  That'd be crazy. [[02:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10156.76s)]
*  They do economic boosters. [[02:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10157.640000000001s)]
*  It is an economic booster. [[02:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10159.04s)]
*  UFO freaks go to Roswell, New Mexico every year. [[02:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10160.560000000001s)]

*  think like when you used to watch about aliens, they'd be like, man, I saw the [[02:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10166.480000000001s)]
*  saucer in my backyard. You know what I mean? [[02:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10169.800000000001s)]
*  I hope so. Like in the future, you're just the guy on the video. [[02:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10172.24s)]
*  Not you either. [[02:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10175.12s)]
*  I'm just saying imagine if that is you. [[02:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10176.12s)]
*  Imagine if you're on tour and you guys are out in the middle of nowhere and you're [[02:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10178.560000000001s)]

*  There's a fucking UFO. [[02:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10186.6s)]
*  Just [[02:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10188.560000000001s)]
*  I've seen it. [[02:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10190.52s)]
*  You have taken shrooms. [[02:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10191.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10192.720000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[02:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10193.28s)]
*  Walked outside. [[02:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10193.880000000001s)]
*  I saw you saw UFO. [[02:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10194.84s)]
*  Probably really. [[02:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10195.960000000001s)]
*  You probably can't see him. [[02:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10196.92s)]
*  I know. [[02:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10198.08s)]
*  The shrooms reveal them. [[02:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10199.52s)]
*  No way. [[02:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10201.04s)]
*  Maybe. [[02:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10201.84s)]
*  Well, it might be. [[02:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10202.880000000001s)]
*  Getting more and more real now. [[02:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10204.2s)]
*  It's freaking me. [[02:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10205.4s)]
*  It might be more complicated than we're thinking. [[02:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10206.24s)]
*  Interstellar stuff. [[02:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10210.76s)]
*  Not just interstellar, but interdimensional. [[02:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10211.72s)]
*  And what does that really mean? [[02:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10214.52s)]
*  What does that mean? [[02:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10216.32s)]
*  And maybe there's certain times where we have access. [[02:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10217.279999999999s)]
*  We don't know how to do it like we can't just go there, [[02:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10222.68s)]
*  but maybe there's an opening and maybe they have access to us. [[02:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10226.68s)]
*  Maybe they can create these openings and just appear. [[02:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10230.88s)]
*  Maybe they're from something that is so different than what we're [[02:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10233.64s)]
*  experiencing here on Earth that we can't even understand what the fuck they're [[02:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10237.84s)]
*  talking. There might be a million years more advanced than us in a completely [[02:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10241.16s)]
*  different dimension and they figure out a way to visit and they can figure out a [[02:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10244.279999999999s)]
*  way to just show up and hover and move around things. [[02:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10248.439999999999s)]
*  Look, if we can send a probe to Mars and Elon can shoot a Tesla into space, [[02:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10252.4s)]
*  who the fuck knows what some insanely advanced civilization [[02:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10257.279999999999s)]
*  that has no war-like primate behavior like we do? [[02:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10263.36s)]
*  Maybe they've completely evolved past that. [[02:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10270.0s)]
*  Maybe they have no jealousy and rage and envy. [[02:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10272.88s)]
*  Maybe they've engineered negative emotions out and maybe they read minds. [[02:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10277.199999999999s)]
*  And maybe these things are just insanely advanced. [[02:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10281.48s)]
*  And it's their job to help usher in other [[02:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10284.4s)]
*  civilizations into the next stage of existence, which would be an existence [[02:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10288.0s)]
*  without war and violence, an existence where human beings sort of achieve almost [[02:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10292.48s)]
*  a hive mind that makes the whole God conversation crazy. [[02:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10298.439999999999s)]
*  Well, God might be the universe. [[02:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10302.96s)]
*  Instead of thinking that the universe created God, the universe might be God. [[02:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10305.6s)]
*  It might be conscious. [[02:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10311.359999999999s)]
*  The whole thing might be conscious. [[02:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10312.92s)]
*  Why not? When I look around, though, here's my thing. [[02:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10315.439999999999s)]
*  Sometimes when I'm like [[02:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10318.4s)]
*  running or like hiking or I'm on the lake or I'm playing a show and everyone's [[02:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10320.44s)]
*  singing back to me or I feel a certain way towards someone or whatever. [[02:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10324.76s)]
*  Those moments are like too grand and like beautiful to like not believe in God for me. [[02:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10330.76s)]
*  You know what I mean? You ever feel like that? [[02:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10336.0s)]
*  You ever been on a mountaintop and you're like, oh, man, this is crazy. [[02:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10337.36s)]
*  I believe in something. [[02:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10340.08s)]
*  I think the problem that people have is the word. [[02:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10342.12s)]
*  And when you say God, [[02:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10345.6s)]
*  people automatically think of this very [[02:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10347.36s)]
*  rigid, organized religion perspective that's based on ancient scripture. [[02:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10351.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's ruined it for a lot of people. [[02:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10356.320000000002s)]
*  Yeah, whether it's the God of, you know, whatever religion you choose to believe [[02:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10357.880000000001s)]
*  in, God is a bunch of different religions, a lot of them believe in God. [[02:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10363.0s)]
*  Right. But what if you don't want to think that there's something going on? [[02:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10366.320000000002s)]
*  Something like. [[02:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10373.320000000002s)]
*  Insanely complex, that's constantly moving, at least in our lives, [[02:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10375.16s)]
*  in our existence, constantly moving in this ever evolving direction. [[02:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10381.96s)]
*  Why? [[02:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10387.039999999999s)]
*  Is it possible that this is how the universe creates more universes and the [[02:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10389.8s)]
*  universe creates new things and these things become more and more advanced and [[02:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10396.519999999999s)]
*  everything continues to always advance, just like we were talking about it doing [[02:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10400.64s)]
*  with music and movies, maybe it's how it does it with planets. [[02:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10404.72s)]
*  Maybe it's how it does it with everything. [[02:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10408.599999999999s)]
*  Like things constantly get better and the beings get better at manipulating reality. [[02:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10410.279999999999s)]
*  They get better at creating black holes and being able to pass through wormholes [[02:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10416.599999999999s)]
*  and being able to manipulate space time. [[02:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10421.24s)]
*  How did you get to that perspective? [[02:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10425.8s)]
*  If you're from Boston and things like that, did you go up in the Catholic Church? [[02:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10427.519999999999s)]
*  Well, I was Catholic Church when I was a kid, did Catholic school for first grade. [[02:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10431.96s)]
*  But then, you know, we got out of it. [[02:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10437.16s)]
*  I was a horrible experience. Not good. [[02:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10440.08s)]
*  And then I kind of fell out of religion as a young kid because my Catholic school [[02:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10442.24s)]
*  experience was so bad, like a really mean nun who taught first grade. [[02:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10445.599999999999s)]
*  But it was also a good lesson that there's people like that in the world, [[02:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10449.84s)]
*  because I never met anybody like that before. [[02:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10452.8s)]
*  Religiously mean like about God and things like that? [[02:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10455.0s)]
*  Everybody in my life was nice to me. [[02:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10457.439999999999s)]
*  I was a little kid. Yeah. [[02:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10459.279999999999s)]
*  So everybody's nice to me. [[02:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10460.359999999999s)]

*  And then all of a sudden you're in this school where this nun is a cunt. [[02:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10463.88s)]
*  And I was like, oh, shut it. [[02:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10466.96s)]

*  Not if you did something wrong. [[02:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10474.68s)]
*  I experienced that. Every kid does. [[02:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10477.199999999999s)]
*  But mean to you like like corporal punishment, scaring you, telling you're going to. [[02:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10478.84s)]
*  Oh, yeah. She hit people. [[02:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10484.6s)]

*  Like religion and things was was so nice to me because I grew up like in a Baptist [[02:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10495.76s)]

*  It's weird. I've been around and I'm not saying [[02:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10506.28s)]
*  Catholicism is weird, but it's it is a weird. [[02:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10508.28s)]
*  There's a strictness to it that makes you feel unwelcomed. [[02:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10510.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10513.28s)]
*  And there's a lot of these priests they like to drink, which is insane. [[02:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10514.08s)]
*  They like to get fucked up. [[02:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10519.92s)]
*  This this priest gave gave my grandmother her, [[02:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10521.16s)]

*  And people had to correct them like her name was Josephine. [[02:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10528.72s)]
*  He was saying Geraldine left behind a great family. [[02:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10532.16s)]
*  He's like, Josephine, her name is Josephine. [[02:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10534.96s)]
*  He was just going through the motions. [[02:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10537.64s)]
*  And I remember seeing him before they started the thing and looking in his face [[02:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10539.56s)]
*  and thinking like this guy is drunk a lot like he had that those gin blossoms [[02:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10544.24s)]
*  all over his nose and his face like when he was just talking to people and everything. [[02:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10549.92s)]
*  When he was getting ready and setting up, I was looking at his face like, wow, [[02:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10554.24s)]
*  this guy looks super unhealthy. [[02:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10557.16s)]

*  I'm sure they're getting drunk. [[02:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10561.679999999998s)]
*  That's I mean, imagine it's not allowed. [[02:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10563.24s)]
*  Right. [[02:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10564.96s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10565.92s)]
*  Is it allowed? But imagine your occupation does not ever allow you to be in love. [[02:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10566.92s)]
*  That it makes me. [[02:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10571.64s)]
*  Did you see that Mark Wahlberg movie? [[02:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10572.96s)]

*  Where he like he gets paralyzed. [[02:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10575.56s)]
*  He gets paralyzed and he just wants to be a priest. [[02:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10578.56s)]

*  And he like falls in love with her. [[02:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10593.32s)]
*  I don't even remember what happens, but he gets paralyzed and things. [[02:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10595.08s)]
*  And I'm not going to ruin that movie either. [[02:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10597.56s)]
*  But it's OK. [[02:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10599.68s)]
*  Is it a new movie? I think so. [[02:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10600.439999999999s)]
*  Come out within the last year, I think. [[02:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10602.52s)]
*  So many movies out. It's impossible to keep up. [[02:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10604.72s)]
*  I got this crazy story. [[02:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10607.0s)]
*  I was in Chicago. [[02:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10608.08s)]
*  It involves like the church that I grew up in and things like that. [[02:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10609.56s)]
*  When I was a kid, like 13 and 14 years old, [[02:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10613.48s)]
*  we used to go on all these mission trips, like as a church. [[02:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10615.6s)]
*  And we used to go to Chicago to this place called Maywood. [[02:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10618.36s)]
*  And we would help all these kids out and run a VBS. [[02:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10620.6s)]
*  And there was nothing pretentious or weird about it. [[02:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10622.8s)]
*  We would just go and like play kickball with kids and like talk about God and Jesus [[02:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10624.36s)]
*  and things. [[02:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10628.32s)]
*  And it was this park in Chicago that we would always go to, like Maywood Park. [[02:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10629.72s)]
*  And it's kind of the rougher side of Chicago. [[02:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10634.0s)]
*  But like being a kid, I was naive to that. [[02:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10635.6s)]
*  So I didn't know. [[02:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10637.16s)]
*  So it's beautiful to think about that. [[02:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10637.8s)]
*  I had no idea that it was like the rougher part of town. [[02:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10639.08s)]
*  It was just fun for us. [[02:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10641.279999999999s)]
*  And [[02:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10642.84s)]
*  we went back to Chicago two weeks ago to play the Windy City Smokeout. [[02:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10644.48s)]
*  And I was there and I was there for three days. [[02:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10648.24s)]
*  So I didn't really have anything to do. [[02:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10649.8s)]
*  And one of the days I was off, I wanted to go to that park that I went to when I [[02:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10651.599999999999s)]
*  was 13. So it's been like 17 years or 15 years since I'd been there. [[02:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10655.92s)]
*  And I haven't talked to the pastors and things that I had. [[02:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10661.84s)]
*  Like we had pastors growing up. [[02:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10664.32s)]
*  I don't know about Catholicism, [[02:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10665.56s)]
*  but they're just called pastors, like the guys who are over you. [[02:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10666.76s)]
*  And [[02:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10669.800000000001s)]
*  on the way there, I had no idea where I was going. [[02:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10672.04s)]
*  I didn't even remember where this park was in Maywood, Chicago. [[02:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10673.92s)]
*  I didn't know where Maywood was. [[02:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10676.800000000001s)]
*  So I just typed in Maywood into the Uber app. [[02:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10678.08s)]
*  And my it was so beautiful, man, like the Uber started driving me out there [[02:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10680.68s)]
*  and I was riding out there and I was like, where is this park? [[02:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10685.0s)]
*  I have no idea. [[02:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10687.44s)]
*  And [[02:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10688.68s)]
*  there was the stories all over the place. [[02:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10690.2s)]
*  Sorry. But when we used to go on that mission trip, [[02:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10692.12s)]
*  Chicago had been flooded really terribly. [[02:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10694.640000000001s)]
*  And there was this lady named Miss Barnes, [[02:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10696.68s)]
*  who I had who I had like helped clean out her house when it flooded really bad. [[02:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10698.800000000001s)]
*  And she had written me letters while I was in the Navy, like all like letters [[02:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10702.880000000001s)]
*  throughout the years, and I would write her back and things like that. [[02:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10706.68s)]
*  And I would send them back and forth. [[02:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10709.04s)]
*  One day I sent her a letter and it was sent back to the sender because she had [[02:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10711.68s)]
*  passed away and I had known when I saw the the damn like back to send her thing. [[02:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10714.44s)]
*  So I'm on my way to this old church that we used to do these missions out of. [[02:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10720.800000000001s)]
*  And I'm calling my old youth pastors and I'm like, hey, where's this? [[02:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10723.52s)]
*  Where's this park at? Where's this church at? [[02:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10726.72s)]
*  And finally, I get in touch with this guy [[02:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10729.16s)]
*  named John, who lives in Maywood, and he sent me all the addresses to like the [[02:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10730.64s)]
*  park and the house and everything, and I go out there and it's been 15 years [[02:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10734.24s)]
*  and I'm sitting in this park and it's a Friday at like 6 p.m. [[02:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10739.16s)]
*  And when we used to go out there, they used to be just be all these kids [[02:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10742.52s)]
*  and things like that playing kickball and like in the basketball [[02:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10744.96s)]
*  in the basketball courts and at the park and like there was an American flag [[02:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10748.8s)]
*  hanging up and stuff and I went out there and there was nobody [[02:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10751.96s)]
*  and it was completely desolate. [[02:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10755.24s)]
*  It was five p.m. on a Friday in the summertime. [[02:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10756.8s)]
*  And I was just sitting on the I was sitting on the bleachers and I was looking [[02:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10759.48s)]
*  around, I was like, man, this has got to mean something. [[02:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10762.48s)]
*  It's got to mean something terrible or crazy. [[02:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10765.599999999999s)]
*  There are people just inside now. [[02:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10767.8s)]
*  People just hang out inside. [[02:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10769.519999999999s)]
*  And then I went to the house that she had lived in, Miss Barnes, [[02:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10771.359999999999s)]
*  the one that I had cleaned out from the flood and no one was there. [[02:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10774.199999999999s)]
*  And this John guy who I got in contact with had bought her house, [[02:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10778.16s)]
*  had purchased her house, like the mission guy. [[02:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10783.16s)]
*  And that's like those are the reasons why I believe in God, [[02:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10785.6s)]
*  because that was crazy. [[02:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10788.08s)]
*  Like I was driving out there and I had no idea where I was going, what I was doing. [[02:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10789.12s)]
*  And it turns out the guy I talked to was the guy who had purchased Miss Barnes [[02:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10793.32s)]
*  his house, who I had written letters to all those years. [[02:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10797.12s)]
*  And I'd been to that park and everything. [[03:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10800.96s)]
*  Men, you ever like go back to somewhere you like you spent time as a kid? [[03:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10803.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[03:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10806.76s)]
*  Isn't it weird? It's not freaky. It freaked me out a lot. [[03:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10807.48s)]
*  I was listening to music and I was walking around and I remembered like [[03:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10809.359999999999s)]
*  stepping in the same places was weird for me when I was so random. [[03:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10811.8s)]
*  It just reminded me of going to church and things like that. [[03:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10816.279999999999s)]
*  Not at all. [[03:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10817.84s)]
*  When I was a kid and I went back to my town where I grew up, [[03:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10818.8s)]
*  what was weird was like I had these memories [[03:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10821.84s)]
*  that were just basically like placeholder memories. [[03:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10824.96s)]
*  They were like. [[03:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10828.279999999999s)]
*  Like framework where I knew the specifics of stuff, [[03:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10830.279999999999s)]
*  but I didn't really have a memory of it until I went there. [[03:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10834.880000000001s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, like everything filled in. [[03:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10838.08s)]
*  That's what freaked me out. [[03:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10840.0s)]
*  I was at the house and things like that. [[03:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10841.0s)]
*  And I was walking around. I was like, oh, my God, I remember lifting this here. [[03:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10842.16s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[03:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10844.960000000001s)]

*  Yeah. It fills in. [[03:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10846.68s)]
*  That's like the nostalgia of all that shit is nuts, man. [[03:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10848.72s)]
*  I'm not even that I'm not even that old. [[03:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10851.92s)]
*  You know what I mean? I'm not like. [[03:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10854.12s)]
*  Yeah. But things from your childhood, like that's a long time ago. [[03:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10855.2s)]
*  When you think of how much different you are from when you were a kid. [[03:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10858.36s)]
*  That dimensionally freaks me out. [[03:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10861.76s)]
*  Yeah, it should. [[03:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10863.52s)]
*  I was talking about it last night, man. [[03:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10864.720000000001s)]
*  I was in this dude. [[03:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10865.960000000001s)]
*  I mean, I was in this fucking kiddie pool in this yard. [[03:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10867.0s)]
*  And I was like talking to someone about it. [[03:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10869.28s)]
*  I was like, the reality of then is the same as the reality of now. [[03:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10870.640000000001s)]
*  But it's also different and weird. [[03:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10873.960000000001s)]
*  That's got to be some weird dimensional thing, man, where it's like that existed, too. [[03:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10875.800000000001s)]
*  Each day is the same. [[03:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10880.76s)]
*  Yeah. And you think about it. [[03:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10882.04s)]
*  And like, is your nostalgia like a fucking. [[03:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10883.32s)]
*  What are your memories, man? [[03:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10886.76s)]
*  Like, what is this? [[03:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10888.0s)]
*  Like, how does that mean less than the present? [[03:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10889.04s)]
*  Well, they're definitely shaky. [[03:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10891.84s)]
*  You know, we all know our memories are shaky. [[03:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10894.08s)]
*  Unless even if things like your songs, like stuff you wrote, like you have to [[03:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10895.84s)]
*  concentrate on them, right? [[03:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10899.08s)]
*  You wrote them. [[03:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10900.16s)]
*  And sometimes you can forget the words. [[03:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10901.359999999999s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[03:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10902.88s)]
*  Like memories weird and memory of like specific things from the past is always [[03:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10903.48s)]
*  slippery until you're there again. [[03:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10910.4s)]
*  You're like, oh, it really freaked me out. [[03:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10912.599999999999s)]
*  It really freaked me out to be sitting there. [[03:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10914.84s)]
*  I remember like my dad with hair and shit. [[03:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10916.64s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[03:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10919.119999999999s)]
*  And it was like I called my dad when I was there and I was like, man, this is nuts. [[03:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10919.92s)]
*  Like, do you remember your friends when they were in high school and they see them [[03:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10923.519999999999s)]
*  now and they're all grown up and you're like, what the fuck? [[03:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10926.039999999999s)]

*  You're like, wait, this came out of you. [[03:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10930.08s)]
*  What's going on? [[03:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10931.64s)]
*  I remember you throwing a tequila bottle at Coach Craig's. [[03:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10932.16s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[03:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10934.64s)]

*  This is wild. [[03:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10942.039999999999s)]
*  And. [[03:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10943.279999999999s)]
*  Damn, it's fascinating. [[03:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10945.92s)]
*  It's becoming an adult human being is fascinating. [[03:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10947.76s)]
*  And then as you're becoming an adult human [[03:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10951.199999999999s)]
*  being, more and more other people are becoming adult human beings. [[03:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10953.24s)]
*  They have a different way of living their life than you do. [[03:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10955.96s)]
*  And that's why like every generation [[03:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10958.64s)]
*  looks at the new generation, all these fucking kids today. [[03:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10960.199999999999s)]
*  But everyone says it and I've been feeling it so vividly. [[03:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10963.039999999999s)]
*  What scares me the most about growing up is having songs. [[03:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10966.199999999999s)]
*  It's got to freak you out, too, about having podcasts. [[03:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10969.439999999999s)]
*  Do you ever feel like you're going to look like having all these songs from the time [[03:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10972.119999999999s)]
*  I was 22 to now? [[03:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10974.84s)]
*  Sometimes I'm like, I've made peace with it. [[03:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10977.24s)]
*  It's just what I do. [[03:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10979.48s)]
*  I have conversations with people that my kids are going to hear one day. [[03:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10981.08s)]
*  Like my kids listen to my podcast for specific ones, [[03:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10984.24s)]
*  especially people that they like on it, artists that they like. [[03:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10988.039999999999s)]
*  They'll listen to this one. [[03:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10990.8s)]
*  Like your most vulnerable moments, you know, your kids. [[03:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10992.24s)]
*  Yeah, that's beautiful. [[03:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10995.0s)]
*  That's cool. It's, you know, we're fucking talking about aliens, man. [[03:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=10997.039999999999s)]
*  It's crazy. Well, sorry to your kids. [[03:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=11000.439999999999s)]
*  That's a fascinating thing to talk about. [[03:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=11002.359999999999s)]
*  Kids talk about it, too. [[03:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=11004.4s)]
*  Everybody does. [[03:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=11005.88s)]
*  It's one of those things where it's like, if it's true, it's real. [[03:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=11007.24s)]
*  The whole map that we have of reality is very different now. [[03:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=11010.2s)]
*  These things really are visiting and they really are these super sophisticated [[03:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=11013.88s)]
*  creatures that have been here from the beginning. [[03:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=11017.8s)]
*  They have been around as long as the Earth's been around. [[03:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=11020.039999999999s)]
*  They've been visiting and checking in on us. [[03:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=11023.08s)]
*  It'll change. [[03:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=11025.68s)]
*  It'll change the trajectory of the entire universe. [[03:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=11026.68s)]
*  Like, you know, it'll like that's why I brought God up earlier. [[03:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=11029.039999999999s)]
*  And so I went into that fucking Chicago story. [[03:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=11031.2s)]
*  But like, it'll change how people have lived their lives for the last 600 years, [[03:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=11032.84s)]
*  which is scary, man. [[03:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=11037.359999999999s)]
*  That's got to do something terrible. [[03:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=11038.279999999999s)]
*  Is it though? Is it scary or is it good? [[03:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=11040.32s)]
*  Is it just evolution? Or is it just is? [[03:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=11042.439999999999s)]
*  Is it just is? [[03:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=11044.48s)]
*  It just is life. This is life. [[03:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=11045.64s)]
*  This is what it is. [[03:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=11047.439999999999s)]
*  Like you can just decide you wish we were living in 1967 when you had a fucking [[03:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=11048.519999999999s)]

*  I do it when I want to clear my thoughts. [[03:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=11061.6s)]
*  I do it in the sauna because it's a good way to concentrate while I'm cooking myself. [[03:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=11063.560000000001s)]

*  Isn't that what meditating is? [[03:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=11073.68s)]
*  It's like everything is coming and going. [[03:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=11074.880000000001s)]
*  For some people, for some people, it's just a chance at stillness or attempt at [[03:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=11076.560000000001s)]
*  stillness, you know, but. [[03:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=11080.36s)]

*  I think that was like an ancient curse. [[03:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=11101.960000000001s)]
*  People have had to have talked about this forever, though. [[03:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=11104.16s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[03:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=11107.16s)]
*  Like forever, you know, like that's why I get freaked out by conversations like this. [[03:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=11107.64s)]
*  I'm like, man, are we just... [[03:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=11110.64s)]
*  No, because this is a different time. [[03:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=11111.68s)]
*  I mean, this is a time where you're having congressional disclosure. [[03:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=11113.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGYcAuVR7Bc&t=11116.36s)]
