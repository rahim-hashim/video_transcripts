**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day! [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6.0s)]
*  I was already smoking it! [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=30.0s)]
*  I didn't bully you into smoking it, dude. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=32.0s)]
*  You can't bully me when I'm already doing it! [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=34.0s)]
*  He's bullying and he's not doing it. He bullied him and he didn't do it. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=36.0s)]
*  Shane is the king of that. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=38.0s)]
*  Here's my only impression of Shane. You won't. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=42.0s)]
*  Yeah, you won't do that. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=44.0s)]
*  Whatever's brought up, you won't. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=46.0s)]
*  You have my favorite childish humor. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=48.0s)]
*  It's so fun! [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=50.0s)]
*  And it works, too. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=52.0s)]
*  Grab your friend and you go, you won't do that, dude? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=54.0s)]
*  It's very funny to be childish. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=56.0s)]
*  He's dumb. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=58.0s)]
*  Give me that shit, I'll do it right now! [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=60.0s)]
*  I'll cut myself. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=62.0s)]
*  He's jet lagged, he came from another country. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=64.0s)]
*  I can't believe you're doing this. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=66.0s)]
*  Yeah, I had an Athens fucking five hours. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=68.0s)]
*  Did you go see the Acropolis? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=70.0s)]
*  I did. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=72.0s)]
*  It's so cool. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=74.0s)]
*  What's Acropolis? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=76.0s)]
*  It's like a bunch of fucking rubble. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=78.0s)]
*  The Acropolis is the base, the Parthenon is the building, correct? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=80.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=84.0s)]
*  I looked up that a bunch of times when I was there and I still don't know. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=86.0s)]
*  Nobody knows. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=88.0s)]
*  No idea. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=90.0s)]
*  Yeah, the Acropolis is the building, the Parthenon is what it's built on. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=92.0s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=96.0s)]
*  The Greeks were gay. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=98.0s)]
*  Okay, the Acropolis of Athens is an ancient citadel located in a rocky outcrop. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=100.0s)]
*  Which one is the Acropolis and which one is the Parthenon? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=106.0s)]
*  I think the... [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=110.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, I don't know. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=112.0s)]
*  The Acropolis is the building and the Parthenon is what it's built on. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=114.0s)]
*  The most famous being the Parthenon. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=118.0s)]
*  The Acropolis is I think the entire thing and the Parthenon is one of the buildings. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=120.0s)]
*  But what's the structure that it sits on? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=122.0s)]
*  What's the Parthenon? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=124.0s)]
*  Google that. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=126.0s)]
*  That's that one. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=128.0s)]
*  That's under construction. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=130.0s)]
*  So the Parthenon is the building, the Acropolis... [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=132.0s)]
*  They build it back up, they rise all the way up. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=134.0s)]
*  There's scaffolding everywhere. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=136.0s)]
*  The roof fell off. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=138.0s)]
*  The centerpiece. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=140.0s)]
*  So, okay, the Parthenon is a former temple of the Athenian Acropolis Greece that was dedicated to the goddess Athena during the 5th century BC. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=142.0s)]
*  All those people were tripping balls, you know. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=152.0s)]
*  Goddess of Beauty. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=154.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's a great book on it. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=156.0s)]
*  The Immortality Key by this guy Brian Meriorescu. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=158.0s)]
*  It actually opened up a field of study at Harvard. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=160.0s)]
*  This guy wrote a book about how they did... [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=162.0s)]
*  They always suspected that their wine was laced with something. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=166.0s)]
*  They got definitive proof because they found old vessels and they tested these vessels and they found ergot in them. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=170.0s)]
*  Which is a fungus that has LSD-like effects. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=176.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=180.0s)]
*  So they made up that they were gods? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=182.0s)]
*  That must have fucked them up. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=184.0s)]
*  That's where they came up with everything. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=186.0s)]
*  They came up with democracy, they came up with so much from tripping balls. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=188.0s)]
*  It makes sense. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=190.0s)]
*  He hit this rock and it became a spring. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=192.0s)]
*  To fight him he hit a rock and it became a tree. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=194.0s)]
*  All those old people were tripping balls. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=196.0s)]
*  The problem was hiding it from the Romans and they had to move away. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=198.0s)]
*  They started going into other countries when they got kicked out of Greece. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=202.0s)]
*  They moved the Illucinian mysteries all over the world. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=206.0s)]
*  The what mysteries? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=208.0s)]
*  Illusus. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=210.0s)]
*  Illucidian mysteries. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=212.0s)]
*  All the zoo stuff? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=214.0s)]
*  All the trip ball stuff. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=216.0s)]
*  People like scholars from all over the world would go there and participate in these rituals. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=218.0s)]
*  They would just trip their fucking brains out and figure things out. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=224.0s)]
*  How about those grape leaves? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=228.0s)]
*  I don't think that had anything to do with it. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=230.0s)]
*  Those are just leaves. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=232.0s)]
*  They're not great. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=234.0s)]
*  They're not great. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=236.0s)]
*  They overrated. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=238.0s)]
*  They got a dip into Zika to make it edible. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=240.0s)]
*  They're pretty bland. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=242.0s)]
*  They got the same food as Middle Eastern. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=244.0s)]
*  A lot of pita, kebab, hummus. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=246.0s)]
*  Or as David Tell calls it, terrorist peanut butter. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=248.0s)]
*  His joke. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=252.0s)]
*  Did you have fun? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=254.0s)]
*  Did you have a good time? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=256.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=258.0s)]
*  Athens is a cool city. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=260.0s)]
*  Did you get away from the tour? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=262.0s)]
*  I did get to walk and hike. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=264.0s)]
*  It's a big national park in the middle. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=266.0s)]
*  It's like Central Park. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=268.0s)]
*  Parks are a park though. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=270.0s)]
*  You like to hike? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=272.0s)]
*  Did you protect those parks in Athens? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=274.0s)]
*  People have asked me about the parks. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=276.0s)]
*  Yeah, everyone you try to protect is a park. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=278.0s)]
*  Yeah, everyone you try to protect goes away. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=280.0s)]
*  I saw one somewhere, like if you protect any parks lately. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=282.0s)]
*  And I was like, no, I only failed in protecting any parks. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=284.0s)]
*  Well, you only tried one. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=286.0s)]
*  Yeah, utter failure. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=288.0s)]
*  But sometimes it's your first time trying to protect a park. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=290.0s)]
*  True. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=292.0s)]
*  Why do you like parks? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=294.0s)]
*  Because he's a city dork. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=296.0s)]
*  He's the only nature he gets. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=298.0s)]
*  They stink. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=300.0s)]
*  I took my nephew to a park. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=302.0s)]
*  I just looked like a pedophile the whole time. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=304.0s)]
*  He was in one of the little tiny parks with a swing set. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=306.0s)]
*  Yeah, I just took him to a park. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=308.0s)]
*  I was just yelling at him. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=310.0s)]
*  You're not allowed to go without a kid. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=312.0s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of these places. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=314.0s)]
*  That's weird. Going to a park and just watching kids. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=316.0s)]
*  Boy, I love watching kids interact. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=318.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=320.0s)]
*  You can't. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=322.0s)]
*  So innocent. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=324.0s)]
*  You have to go with your own kid. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=326.0s)]
*  Dog parks you can't go in without a dog. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=328.0s)]
*  They won't stop you, but the rule is you can't go in without a dog. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=330.0s)]
*  Oh really? Is that the rule? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=332.0s)]
*  Is it written? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=334.0s)]
*  It's told. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=336.0s)]
*  That's the only way I know it. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=338.0s)]
*  My nieces and nephews are black. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=340.0s)]
*  My dad took him to the park by himself. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=342.0s)]
*  My niece was on the swings. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=344.0s)]
*  She was like, slap me, Pappy. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=346.0s)]
*  He was down there pushing her ass. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=348.0s)]
*  Pretty funny, right? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=350.0s)]
*  People were looking at it like, what the fuck is going on here? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=352.0s)]
*  Slap me, Pappy. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=354.0s)]
*  She was like, slap it, Pappy. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=356.0s)]
*  He was like, Jesus Christ. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=358.0s)]
*  I can see there's a playground outside my apartment. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=360.0s)]
*  Mom was on her phone the whole time. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=362.0s)]
*  Pushing this kid on a swing. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=364.0s)]
*  It killed me. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=366.0s)]
*  You can so easily steal a kid. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=368.0s)]
*  They're all so distracted. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=370.0s)]
*  Now's the time. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=372.0s)]
*  My friend almost got his kid stolen from a park. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=374.0s)]
*  What? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=376.0s)]
*  He noticed at the last minute that someone was calling his kid towards a truck. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=378.0s)]
*  Brian Laundrie. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=382.0s)]
*  He stopped it. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=384.0s)]
*  He ran out and stopped it, but I think he was just not paying attention for a brief period of time. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=386.0s)]
*  Somebody tried to steal his kid. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=390.0s)]
*  I got hit on by a pedophile as a youth. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=392.0s)]
*  The thing is, it does happen. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=394.0s)]
*  It sounds so insane. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=396.0s)]
*  It actually does happen. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=398.0s)]
*  People steal children. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=400.0s)]
*  That kid will forget. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=402.0s)]
*  That kid will forget. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=404.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ, what a horrible thought. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=406.0s)]
*  Remember milk carton kids? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=408.0s)]
*  That was a big thing. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=410.0s)]
*  I think a lot of them are stolen by the parent. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=412.0s)]
*  That's almost all the stats of abducted kids. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=414.0s)]
*  People use their kids as leverage to get back at the spouse. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=416.0s)]
*  The husband and the wife get divorced and the wife won't let the husband see the kid. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=420.0s)]
*  He yells at her, I want my fucking kids. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=424.0s)]
*  You won't let that whore in the house with her. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=426.0s)]
*  That would be nice getting so hammered and just going to your fucking ex-wife's house. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=428.0s)]
*  I'm just going to see my fucking son, you bitch. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=432.0s)]
*  Tell him to get shot. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=436.0s)]
*  Daddy, no. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=438.0s)]
*  There's a horrible video of a guy getting shot doing that. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=440.0s)]
*  Oh really? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=442.0s)]
*  He goes to the house where his kid lives and there's a guy there and the guy and the wife are there. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=444.0s)]
*  He's yelling and the guy's getting off my fucking property. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=448.0s)]
*  The guy's a big guy and he gets in his face and the guy goes and gets an AR. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=452.0s)]
*  They struggle with the AR. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=456.0s)]
*  They struggle with the gun briefly and the guy lights him up. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=458.0s)]
*  That's a good dad. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=462.0s)]
*  He lights him up in front of the guy's mom. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=464.0s)]
*  Who's also there. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=466.0s)]
*  Wait, who shot who? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=468.0s)]
*  The biological father got shot by the stepdad? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=470.0s)]
*  Yes, the stepdad. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=472.0s)]
*  He got cocked. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=474.0s)]
*  The biological dad is a smaller guy. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=476.0s)]
*  The biological dad is a big guy. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=478.0s)]
*  Why would you get close enough with an AR from some other guy to grab it? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=480.0s)]
*  I think he was just trying to threaten him. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=482.0s)]
*  If he pulled out a gun, the guy would be like, that's it. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=484.0s)]
*  Okay, he got a gun. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=486.0s)]
*  I'm going to leave now. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=488.0s)]
*  But this guy was an idiot. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=490.0s)]
*  I've seen quite a few of those people. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=492.0s)]
*  People get nutty and they don't understand risk and they don't understand danger. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=494.0s)]
*  Even just with fights. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=498.0s)]
*  When they get in people's face, yeah man, fuck you. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=500.0s)]
*  Do something then. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=502.0s)]
*  You really don't know how to fight. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=504.0s)]
*  You're about to engage in one of the most dangerous things that people can do other than using weapons. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=506.0s)]
*  It happens all the time. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=510.0s)]
*  I saw a video the other day of this guy in front of a truck. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=512.0s)]
*  This guy is yelling, come on pussy, fight like a man. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=516.0s)]
*  He takes his shirt off and the guy just shoots him. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=518.0s)]
*  I didn't see that one. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=520.0s)]
*  I saw that one. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=522.0s)]
*  The guy just shoots him. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=524.0s)]
*  The guy's got a gun out and he's like, stop. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=526.0s)]
*  The guy's like, come on pussy. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=528.0s)]
*  He takes his shirt off while the guy has a gun out. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=530.0s)]
*  Boom. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=532.0s)]
*  The guy goes down screaming. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=534.0s)]
*  The guy died. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=536.0s)]
*  What happened? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=538.0s)]
*  He had a whip or something. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=540.0s)]
*  No, he had a sword. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=542.0s)]
*  That was supposedly like, wasn't supposed to happen. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=544.0s)]
*  It was like an ad lib. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=548.0s)]
*  He was high all the time. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=550.0s)]

*  He seems depressed. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=558.0s)]
*  You can't control this. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=560.0s)]
*  He knows what he does. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=562.0s)]
*  It's so out of control and it's so not what you grew up with. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=564.0s)]
*  What's the kids these days? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=566.0s)]

*  That One World Theater was built by a cult [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=708.0s)]
*  so that their leader could dance in front of them. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=710.0s)]
*  Literally. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=712.0s)]
*  They put on these performances. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=714.0s)]
*  They documented it all. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=716.0s)]
*  This guy filmed everything. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=718.0s)]

*  That's his older self. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=724.0s)]
*  You see him when he was young? [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=726.0s)]
*  He was already getting old then. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=728.0s)]
*  You see the videos of him when he was young? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=730.0s)]
*  He was a beautiful man. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=732.0s)]
*  He was this really gorgeous ripped yoga instructor. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=734.0s)]
*  He started this cult in West Hollywood [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=736.0s)]
*  called the Buddha Field. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=738.0s)]
*  And then they moved it out to Austin. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=740.0s)]
*  They're all praying. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=742.0s)]
*  Let me see the penises. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=744.0s)]
*  The pouches. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=746.0s)]
*  Down, down. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=748.0s)]
*  They wouldn't let the lady get close. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=750.0s)]
*  You'd be lower. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=752.0s)]
*  It's like a fucking Bud Light commercial. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=754.0s)]
*  He had these boys with him. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=756.0s)]
*  He fucked all of them. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=758.0s)]
*  He's not gay? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=760.0s)]
*  He was a gay porn star. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=762.0s)]
*  He had girls in there too. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=764.0s)]
*  I think girls is how he got straight guys [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=766.0s)]
*  to come to the cult. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=768.0s)]
*  Because he fucked all the straight guys. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=770.0s)]
*  He convinced them? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=772.0s)]
*  She watched the documentary. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=774.0s)]
*  He was a hypnotist. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=776.0s)]
*  He was a hypnotist. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=778.0s)]
*  He gave them therapy and then he'd fuck them. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=780.0s)]
*  He charged them for the therapy. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=782.0s)]
*  And he owned the mothership? [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=784.0s)]
*  No, he owned the One World Theater. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=786.0s)]
*  The people I was buying it from [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=788.0s)]
*  were people that used to be in the cult. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=790.0s)]
*  Now they owned it. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=792.0s)]
*  But that was the original location for it. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=794.0s)]
*  That's wild. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=796.0s)]
*  I love it. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=798.0s)]
*  I was watching that Korean guy [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=800.0s)]
*  and he had 900 women as cheerleaders. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=802.0s)]
*  The stadium would be packed [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=804.0s)]
*  and he'd score 80 goals. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=806.0s)]
*  People were like, we gotta arrest this son of a bitch. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=808.0s)]
*  This guy is dominating. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=810.0s)]
*  He rules. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=812.0s)]
*  Did they kill him? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=814.0s)]
*  They captured him in the end. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=816.0s)]
*  He's in a tent with two girls. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=818.0s)]
*  They're like, what are you doing back here? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=820.0s)]
*  He's got a boner. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=822.0s)]
*  He's like, stay out. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=824.0s)]
*  It goes from 90 goals scoring [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=826.0s)]
*  to being in a tent with two girls. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=828.0s)]
*  The last ones. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=830.0s)]
*  It was tough. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=832.0s)]
*  Still had that fucking three-way in a tent. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=834.0s)]
*  It was pretty awesome. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=836.0s)]
*  Which he dominated. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=838.0s)]
*  You gotta see his soccer. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=840.0s)]
*  They would line up like 15 people in the goal [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=842.0s)]
*  and he'd be like, I can still score on them. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=844.0s)]
*  They would all get out of the way. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=846.0s)]
*  Isn't it wild that everybody knows about cults [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=848.0s)]
*  but yet people can still form cults [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=850.0s)]
*  and get people to join them? [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=852.0s)]
*  I want to go in for a week and just see if they'd get me. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=854.0s)]
*  Knowing to any cult. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=856.0s)]
*  Just knowing. I know what this is but let me see if they'd get me. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=858.0s)]
*  You escaped Judaism. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=860.0s)]
*  Cut to you getting fucked in the ass. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=862.0s)]
*  Two days later in a tent. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=864.0s)]
*  It happened quick man. They made some good points. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=866.0s)]
*  You were like a serious orthodox Jew. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=868.0s)]
*  If you got out of that. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=870.0s)]
*  Which is like a respected cult. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=872.0s)]
*  It's a respected one. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=874.0s)]
*  Cult 45. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=876.0s)]
*  I was in for a while. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=878.0s)]
*  I might get out of this too. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=880.0s)]
*  Indianapolis cult? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=882.0s)]
*  Low protein diet? [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=884.0s)]
*  That's the question. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=886.0s)]
*  When does it become a cult? [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=888.0s)]
*  Is Christianity a cult? [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=890.0s)]
*  Is Catholicism a cult? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=892.0s)]
*  They're all cults. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=894.0s)]
*  What makes a cult versus religion? [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=896.0s)]
*  You're not watching some Korean guy fuck everybody [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=898.0s)]
*  and score 70 cults. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=900.0s)]
*  Do you want to have a priest fuck a lot of boys? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=902.0s)]
*  But that's why they didn't last. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=904.0s)]
*  They went too hard. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=906.0s)]
*  Tell that to the Catholics. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=908.0s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. That's a good cult. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=910.0s)]
*  They figured it out. Good marketing. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=912.0s)]
*  They figured out how to make the Vatican a country. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=914.0s)]
*  It's the wildest shit ever. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=916.0s)]
*  100 acre. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=918.0s)]
*  You got a 100 acre country in the middle of your city. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=920.0s)]
*  It's very nice. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=922.0s)]
*  There's a difference between a town and a city. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=924.0s)]
*  The cult is the people that can't keep it together [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=926.0s)]
*  and the guy fucks everyone's wife. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=928.0s)]
*  The religions, they just... [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=930.0s)]

*  He peeped a hole and videotaped him. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=942.0s)]
*  There's a ritual bath? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=944.0s)]
*  To get clean? [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=946.0s)]
*  That was the part I was skipping over. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=948.0s)]
*  Those New York Jews got to take a couple more ritual baths. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=950.0s)]
*  That's true. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=954.0s)]

*  I agree with Jesus. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1010.0s)]
*  Jesus told you that? [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1012.0s)]
*  I can't argue with Jesus. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1014.0s)]

*  The wildest was the Mormons. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1032.0s)]
*  It was just guys trying to fuck Catholic chicks. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1034.0s)]
*  Catholic chicks trying to get fucked. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1036.0s)]
*  The Mormons are the docking. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1038.0s)]
*  That's the best one. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1040.0s)]
*  Stick it in, soak it, then leave it in. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1042.0s)]
*  Docking is way better. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1044.0s)]
*  Docking is foreskin. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1046.0s)]
*  I wonder who gets to choose who's the top foreskin. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1048.0s)]
*  That's a good question. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1050.0s)]
*  You should rock paper scissors for that. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1052.0s)]
*  Sword fight. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1054.0s)]
*  You'd rather be the small spoon. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1056.0s)]
*  You'd rather be inside. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1058.0s)]
*  It feels better. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1060.0s)]
*  Yeah, it would feel better. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1062.0s)]
*  It's more dark. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1064.0s)]
*  It's more dominant to have your skin around. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1066.0s)]
*  It is more dominant. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1068.0s)]
*  It's strictly the feel. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1070.0s)]
*  It's also so ridiculous. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1072.0s)]
*  Do that, you fucking weirdo. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1074.0s)]
*  Then you just stare at each other. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1076.0s)]
*  What are you doing, bro? [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1078.0s)]
*  I'm fucking your dick. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1080.0s)]
*  You're not wrapping your dick around my dick. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1082.0s)]
*  I'm sucking in your dick. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1084.0s)]

*  I think I'm sucking in your dick. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1090.0s)]
*  You might be sucking my dick, but I'm fucking your dick. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1092.0s)]
*  I'm definitely sucking your dick. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1094.0s)]
*  It's like when I fuck your mouth. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1096.0s)]
*  You might be sucking my dick, but I'm fucking your mouth. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1098.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1100.0s)]
*  Stop that clip. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1102.0s)]
*  The worst part about docking is you have to be face to face. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1106.0s)]
*  Face to face is crazy. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1108.0s)]
*  You're like an inch away from being the best part. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1110.0s)]

*  This hacker was talking. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1120.0s)]
*  I said to the hacker, hey, if you don't shut the fuck up, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1122.0s)]
*  I'm going to have Dan Henderson hold you down [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1124.0s)]

*  Wow. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1142.0s)]
*  If a guy took one step forward, he's like, hey, stop fucking my wife. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1144.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1146.0s)]
*  Dan Henderson is a fucking animal. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1148.0s)]
*  Just the fact that he could come up with that on the fly. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1150.0s)]

*  He said that before. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1156.0s)]
*  Why would I hold him down when I could just stare him down? [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1158.0s)]
*  That's terrifying. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1160.0s)]
*  The wife is like, alright, let's do this. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1162.0s)]
*  It was a joke, bro. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1164.0s)]
*  Was the heckler even that bad? [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1166.0s)]

*  Wait a minute. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1202.0s)]
*  Not Stern, but their group was like, take that shit down. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1204.0s)]
*  They didn't want them succeeding. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1206.0s)]
*  And then they were like, if this happens all the time, we'll just have to file a thing that will get put back up. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1208.0s)]
*  So they were saying that it was offensive? [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1210.0s)]
*  That's how they got it taken down? [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1212.0s)]
*  Maybe they were the ones, they were like, no, we're the edgy. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1214.0s)]
*  We should say that it was, we know that's true. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1216.0s)]
*  We need to find out, because that's such a fucking egregious, evil thing to do. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1218.0s)]
*  If you're in that business, say something's offensive. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1220.0s)]
*  Like saying, Don, I must not do far. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1222.0s)]
*  He got fucked. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1224.0s)]
*  He'd be like, I'm the offensive one, no one else. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1226.0s)]
*  Well, we're not going to do that. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1228.0s)]
*  We're not going to do that. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1230.0s)]
*  We're not going to do that. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1232.0s)]
*  What else? [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1234.0s)]
*  Well, when he silenced Opie and Anthony, he wouldn't let them talk shit about him. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1236.0s)]
*  Well, he was talking shit about them. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1238.0s)]
*  Wild. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1240.0s)]

*  Don't you stand for anything, though? [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1246.0s)]
*  You're a fucking radio guy? [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1248.0s)]
*  Yeah, I thought you were a radio guy. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1250.0s)]
*  I think that guy was alone on the front line for so long. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1252.0s)]
*  Imagine if it's World War II, and it's just you against the Japanese, and you're on this fucking island, just killing people every day for like, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1256.0s)]

*  I don't think that's true. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1276.0s)]
*  Don? [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1278.0s)]
*  I think that is people that work for him. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1280.0s)]
*  Tell him, don't look at him, don't talk to him. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1282.0s)]
*  And so, he probably doesn't even know that they're doing that. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1284.0s)]
*  I know that happens with some stars. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1286.0s)]

*  You're like, this is a clean bet, and then halfway in you're like, oh it does go to anal. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1358.0s)]
*  In the end. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1360.0s)]
*  Damn, fuck. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1362.0s)]
*  How can I re-aim this? [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1364.0s)]
*  I never had to do one. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1366.0s)]
*  Clean show? [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1368.0s)]
*  I don't think ever. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1370.0s)]
*  The guy said no every single time. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1372.0s)]
*  They don't exist anymore. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1374.0s)]
*  I never had to do late night or anything. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1376.0s)]
*  When I was coming up, it was like, do you want money or not? [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1378.0s)]
*  Do you want food or not? [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1382.0s)]
*  It's like, if you want to get that 100 bucks, you gotta go do that clean show. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1384.0s)]
*  That's a good exercise. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1388.0s)]
*  To think about the language for the first time in your life, in a decade, is this dirty? [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1390.0s)]
*  It wasn't a decade for me, but it was early days of stand up. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1396.0s)]
*  The thing is, back then, they really wanted stand up to be clean. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1400.0s)]
*  Everybody wanted you to work clean because that's how you got on The Tonight Show. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1404.0s)]
*  Once Steven Wright got on The Tonight Show out of Boston, it kind of changed how everybody thought about comedy. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1408.0s)]
*  Everybody was like, you're gonna get on The Tonight Show now. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1414.0s)]
*  You gotta work clean. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1416.0s)]
*  If you want to make it, you gotta work clean. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1418.0s)]
*  I remember there's a bunch of guys that were just in town. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1420.0s)]
*  We're telling them, if you want to work, you gotta work clean. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1422.0s)]
*  You're just here. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1424.0s)]
*  We were talking about it last night. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1426.0s)]
*  I gotta get my stuff together for a late night spot. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1428.0s)]
*  It's like, dude, what? [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1432.0s)]
*  Late night's over. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1434.0s)]
*  It's kind of a fun thing. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1436.0s)]
*  No, don't get me wrong. It would be cool to do, but I'm saying there's guys that are like, here's my way out. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1438.0s)]
*  It doesn't launch anybody anymore. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1442.0s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? It's worthless. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1444.0s)]
*  If you have a set on The Tonight Show, how many more tickets are you gonna sell? [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1446.0s)]
*  Six. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1450.0s)]
*  Seinfeld did one six, seven years ago. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1452.0s)]
*  It was cool to see them put together a late night set. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1454.0s)]
*  Norm's at the end of Letterman. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1456.0s)]
*  Unreal. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1458.0s)]
*  What do you think you are, Mars? [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1460.0s)]
*  Norm was a master. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1462.0s)]
*  He was a master. He was so pure. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1464.0s)]
*  Oh, he teared up at the end of that? That gets me every time. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1466.0s)]
*  Brutal. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1468.0s)]
*  Whatever happened to that guy? [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1470.0s)]
*  Oh, fuck, I forgot he vanished. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1472.0s)]
*  Bummer. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1474.0s)]
*  What a gangster way to go out. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1476.0s)]
*  I didn't even know he was sick. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1478.0s)]
*  Gangster way to go out. Not telling anybody. Blame it all on Adam Eaglet. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1480.0s)]
*  I know. None of his friends knew. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1482.0s)]
*  His biography, the book he wrote, just trashes Adam Eaglet. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1484.0s)]
*  It's great. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1488.0s)]
*  He calls him a Holocaust denier. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1490.0s)]
*  Doesn't mean you can't be a denier. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1492.0s)]
*  He's under an overpass bullying people. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1494.0s)]
*  Makes it worse. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1496.0s)]
*  That's what Adam's known for. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1498.0s)]
*  People see him and are like, are you blown guys under the bridge? [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1500.0s)]
*  That's a fucked up aspect of people. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1502.0s)]
*  You will have some white people who hate white people. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1504.0s)]
*  You will have some Jews who hate Jews. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1510.0s)]

*  You will have Jews that will join the Nazis. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1524.0s)]
*  Are you excusing Eaglet's behavior? [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1526.0s)]
*  No. He's a Jew. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1528.0s)]
*  It's a strange thing. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1530.0s)]
*  To be a traitor like that. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1532.0s)]
*  There's a compelling desire to join the enemy. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1534.0s)]
*  It's very weird. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1536.0s)]
*  What if you hate yourself? [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1538.0s)]
*  There's always been people that have joined the enemy during times of war. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1540.0s)]
*  Benedict Arnold. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1546.0s)]
*  Although I heard Benedict Arnold got set up. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1548.0s)]
*  I heard Benedict Arnold like another guy. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1550.0s)]
*  Shane knows about this. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1554.0s)]
*  What happened with Benedict Arnold? [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1556.0s)]

*  I'm sure there's something there. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1566.0s)]
*  Maybe his family wrote that. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1568.0s)]
*  Him and his wife escaped. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1570.0s)]
*  He went to the British. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1572.0s)]
*  He was a hero. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1574.0s)]
*  He was the captain of the fort at West Point. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1576.0s)]
*  He slipped out. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1580.0s)]
*  That was the only time they saw George Washington crying. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1582.0s)]
*  Maybe it was because of pussy. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1586.0s)]
*  He was with his wife. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1590.0s)]

*  Like a bitch. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1596.0s)]
*  And then where'd he go? Just straight to the Brits? [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1598.0s)]
*  There were ships out in the harbor. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1600.0s)]
*  He just went out and joined the British. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=1602.0s)]

*  seriously? So seriously. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2026.0s)]
*  Way too seriously. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2028.0s)]
*  Me and Matt were on their podcast. They were like [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2030.0s)]
*  we can beat you in basketball. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2032.0s)]
*  I was like I've seen you play basketball. They played each [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2034.0s)]
*  other once. And they can't play. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2036.0s)]
*  They dribble with their head down. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2038.0s)]
*  I was like we suck. Me and Matt suck. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2040.0s)]
*  But we can beat you. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2042.0s)]
*  And then they were like fine. $1000. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2044.0s)]
*  We were like alright let's play. We beat them at $11. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2046.0s)]
*  $12 nothing. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2048.0s)]
*  We got in a fight [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2050.0s)]
*  for a while over that. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2052.0s)]
*  Did they pay you? They just paid. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2054.0s)]
*  It was like a year and a half. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2056.0s)]
*  Lewis kept asking me [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2058.0s)]
*  to do the podcast. I was like I'm not doing it [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2060.0s)]
*  until you pay me. He's like I'll fucking pay you right now. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2062.0s)]
*  I don't give a fuck. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2064.0s)]
*  How come he didn't pay you immediately? [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2066.0s)]
*  Well he's Lewis. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2068.0s)]
*  You're supposed to get paid while he pays. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2070.0s)]
*  I think at the game. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2072.0s)]
*  After the game it got heated. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2074.0s)]
*  About what? [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2076.0s)]
*  Everything. Everybody was fighting. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2078.0s)]
*  You went too hard. We should have had Dave. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2080.0s)]
*  Dave wasn't here. Dave never agreed to go. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2082.0s)]
*  Me and Lewis got in a fight. I was a little out of line. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2084.0s)]
*  He was a little out of line. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2086.0s)]
*  Lewis is great at blowing. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2088.0s)]
*  No. It looked like it. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2090.0s)]
*  Lewis is great at flying up the handle and forgiving you the next day. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2092.0s)]
*  That's his thing? [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2094.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2096.0s)]
*  Me and him fight a lot. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2098.0s)]
*  Girls like that are a lot of fun aren't they? [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2100.0s)]
*  Actually I forgive them. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2102.0s)]
*  Sometimes you do. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2104.0s)]
*  They freak out. I go you're dumb. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2106.0s)]
*  What makes them fun [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2108.0s)]
*  sometimes makes them problematic. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2110.0s)]
*  You got that right. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2112.0s)]
*  My friend Tony always said that. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2114.0s)]
*  Psychotic and erotic are next door neighbors. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2116.0s)]
*  That's not bad. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2118.0s)]
*  They're right next door to each other. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2120.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. So are the butthole and the vagina. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2122.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2124.0s)]
*  Hold on. Don't tell that to Jesus. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2126.0s)]
*  Damn it. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2128.0s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2130.0s)]
*  You gotta ring the bell. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2132.0s)]
*  Jay was so mad that you beat him so bad. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2134.0s)]
*  Why are you so mad? [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2136.0s)]
*  Well Jay sometimes he just can't take it. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2138.0s)]
*  He's competitive. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2140.0s)]
*  Yeah. Don't play a video game with him. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2142.0s)]
*  Is Jay a big video gamer? [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2144.0s)]
*  He's competitive. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2146.0s)]
*  He's competitive. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2148.0s)]
*  Rarely. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2150.0s)]
*  What game are you playing? [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2152.0s)]
*  NBA Jam. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2154.0s)]
*  More basketball. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2156.0s)]
*  He plays basketball in video games. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2158.0s)]
*  He loves basketball. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2160.0s)]
*  So that was what started the argument. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2162.0s)]
*  He was like I'm getting pretty good. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2164.0s)]
*  Does he actually play basketball? [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2166.0s)]
*  That was in his apartment building. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2168.0s)]
*  I wore a chain wall at once. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2170.0s)]
*  He tackled me. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2172.0s)]
*  Why? [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2174.0s)]
*  That's his thing. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2176.0s)]
*  That's a joke. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2178.0s)]
*  I forgot to wear a chain. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2180.0s)]
*  I used to wear a chain wallet. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2182.0s)]
*  It's a great way to not lose your wallet. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2184.0s)]
*  I lost my wallet once in New York City. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2186.0s)]
*  I left it in the back of a cab. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2188.0s)]
*  It was such a pain in the ass. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2190.0s)]
*  I'd rather lose my wallet. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2192.0s)]
*  What if you get caught with a wallet inside a chain? [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2194.0s)]
*  Bro the best thing is [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2196.0s)]
*  it's so corny. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2198.0s)]
*  For the record. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2200.0s)]
*  He doesn't wear it anymore. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2202.0s)]
*  It's a little front zip up wallet for credit cards. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2204.0s)]
*  That's what I got. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2206.0s)]
*  I got cards, drivers license, all that shit. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2208.0s)]
*  But now you got multiple things here. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2210.0s)]
*  I want one thing. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2212.0s)]
*  I got a fanny pack. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2214.0s)]
*  That's a fanny pack. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2216.0s)]
*  Don't you bluff me motherfucker. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2218.0s)]
*  I wear that. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2220.0s)]
*  I got the same one Dice has. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2222.0s)]
*  That's where I learned about this model. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2224.0s)]
*  Dice had a fanny pack on. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2226.0s)]
*  I was like look at that fanny pack. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2228.0s)]
*  That's a beautiful fanny pack. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2230.0s)]
*  Where'd you get it? [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2232.0s)]
*  Roots of Canada. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2234.0s)]
*  I got it on HirePrime8.com. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2236.0s)]
*  They're legit from Roots. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2238.0s)]
*  Good band. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2240.0s)]
*  You're scared of fanny packs. I don't know why. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2242.0s)]
*  I don't care for them. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2244.0s)]
*  They're very convenient. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2246.0s)]
*  That's cowards. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2248.0s)]
*  You're scared. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2250.0s)]
*  You want the convenience of a fanny pack. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2252.0s)]
*  But you want it to be a little more awkward to wear. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2254.0s)]
*  Just so you don't look like you're wearing a fanny pack. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2256.0s)]
*  Go for it or don't go for it. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2258.0s)]
*  Don't be a coward. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2260.0s)]
*  Wear a fanny pack. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2262.0s)]
*  Sit right there. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2264.0s)]
*  Aren't you supposed to put it on your fanny though? [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2266.0s)]
*  I don't know why they call it a fanny pack. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2268.0s)]
*  Do you know fanny in English is pussy? [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2270.0s)]
*  No. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2272.0s)]
*  That's why they call it a fanny pack. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2274.0s)]
*  They were making fun of me. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2276.0s)]
*  What'd you call it? [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2278.0s)]
*  I'm doing Australia next week. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2280.0s)]
*  It's called the fanny guy tour. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2282.0s)]
*  They were like, mate, that's a vagina. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2284.0s)]
*  That's so funny. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2286.0s)]
*  Don't call it that over here. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2288.0s)]
*  They call it a bum bag over there. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2290.0s)]
*  A bum bag? [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2292.0s)]
*  Like your butt. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2294.0s)]
*  Like a fanny pack. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2296.0s)]
*  I was working the door at the convoy store and they [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2298.0s)]
*  make jokes and they come in and they're like, [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2300.0s)]
*  do you love fags in here? [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2302.0s)]
*  And I'm like, yes, whatever. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2304.0s)]
*  And then I got turned back around and they were just smoking. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2306.0s)]
*  And I was like, oh, no. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2308.0s)]
*  We shouldn't get in there. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2310.0s)]
*  Not on my watch. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2312.0s)]
*  If I got a vote, it'd be different. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2314.0s)]
*  Tony was there? [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2316.0s)]
*  Doee. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2318.0s)]
*  Well. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2320.0s)]
*  That went good though. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2322.0s)]
*  Someone's saying that though. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2324.0s)]
*  That's like willful ignorance. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2326.0s)]
*  They gotta know that that is a different meaning in the United States. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2328.0s)]
*  They have to know. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2330.0s)]
*  Because it's such a different meaning. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2332.0s)]
*  Not only that, everybody knows about that different meaning. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2334.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's a big one. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2336.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2338.0s)]
*  That and the loo. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2340.0s)]
*  And the boot. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2342.0s)]
*  That's all I got. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2344.0s)]
*  On British speak. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2346.0s)]
*  Trunk. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2348.0s)]
*  Elevator. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2350.0s)]
*  I think it's a truck. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2352.0s)]
*  And then a cookie is a cracker. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2354.0s)]
*  The boot is a weird one. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2356.0s)]
*  What do they call the front hood? [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2358.0s)]
*  The bonnet. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2360.0s)]
*  The boot is the trunk. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2362.0s)]
*  I suck. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2364.0s)]
*  Bonnet. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2366.0s)]
*  Also, we invented the car. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2368.0s)]
*  So why you changing the names? [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2370.0s)]
*  Why the fuck you spelling tire with a Y? [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2372.0s)]
*  Why you got a Y in it? [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2374.0s)]
*  Why you got a U in color? [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2376.0s)]
*  Color. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2378.0s)]
*  Flavor. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2380.0s)]
*  Maybe they invented the fucking English language. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2382.0s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2384.0s)]
*  There were no tires. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2386.0s)]
*  I'd say we perfected it. They invented it. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2388.0s)]
*  We're like not bad, not bad. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2390.0s)]
*  And then we ran with it. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2392.0s)]
*  They had to go on the other side of the road too, those dorks. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2394.0s)]
*  They put the steering wheel on the other side of the road. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2396.0s)]
*  That'll fuck you up. I drove on there. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2398.0s)]
*  It's hard. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2400.0s)]
*  Didn't Matthew Broderick get in a car accident because of that? [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2402.0s)]
*  No. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2404.0s)]
*  He's different now. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2406.0s)]
*  Broderick. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2408.0s)]
*  He was getting hit by Jennifer Grey. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2410.0s)]
*  That's the rumor. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2412.0s)]
*  Pull it up. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2414.0s)]
*  They were dating and now they're done. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2416.0s)]
*  Jennifer Grey? [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2418.0s)]
*  Nose job Jennifer Grey? [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2420.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2422.0s)]
*  Blowjob Jennifer Grey. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2424.0s)]
*  He was giving him a little bonnet. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2426.0s)]
*  Lorraine a bonnet. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2430.0s)]
*  Jesus, son. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2432.0s)]
*  Remember that story? That was big news. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2434.0s)]
*  That was the biggest story of all time. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2436.0s)]
*  Lorraine a bonnet through the dick in the wood in the field. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2438.0s)]
*  That was a giant story. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2440.0s)]
*  Of course it was. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2442.0s)]
*  What was his name? Bonnet? [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2444.0s)]
*  No, no, no. He was named after a well known actor. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2446.0s)]
*  John Wayne Bobbitt. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2448.0s)]
*  He was a running late night joke for [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2450.0s)]
*  years. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2452.0s)]
*  Forever. Every comic had a joke about him. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2454.0s)]
*  We have to have talked about this. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2456.0s)]
*  I don't think we talked about Bonnet. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2458.0s)]
*  That's the idea of just like you'd never find my dick in that field. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2460.0s)]
*  No way. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2462.0s)]
*  Good for that guy. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2464.0s)]
*  I think she just threw it out the window. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2466.0s)]
*  I know but mine's gone. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2468.0s)]
*  I think she probably threw it in a very specific area. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2470.0s)]
*  While they're driving? [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2472.0s)]
*  If it was just an earbud while you're biking it's the right time. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2474.0s)]
*  I don't know when to find a dick. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2476.0s)]
*  I don't know when she did it. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2478.0s)]
*  Airplane seat. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2480.0s)]
*  Well my dick's gone. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2482.0s)]
*  We're never getting that. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2484.0s)]
*  They sewed it back up. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2486.0s)]
*  They did the first [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2488.0s)]
*  I think recently [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2490.0s)]
*  they did the first penis transplant. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2492.0s)]
*  Let's get it going. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2494.0s)]
*  But they can't transplant your balls. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2496.0s)]
*  Good. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2498.0s)]
*  What happened? [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2500.0s)]
*  She left with it and drove away and threw it out the window. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2502.0s)]
*  Left the apartment with a severed appendage [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2504.0s)]
*  and drove away in her car after a long time driving. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2506.0s)]
*  It's a pretty good dick if you can find it. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2508.0s)]
*  Struggling to steer with one hand. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2510.0s)]
*  Who's that? [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2512.0s)]
*  She's a lady. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2514.0s)]
*  She's out the window. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2516.0s)]
*  Struggling to drive. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2518.0s)]
*  She eventually stopped and called 911 telling them what had happened. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2520.0s)]
*  And where it was. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2522.0s)]
*  It was found after an exhaustive search [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2524.0s)]
*  and after being washed with antiseptic [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2526.0s)]
*  and packed in saline ice. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2528.0s)]
*  It was reattached in the hospital. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2530.0s)]
*  And he did two pornos. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2532.0s)]
*  I remember the pornos. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2534.0s)]
*  Frank and Penis. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2536.0s)]
*  Frank and Penis? [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2538.0s)]
*  What was I just talking about? [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2540.0s)]
*  What were we just talking about while you pulled that up? [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2542.0s)]
*  Frank and Penis. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2544.0s)]
*  She ought to go with Frank and Weenie. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2546.0s)]
*  What was I just talking about right when we pulled that up? [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2548.0s)]
*  What were you talking about? [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2550.0s)]
*  We were talking about something different. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2552.0s)]
*  Docking. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2554.0s)]
*  In between there. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2556.0s)]
*  Brittany Greiner. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2558.0s)]
*  Bob it. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2560.0s)]
*  Penis transplant. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2562.0s)]
*  Transplant. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2564.0s)]
*  So they've done the first penis transplant. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2566.0s)]
*  But they can't transplant balls. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2568.0s)]
*  Because the balls carry your loads forever. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2570.0s)]
*  Even if you transplant something else, [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2572.0s)]
*  your balls carry your DNA. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2574.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2576.0s)]
*  So if you transplanted balls, [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2578.0s)]
*  there's an ethical problem. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2580.0s)]
*  Because that guy is obviously dead. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2582.0s)]
*  And he's still having kids. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2584.0s)]
*  You're having his kids. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2586.0s)]
*  Also if you get a dick transplant, you're going black though. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2588.0s)]
*  No. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2590.0s)]
*  Why would you go black? [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2592.0s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2594.0s)]
*  You want it to look like yours. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2596.0s)]
*  Imagine if that was a question. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2598.0s)]

*  What do you want? [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2604.0s)]
*  We could bleach it. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2606.0s)]
*  Doctors used that to give the patient testicles [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2608.0s)]

*  Bioethicists. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=2612.0s)]

*  I'm doing shows in Vegas. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3316.0s)]
*  Where are you doing? [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3318.0s)]
*  Or if you were doing any? [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3320.0s)]
*  If I did a theater, I would do that place at the Mirage. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3322.0s)]
*  I like that place a lot. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3324.0s)]
*  I think I'm doing that. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3326.0s)]
*  That place is the shit. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3328.0s)]
*  Last time I did the MGM Grand Arena, [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3330.0s)]
*  and that was pretty badass. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3332.0s)]
*  I'm not going to do that one. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3334.0s)]
*  I bet you could. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3336.0s)]
*  I'm going to do that theater. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3338.0s)]
*  There's another theater that I did too that's like 4,000. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3340.0s)]
*  What is that one? [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3342.0s)]
*  The one that's sort of connected to the MGM. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3344.0s)]
*  No, the other one. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3346.0s)]

*  It's like the Something Point Theater. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3358.0s)]
*  We've had the... [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3360.0s)]
*  Oh, the Park MGM. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3362.0s)]
*  That's a really good theater. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3364.0s)]
*  Was it like 4,700 capacity? [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3366.0s)]
*  That's a good one. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3368.0s)]

*  You can't beat that Mirage. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3374.0s)]
*  That fucking Terry Fador room is perfect. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3376.0s)]
*  It's angled, it sets up for you. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3378.0s)]

*  edged him, but it was a very, very good fight. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3608.0s)]

*  But back up that fight, [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3622.0s)]
*  does it show the 360 roundhouse kick [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3624.0s)]
*  he hit BJ with? Jesus. Call that thing, will ya? [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3626.0s)]
*  But look how he does that. That round kick [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3628.0s)]
*  to the straight punch in the same [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3630.0s)]
*  motion. The kick lands [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3632.0s)]
*  and the punch is right behind it. Straight into [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3634.0s)]
*  Big Brother Punches. He's so nasty. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3636.0s)]
*  He's so nasty. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3638.0s)]
*  He's got Lugui coming next. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3640.0s)]
*  He's gonna do a finger up the butt. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3642.0s)]
*  Big Brother Punches. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3644.0s)]
*  Oh, alright. Call it, will ya? [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3646.0s)]
*  Yeah. Geez, Louise. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3648.0s)]
*  What year was this? [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3650.0s)]
*  That was when BJ went [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3652.0s)]
*  to 145. And BJ [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3654.0s)]
*  at 145 was very depleted. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3656.0s)]
*  It was not a good move for him to get down to [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3658.0s)]
*  that weight class. GSP said he was the toughest fighter [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3660.0s)]
*  he's ever fought. Yeah, when BJ was [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3662.0s)]
*  155. But as he got older, he tried the lower [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3664.0s)]
*  weight classes. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3666.0s)]
*  Tied him down with bigger guys. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3668.0s)]
*  His body wasn't the same [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3670.0s)]
*  anymore. He was so good. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3672.0s)]
*  BJ was the motherfucker when he was in [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3674.0s)]
*  his prime. Hawaiian. But I always say [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3676.0s)]
*  that you gotta look at a guy in their prime. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3678.0s)]
*  Like Mike Tyson in his prime. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3680.0s)]
*  You gotta look at them in their prime. And then stop [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3682.0s)]
*  watching them. Yeah, you can't look at them when they're [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3684.0s)]
*  deteriorated and say, oh, overall [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3686.0s)]
*  they didn't. Because overall you're correct. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3688.0s)]
*  But if you wanna look at the greatest expression [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3690.0s)]
*  of martial arts, then you'd still only look at the [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3692.0s)]
*  primes. Just look at that part. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3694.0s)]
*  I would say the same for comedians. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3696.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3698.0s)]
*  Kinnison's my favorite [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3700.0s)]
*  example of that. Kinnison's a great example. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3702.0s)]
*  Did you see? No, that was called [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3704.0s)]
*  Lockheed with some prayer. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3706.0s)]
*  Oh. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3708.0s)]
*  This is the bad Utah card. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3710.0s)]
*  Look, this is the one I was talking about. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3712.0s)]
*  This is the card. Tony? [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3714.0s)]
*  Everyone is killer. Let me tell you something. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3716.0s)]
*  Bohovic at 205 is so fucking scary. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3718.0s)]
*  And for Alex to go right up [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3720.0s)]
*  and fight him. Derrick Lewis. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3722.0s)]
*  Derrick Lewis and Marko's Jirio [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3724.0s)]
*  De Lima. That's a great fight too. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3726.0s)]
*  Michael Chiesa and Kevin Holland. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3728.0s)]
*  That's a fucking great fight too. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3730.0s)]
*  Wonderboy is the man. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3732.0s)]
*  Cool dude. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3734.0s)]
*  And he's funny too. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3736.0s)]
*  Bohovic and Paheta. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3738.0s)]
*  Bro, you're going. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3740.0s)]
*  I'd love to go. That's a crazy fight. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3742.0s)]
*  Because you can't fuck up with Bohovic. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3744.0s)]
*  That guy throws thunder. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3746.0s)]
*  This guy's show and then pop over here. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3748.0s)]
*  That would be a good time. Let's get Pereira Izzi going. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3750.0s)]
*  It's right there, right? [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3752.0s)]
*  Why wouldn't they go three? [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3754.0s)]
*  Well, because I don't think Pereira really wants to make 85 anymore. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3756.0s)]
*  It's absolutely brutal. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3758.0s)]
*  And there's a lot of [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3760.0s)]
*  speculation as to that's why. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3762.0s)]
*  First of all, Israel hit him [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3764.0s)]
*  with the perfect punch. It was perfect. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3766.0s)]
*  It was perfect. The follow up was perfect. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3768.0s)]
*  It was a beautiful knockout. It was cool. Spectacular. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3770.0s)]
*  But a lot of people [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3772.0s)]
*  are speculating [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3774.0s)]
*  that he doesn't take a punch that well. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3776.0s)]
*  Because he cuts so much weight. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3778.0s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3780.0s)]
*  He'd be better if he was. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3782.0s)]
*  He walks around way over 205. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3784.0s)]
*  He walks around like 230. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3786.0s)]
*  It just seemed like they immediately [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3788.0s)]
*  got rid of the idea of a trilogy immediately. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3790.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? As soon as the fight ended, [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3792.0s)]
*  they were like, what are you doing next? [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3794.0s)]
*  Not even a mention of. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3796.0s)]
*  It's 1-1. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3798.0s)]
*  It's 1-1 in MMA and it's [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3800.0s)]
*  3-2, right? [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3802.0s)]
*  Overall? Yeah, 3-2 overall. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3804.0s)]
*  Anyone? Not now. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3806.0s)]
*  You already did some? [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3808.0s)]
*  What? I'll take a nibble. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3810.0s)]
*  Little nibble. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3812.0s)]
*  I'm still trying to wake up from that hangover. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3814.0s)]
*  That's a big fight for Pajero to go up to 205 [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3816.0s)]
*  and to fight Barovic. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3818.0s)]
*  Eat it. That's a big test. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3820.0s)]
*  I'm excited about that one. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3822.0s)]
*  Ha ha. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3824.0s)]
*  So with these chocolates, [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3826.0s)]
*  were these the ones we were eating last time? [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3828.0s)]
*  They're like one cap. Be careful. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3830.0s)]
*  He's funny too. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3832.0s)]
*  Volkonoski and Tua are the fucking bros. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3834.0s)]
*  Tua, the old shoe drink. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3836.0s)]
*  Half? Was that a lot? [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3838.0s)]
*  No, half's nothing. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3840.0s)]
*  Do you mean Tui Vasa? Thai Tui Vasa? [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3842.0s)]
*  You mean David Tua was another one, the boxer. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3844.0s)]
*  No, the shoe guy. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3846.0s)]
*  That's disgusting. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3848.0s)]
*  Do a shoeie when you're in Australia. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3850.0s)]
*  Bert Christchurch was saying he got a throat infection from doing shoeies in Australia. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3852.0s)]
*  That's from blowing dudes. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3854.0s)]
*  Yeah, blowing dudes. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3856.0s)]
*  Australia, Down Under. He didn't understand what it meant. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3858.0s)]
*  I mean sucking dicks. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3860.0s)]
*  I convinced him. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3862.0s)]
*  They tried to get me to do a shoeie when I was there. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3864.0s)]
*  What'd you do? [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3866.0s)]
*  I said no on stage. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3868.0s)]
*  Tui Vasa tried to drink a beer out of my shoe. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3870.0s)]
*  Tye tried to drink a beer out of my shoe in a post-fight interview. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3872.0s)]
*  No way. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3874.0s)]
*  I'm like, dude, I'm wearing that. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3876.0s)]
*  I have to wear that because I have to walk around. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3878.0s)]
*  It's disgusting. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3880.0s)]
*  I don't support that behavior. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3882.0s)]
*  That's the coolest shit they do. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3884.0s)]
*  I don't think so. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3886.0s)]
*  That was his fight. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3888.0s)]
*  I can see Shane in the show just going, no. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3890.0s)]
*  I said no. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3892.0s)]
*  Those guys, they huck louis. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3894.0s)]
*  Yeah, they spit into it. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3896.0s)]
*  If you watch Tui Vasa do it, Vogue will be standing there with him going, into it. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3898.0s)]
*  What? [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3900.0s)]
*  They huck loogies. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3902.0s)]
*  Big, thick ones. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3904.0s)]
*  They probably drink milk so they have extra phlegm. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3906.0s)]
*  That's not friendly. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3908.0s)]
*  That's gayer than Jews. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3910.0s)]
*  Is it? [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3912.0s)]
*  A huck a luge? [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3914.0s)]
*  That's less gay. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3916.0s)]
*  I think sucking someone's cock and cum coming in your mouth is the most gay. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3918.0s)]
*  Well, that's literally gay by definition. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3922.0s)]
*  You might have a point on that. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3924.0s)]
*  That's sound reason. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3926.0s)]
*  You know when you spell it out like that? [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=3928.0s)]

*  He just goes, so? [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4562.0s)]
*  It was such an end of the conversation. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4564.0s)]
*  Ron Bennington's Unmasked [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4566.0s)]
*  with Patrice O'Neill is the best. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4568.0s)]
*  It's the best. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4570.0s)]
*  Unmasked is so good. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4572.0s)]
*  His Unmasked with Norton, [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4574.0s)]
*  everything I did on podcasting was just mimicked off that. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4576.0s)]
*  Great broadcaster. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4578.0s)]
*  Isn't that interesting what podcasting is now? [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4580.0s)]
*  What that was. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4582.0s)]
*  His Unmasked was great. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4584.0s)]
*  It was an unusual thing. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4586.0s)]
*  Sit down and just talk to someone one on one. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4588.0s)]
*  As a young comic, there was none of that. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4590.0s)]
*  Remember the one on comedy CDs? [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4592.0s)]
*  I used to listen to that. Woody Allen, Seinfeld. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4594.0s)]
*  Now young comics have so much. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4596.0s)]
*  It's like a wealth that never ends. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4598.0s)]
*  The podcast. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4600.0s)]
*  Four masters. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4602.0s)]
*  Fucking Guts Gay. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4604.0s)]
*  Oh, the true masters. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4608.0s)]
*  Like an octopus. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4610.0s)]
*  Loose lips. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4612.0s)]
*  Sink ships. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4614.0s)]
*  Yeah, they have so much more to go on. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4616.0s)]
*  So much more to watch too. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4618.0s)]
*  That's the most amazing thing. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4620.0s)]
*  It was hard to get a hold of a good VHS back then. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4622.0s)]
*  You had to loan CDs to each other. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4624.0s)]
*  You heard a good CD of somebody. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4626.0s)]
*  You're like, let me have that. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4628.0s)]
*  I never even saw comedy. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4630.0s)]
*  Yeah, right. Only listened to it. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4632.0s)]
*  My dad had a Carlin CD. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4634.0s)]
*  When did you see it? [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4636.0s)]
*  The first two specials I remember was [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4638.0s)]
*  Dane Cook and Carlos Mencia's Comedy Central Presents. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4640.0s)]
*  And I remember sitting there going, [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4642.0s)]
*  God damn, this is it. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4644.0s)]
*  That's the top of the mountain. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4646.0s)]
*  I never saw shit. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4648.0s)]
*  Comedy Central put a lot of stuff on [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4650.0s)]
*  for people who didn't have HBO. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4652.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, those half hours were huge. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4654.0s)]
*  I did my Comedy Central special on 2014. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4656.0s)]
*  The idea was if I did it anywhere else, [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4658.0s)]
*  we'd get less people to see it. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4660.0s)]
*  More people would see it. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4662.0s)]
*  Comedy Central was huge back then. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4664.0s)]
*  I watched all those. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4666.0s)]
*  How did they fuck that up? [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4668.0s)]
*  I'll tell you. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4670.0s)]
*  They didn't adapt. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4672.0s)]
*  When they got rid of Ari Shaffir, [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4674.0s)]
*  who was the host of This Is Not Happening, [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4676.0s)]
*  he got a superior deal at Netflix. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4678.0s)]
*  And they wouldn't allow him to continue his show. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4680.0s)]
*  It was nuts. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4682.0s)]
*  They lost their fucking minds. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4684.0s)]
*  Like you were saying, sometimes Jews hate Jews. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4686.0s)]
*  True. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4688.0s)]
*  They didn't run that company. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4690.0s)]
*  Comedy Central was run by Norwegians? [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4692.0s)]
*  The funniest people alive. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4694.0s)]
*  We were trying to figure out [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4696.0s)]
*  you were going to pay everybody. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4698.0s)]
*  We were trying to figure out how to do it the right way. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4700.0s)]
*  They blackmailed me. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4702.0s)]
*  They were trying to hold it over my head. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4704.0s)]
*  They were going, we're going to fire your whole crew [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4706.0s)]
*  that's been around for five years. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4708.0s)]
*  We're going to fire them with two weeks out. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4710.0s)]
*  Good luck paying their rent. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4712.0s)]
*  Or you fucking comply. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4714.0s)]
*  They said it that way? [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4716.0s)]
*  Or you comply and you fucking turn down this Netflix deal. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4718.0s)]
*  I was like, no fucking way. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4720.0s)]
*  Rogan was like, I'll host an episode for free. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4722.0s)]
*  I thought I'd help you. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4724.0s)]
*  I was like, okay. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4726.0s)]
*  You were going to do one Tom? [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4728.0s)]
*  We'll get a bunch of people that are your friends. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4730.0s)]
*  We'll host them for free. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4732.0s)]
*  They were so mad. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4734.0s)]
*  They went full... [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4736.0s)]
*  They just collapsed. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4738.0s)]
*  What are they doing now? [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4740.0s)]
*  Nothing. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4742.0s)]
*  You watch their clips on their studio. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4744.0s)]
*  If you look at the drop off of Comedy Central, [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4746.0s)]
*  it's got to be insane. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4748.0s)]
*  Think about it, they had Chappelle Show. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4750.0s)]
*  South Park and Chappelle Show. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4752.0s)]
*  Daily Show. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4754.0s)]
*  South Park was great. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4756.0s)]
*  I think they're more... [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4758.0s)]
*  They're just a studio now. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4760.0s)]
*  They take their stuff and sell it off. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4762.0s)]
*  Tosh.0 was gigantic. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4764.0s)]
*  What happened to Tosh? What's he doing? [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4766.0s)]
*  He's around, he's so funny. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4768.0s)]
*  He's hilarious. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4770.0s)]
*  He's an underrated comic. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4772.0s)]
*  Is he doing stand up? [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4774.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4776.0s)]
*  I think that rape thing fucked him up. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4778.0s)]
*  The joke he had about that joke was great. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4780.0s)]
*  I had a joke about that too. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4782.0s)]
*  About his thing? [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4784.0s)]
*  Yeah, about the cancel thing. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4786.0s)]
*  That was 2014. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4788.0s)]
*  I feel like he fell off after that. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4790.0s)]
*  There was a petition to get him fired. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4792.0s)]
*  He fell off. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4794.0s)]
*  He's doing all these theaters. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4796.0s)]
*  He's on the road to fucking sold out places. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4798.0s)]
*  What the fuck are these guys doing? [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4800.0s)]
*  He's doing the mirage. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4802.0s)]
*  Good for Tosh. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4804.0s)]
*  Still killing it. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4806.0s)]
*  There's nothing he does constantly. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4808.0s)]
*  That was when I was in college. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4810.0s)]
*  They had great writers. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4812.0s)]
*  I was listening to all of his albums. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4814.0s)]
*  He was so good. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4816.0s)]
*  He has a new spell. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4818.0s)]
*  It's great, but no one talked about it. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4820.0s)]
*  It was on Comedy Central. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4822.0s)]
*  So funny. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4824.0s)]
*  It's like Roy Wood. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4826.0s)]
*  They lock him up in this deal [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4828.0s)]
*  and the whole thing collapses. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4830.0s)]
*  I guess I'm still supposed to perform [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4832.0s)]
*  at the World Trade Center. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4834.0s)]
*  You didn't have a deal to do a special there. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4836.0s)]
*  You had it, you didn't have an exclusive deal. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4838.76s)]
*  That was so insidious about it. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4840.8s)]
*  You were, you had the option to go other places. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4842.48s)]
*  I could do whatever I wanted. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4845.6s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4846.68s)]
*  And they're like, no way. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4847.52s)]
*  And then they said, I was like, [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4848.34s)]
*  guys, it'll bring more viewers to the show. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4849.4s)]
*  They go, we think it'll bring more, [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4851.04s)]
*  our show will bring more viewers to Netflix. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4852.6s)]
*  Which at the time, like. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4854.76s)]
*  Oh, good call. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4855.96s)]
*  What? [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4857.68s)]
*  All of them work at Netflix now, by the way. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4858.52s)]
*  Yeah, some of them do. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4860.28s)]
*  It was so bad. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4861.24s)]
*  That's the thing about all that. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=4862.08s)]

*  I probably eventually drove home, [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6055.139999999999s)]
*  but I might've stayed with Lee for a while. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6056.42s)]
*  At least two hours, [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6057.86s)]

*  No. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6063.099999999999s)]
*  That void is bad, I hate that void. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6063.94s)]
*  Those breath strips, that was the whole six hours at UFC. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6065.5s)]

*  You shouldn't. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6076.0599999999995s)]
*  No. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6076.9s)]
*  You should do it once. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6077.74s)]
*  I did. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6078.58s)]

*  my favorite place to watch is the Apex Center. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6089.54s)]
*  Where's that? [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6090.86s)]
*  The Apex Center is a small arena [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6091.7s)]
*  that the UFC built in Vegas [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6093.38s)]
*  for their Tuesday Night Contenders series, [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6096.099999999999s)]

*  So it's a smaller cage. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6102.0599999999995s)]
*  And there's only a hundred. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6104.0599999999995s)]
*  A smaller cage? [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6105.179999999999s)]
*  Yes, the cage is like 40% smaller. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6106.0199999999995s)]
*  Contended? [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6108.0199999999995s)]
*  There's only a hundred people in the fucking room. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6108.86s)]
*  It's amazing. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6111.66s)]
*  Like the Pearl used to be? [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6112.82s)]

*  The one he won. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6121.860000000001s)]

*  It was a destruction. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6123.54s)]
*  It was like the finest performance of Francis' career. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6125.78s)]
*  Cause he was patient and just moving forward [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6128.5s)]
*  and just, oh, just a systematic destruction. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6131.66s)]

*  And he goes, yep, that would work. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6192.820000000001s)]
*  Listen to this. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6193.64s)]
*  He had the bad hair. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6194.4800000000005s)]
*  Listen, there's no audience. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6195.620000000001s)]
*  Look at the audience. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6196.9400000000005s)]
*  My hands are shaking. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6197.900000000001s)]
*  I'm so sweaty right now. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6199.660000000001s)]
*  I get so nervous. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6201.3s)]
*  These were weird times. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6202.860000000001s)]
*  These title fights, man, are the best. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6204.06s)]
*  This is the heavyweight championship of the world. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6206.86s)]
*  It's in a small cage, which is terrible for Stipe. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6209.5s)]
*  Why do they make it a smaller cage? [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6212.9s)]
*  Because they do it for all the fights there. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6214.299999999999s)]
*  It's a smaller arena. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6215.66s)]
*  That's not good. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6217.139999999999s)]
*  We had a smaller cage that we used [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6218.719999999999s)]
*  for the Ultimate Fighter back in the day [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6220.139999999999s)]
*  when we fought at the Palm. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6221.5s)]
*  We had fights at the Palm. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6223.459999999999s)]
*  The Pearl. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6224.78s)]
*  The Pearl at the Palm, right. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6225.62s)]
*  The Palm Casino. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6226.98s)]
*  Why is that bad for Stipe? [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6228.219999999999s)]
*  Because you gotta get away from that guy sometimes. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6229.54s)]
*  Anytime you can't move backwards [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6232.299999999999s)]
*  because there's a cage there, [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6233.94s)]
*  you gotta get away from that guy. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6235.5s)]
*  From which guy, Francis? [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6236.66s)]
*  The way he beat Francis is so destructive. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6237.5s)]
*  He's so terrifying. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6238.98s)]
*  It's still one and one, though, right? [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6239.98s)]
*  They never did a tiebreaker. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6241.78s)]
*  It's one and one, right. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6243.86s)]
*  This was the tiebreaker. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6245.06s)]
*  This was, you're seeing Francis [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6246.86s)]
*  trained by Extreme Couture now. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6248.94s)]
*  So he's with Eric Nixik, who's a really intelligent, [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6252.1s)]
*  very, very good trainer. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6255.82s)]
*  And he's got him very patient. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6258.1s)]
*  And he's not just charging in like he did in the first fight. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6260.3s)]
*  He's picking him apart. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6263.3s)]
*  So he's chopping at his legs. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6264.7s)]
*  Well, I'm just talking there about the smaller octagon. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6267.62s)]
*  Damn. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6270.34s)]
*  Yeah, you can't be on mushrooms for this. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6271.26s)]
*  Yeah, this is a lot. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6273.66s)]
*  Yeah, you'd be like. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6274.58s)]
*  But to be there live, man. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6275.42s)]
*  Oh, there's three people in there. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6276.54s)]
*  No crowd. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6278.0199999999995s)]
*  It was fucking incredible. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6278.9s)]
*  Stipe should have gotten a haircut. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6281.98s)]
*  30% smaller. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6284.139999999999s)]
*  All right. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6288.9s)]
*  Oh, that's gotta hurt. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6289.74s)]
*  Boy, he's a tough guy. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6291.86s)]
*  Dangerous. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6293.139999999999s)]
*  Look at those back muscles. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6295.02s)]
*  Stipe's an animal. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6296.18s)]
*  He's the most successful heavyweight champion of all time. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6297.14s)]
*  You think? [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6299.58s)]
*  Yes, 100%. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6300.42s)]
*  He goes down in the record books as the guy [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6301.26s)]
*  who defended the title the most ever. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6303.18s)]
*  He's a fucking animal. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6305.22s)]
*  He's beating everybody. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6306.18s)]
*  Wow. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6307.26s)]
*  But you know, you get time catches up to you. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6308.1s)]
*  Wars catch up to you. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6311.42s)]
*  And then Francis, who's a fucking monster. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6312.620000000001s)]
*  Francis is a monster. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6315.740000000001s)]
*  He was ready. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6317.18s)]
*  He was ready. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6318.02s)]
*  He knew that was coming. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6318.860000000001s)]
*  But now Francis has takedown defense. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6319.700000000001s)]
*  Look at this defense. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6321.22s)]
*  It's huge. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6322.22s)]
*  Giant. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6323.06s)]
*  And then Francis spins around and gets his back. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6324.7s)]
*  Look at this. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6326.46s)]
*  So this is Francis now that can grapple. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6327.299999999999s)]
*  And he takes Stipe down and beats him up. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6329.259999999999s)]
*  See, Francis, after the first Stipe fight, [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6332.0199999999995s)]
*  he really, really, really evolved. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6335.5s)]
*  He evolved every aspect of his game. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6338.339999999999s)]
*  And he evolved his grappling. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6340.86s)]
*  And he beat Cyril Gonn, grappling with one fucking knee. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6342.0199999999995s)]
*  Man, his knee was destroyed. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6344.94s)]
*  And he beat one of the most dangerous [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6346.219999999999s)]
*  heavyweight contenders in Cyril Gonn. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6347.98s)]
*  Francis, like right now, it's a big loss in my mind. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6349.9s)]
*  Like him going over to the PFL, it really bums me out. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6353.1s)]
*  I understand it. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6355.38s)]
*  I'm happy he's gonna get paid. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6357.02s)]
*  I'm happy he's gonna get the box. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6358.38s)]
*  But I loved watching this guy fight in the UFC. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6360.14s)]
*  He was a fucking monster. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6362.54s)]
*  Oh, Cyril Gonn in 60 seconds. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6364.06s)]
*  He was so good, dude. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6368.5s)]
*  And he is so good. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6370.22s)]
*  Wow. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6371.38s)]
*  It's gonna be interesting. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6372.26s)]
*  I just don't know if we're gonna have him fight. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6373.1s)]
*  Cyril Gonn with a win. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6374.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6375.780000000001s)]
*  So that, anyway, go to the end of it. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6377.740000000001s)]
*  Just so you can see the knockout. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6379.46s)]
*  Cyril Gonn, baby Gonn. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6380.3s)]
*  That was Cyril Gonn, girl. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6381.86s)]
*  Cyril Gonn, girl. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6384.74s)]
*  Sorry, we're having fun. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6385.58s)]
*  I'm on mushroom. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6387.54s)]
*  If you were eating edibles, here's the end of it. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6388.38s)]
*  If you were eating edibles here. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6390.299999999999s)]
*  Who would you rather fuck? [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6391.86s)]
*  This is which round now? [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6393.34s)]
*  This is the second round. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6394.5s)]
*  This is where he stomped him. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6395.66s)]
*  Old Herb Dean. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6400.86s)]
*  Oh fuck. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6401.9s)]
*  Dude, right through. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6403.42s)]
*  Right through the defenses. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6404.94s)]
*  Damn, how does he take those? [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6406.58s)]
*  What a chin. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6408.46s)]
*  He's throwing them back. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6409.299999999999s)]
*  Oh, that hurt. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6410.139999999999s)]
*  I can't watch. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6412.18s)]
*  It shows training. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6413.82s)]
*  The training was good. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6414.94s)]
*  Imagine if comedians had coaches. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6417.58s)]
*  We'd be so much better. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6419.38s)]
*  We'd be better. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6420.38s)]
*  Hey, hey, there's someone in the crowd you can go to. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6421.22s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6422.98s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6423.82s)]
*  Switch to that joke. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6424.66s)]
*  You should've gone to that joke. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6425.7s)]
*  Don't, don't, don't. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6426.82s)]
*  That lady's gonna stomp, stomp. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6427.66s)]
*  Well, some guys do that where they kind of hire people [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6428.5s)]
*  to work their material with them. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6430.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6432.34s)]
*  Chris Rock always did that. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6433.18s)]
*  He would do his sets and have a group of guys [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6434.0199999999995s)]

*  and they're screaming at each other, [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6873.14s)]
*  we gotta go back, we gotta go back. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6874.26s)]
*  So they turn around and go back. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6875.62s)]
*  They go back to the spot and he's gone. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6876.7s)]
*  Five days later the guy shows up with this crazy story. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6879.0199999999995s)]
*  He shows up, makes a phone call, [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6883.379999999999s)]
*  he calls the police, calls his family. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6884.66s)]
*  He said he got abducted by that craft and they fixed him. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6886.62s)]
*  They said his body was broken from the beam [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6889.7s)]
*  and they took him aboard and he had these encounters [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6892.339999999999s)]
*  and there was a movie called Fire in the Sky. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6894.66s)]
*  Why is it a beam in the first place? [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6896.7s)]
*  The movies obviously, they took a lot of liberties [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6899.099999999999s)]
*  with the story. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6901.62s)]
*  Wow. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6902.459999999999s)]
*  Was it D.B. Cooper? [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6903.94s)]
*  Is that the guy who was in it? [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6905.219999999999s)]
*  Oh I know that guy. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6906.7s)]
*  That's a different guy. [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6907.54s)]
*  Yeah, D.B. Sweeney. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6908.62s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6909.74s)]
*  Right. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6910.58s)]
*  He's the guy that jumped out of the plane with the money. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6911.42s)]
*  They don't know who that guy is. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6914.9800000000005s)]
*  That guy's a bad ass. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6915.82s)]
*  That guy's a nut. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6916.66s)]
*  That guy fucking died to me. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6917.5s)]
*  Really? [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6918.82s)]
*  That guy had two broken legs and he was eaten by dogs. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6919.66s)]
*  He jumped out into the middle of the woods [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6923.54s)]
*  with no parachute and he survived I guess. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6925.18s)]
*  The craziest is the cows that lose all their skin. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6927.1s)]
*  Oh no, no, no, you're talking about cattle mutilations. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6931.46s)]
*  Yes. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6933.5s)]
*  Yeah, they don't know what the fuck that is. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6934.34s)]
*  No explanation. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6935.16s)]
*  Tournament site out? [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6936.0s)]
*  They cut organs out with laser precision. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6936.98s)]
*  They removed the blood from the body [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6941.259999999999s)]
*  with no visible method. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6943.299999999999s)]
*  That's a stupid cat. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6944.7s)]
*  No, there's weird stuff that does happen to cows. [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6945.54s)]
*  What about those images up here in the fields? [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6948.7s)]
*  Crops are up there. [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6951.94s)]
*  What the fuck is that? [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6952.78s)]
*  Those are weird dudes. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6953.62s)]
*  No one's talking about that anymore. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6954.459999999999s)]
*  Acropolis. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6955.66s)]
*  I think people gave up on that. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6956.5s)]
*  Those are dudes? [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6958.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6959.459999999999s)]
*  Those are the hell. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6960.299999999999s)]
*  I think people gave up on that. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6961.139999999999s)]
*  It's a landscape guys. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6961.98s)]
*  Yeah, they gave up on them. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6962.82s)]
*  Crops circles. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6963.66s)]
*  They were beacons. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6964.5s)]
*  I don't hear about that anymore. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6965.339999999999s)]
*  Those dudes were doing it. [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6966.34s)]
*  Well definitely dudes were doing it. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6967.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6968.58s)]
*  But also some of them were a little more interesting. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6969.42s)]
*  Yeah, some were intricate. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6972.14s)]
*  There was also, they were folded into place in a way [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6973.62s)]
*  where it seemed like a great deal of energy [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6978.3s)]
*  was in the husk or the stalk. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6981.06s)]
*  Autistic men did this. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6983.5s)]
*  And they had blown out. [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6984.34s)]
*  No, no, no, there were some of them [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6985.56s)]
*  that they were trying to say, [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6987.740000000001s)]
*  like there was a way that you could do these things, [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6989.14s)]
*  but it's very clear when someone did it that way. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6993.02s)]
*  Wow. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6995.26s)]
*  Yeah, crop circles were made by super natural forces [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6997.02s)]
*  named Doug and Dave. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=6998.5s)]
*  Intrigue patterns carved in fields across England [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7000.06s)]
*  in the 1980s were a viral phenomena [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7002.42s)]
*  long before the interest fed us [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7004.900000000001s)]
*  such prankster curiosities daily. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7006.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7008.58s)]
*  What these, the people that believe that some of them are, [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7009.42s)]
*  they have something else to them. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7012.46s)]
*  But what about the cows? [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7014.18s)]
*  Cause that, they would pull the blood out. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7015.780000000001s)]
*  Super covers. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7017.620000000001s)]
*  This is a different thing. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7018.46s)]
*  One drop, not one drop of blood. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7019.58s)]
*  Cattle mystery mutilator. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7021.1s)]
*  Not one drop of blood. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7021.9400000000005s)]
*  That's the weird one. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7023.58s)]
*  This sounds like faulty reporting when they found the cow. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7024.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7027.3s)]
*  I think that's more likely. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7028.139999999999s)]
*  People have done things. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7029.98s)]
*  People have done things. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7031.82s)]
*  Each and all body parts precisely removed. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7033.139999999999s)]
*  Like someone has cut the organs out of that cow. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7035.62s)]
*  A weird dude is more likely. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7038.54s)]
*  Now if it was a person that's doing it, [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7039.38s)]
*  but the way they were doing it is very unusual. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7041.0599999999995s)]
*  No blood, come on. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7043.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7044.58s)]
*  I mean, I don't know why the fuck aliens would do that. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7045.42s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7047.0199999999995s)]
*  But it does make sense. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7048.3s)]
*  They're weird. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7050.66s)]
*  They what's though? [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7051.5s)]
*  They want to learn. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7052.34s)]
*  A lot of people lean towards aliens. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7053.16s)]
*  But why would they do that? [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7054.76s)]
*  The same reason that a fucking alien would. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7055.88s)]
*  But why no blood? [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7057.8s)]
*  You know what they had, a cow blood? [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7058.96s)]
*  Why would an alien want cow blood? [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7060.8s)]
*  To learn about our creature. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7062.4s)]
*  About cows. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7063.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7064.48s)]
*  You gotta start somewhere. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7065.32s)]
*  Studying us like butterflies. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7066.16s)]
*  Imagine if it was demons. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7067.0s)]
*  But they couldn't quite. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7068.68s)]
*  They couldn't quite. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7070.48s)]
*  They didn't have the authority to go after people yet. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7072.6s)]
*  So they let them have a few cows every now and then [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7076.24s)]
*  just to keep the status quo. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7078.56s)]
*  Cut it out, Joey. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7079.4s)]
*  Give me the wheelie. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7080.24s)]
*  They lived for thousands of years. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7081.08s)]
*  They lived for thousands of years, these demons. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7082.48s)]
*  They really just want to torture humans. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7084.36s)]
*  They got to feast. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7086.0s)]
*  And gut them and suck their blood out [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7086.839999999999s)]
*  and leave their fucking skin carcasses. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7088.719999999999s)]
*  Lil Nas X is gonna come up here and give you a fucking lap dance. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7091.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they always talk about natural. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7093.879999999999s)]
*  You better have that baby come, dude. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7094.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we're blaming it on aliens when it's demons. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7096.32s)]
*  Just demons. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7098.759999999999s)]
*  Demons practicing. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7099.599999999999s)]
*  They're like, okay, go take a cow, you fucking freaks. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7100.679999999999s)]
*  Practice for the invasion. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7103.28s)]
*  They just go practice for what they're gonna do to us. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7104.12s)]
*  Once they get the green light. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7106.32s)]
*  Once people are like inexcusably evil. [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7107.4s)]
*  Once there's just like every country is ruled [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7111.56s)]

*  They have a pride section. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7225.2s)]
*  It's hard to think they're stopping selling some stuff [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7226.44s)]
*  because some employees were getting harassed [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7228.96s)]
*  by people coming in and asking like why are you selling? [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7231.599999999999s)]
*  They were getting harassed. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7233.639999999999s)]

*  that's what it did with the seller. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7235.32s)]
*  When Louis came back, the old waitress was like fuck you. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7236.599999999999s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7241.839999999999s)]

*  That's a weird one because you know Target only did that [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7244.96s)]
*  because they thought it was gonna make them more money. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7247.5599999999995s)]
*  Everything, they're a giant corporation. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7249.24s)]

*  it's because they wanna make more money. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7251.839999999999s)]
*  So it's like that's how these marketing people [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7253.5599999999995s)]
*  that you were talking about. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7255.92s)]
*  That's how they think about things. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7256.88s)]
*  They look at it through the eyes [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7258.16s)]
*  and also the eyes of the university [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7260.04s)]
*  because they just got out of this system [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7261.76s)]
*  that indoctrinates you to a very specific way of thinking. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7263.16s)]
*  It takes a while to shake once you get out in the real world [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7266.4400000000005s)]
*  and you realize like oh this is just as authoritarian. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7269.72s)]
*  This is just as constrictive. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7273.16s)]
*  Or like in college, you're like there's so many trans. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7275.16s)]
*  And then you go to the real world, [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7278.04s)]
*  we're like oh there's like four. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7279.12s)]
*  Right. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7280.4800000000005s)]
*  Like Saturn did a whole campaign marketing to women [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7281.32s)]
*  and they fucking skyrocketed women in sales. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWGkyl1tOKQ&t=7285.0s)]
