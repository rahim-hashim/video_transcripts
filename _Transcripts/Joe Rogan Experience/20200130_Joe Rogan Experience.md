# Joe Rogan Experience #1419 - Daryl Davis
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [January 30, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGTQ0Wj6yIg)
*  Two, one, good. Hello, Darrell.
*  Hey, Joe, how are you doing?
*  My pleasure. Thank you for being here. Really, really appreciate it.
*  Thank you.
*  I read your story. I saw a thing about you on NPR and it's crazy. You've converted how
*  many people? 200 KKK members? You've got them to drop their robes?
*  Right. Some directly, some indirectly, yes.
*  How did that all happen?
*  Wow. You know, I keep running into these guys. I'm a musician by trade.
*  Right. Blues musician, right?
*  Rock and roll, blues, swing, jazz. My degree's in jazz, but hey, I'll play whatever you want
*  me to play. You're paying, I'm playing. So, you know, everybody likes music, even the
*  KKK. So, use that to my advantage. I was playing at a bar one night in Frederick, Maryland,
*  an all-white bar. And when I say all-white, I don't mean that blacks couldn't go in.
*  What I mean is that blacks chose not to go in. They weren't welcome. And here I was in
*  this bar with this country band, a friend of mine's band. I was the only black guy
*  in the band, only black guy in the bar. And upon finishing the first set, I'm walking
*  to the band table and somebody came up and put their arm around my shoulder. I turned
*  around to see who it was. It was a white gentleman, maybe 15, 18 years older than me. And he says,
*  yeah, yeah, I really enjoy your music. I said, thank you. And he pointed at the stage
*  and said, you know, I've seen this here band before, but I never seen you before. Where
*  did you come from? And I explained, yeah, you know, they told me they played here before.
*  But this is my first time in this place. I just joined the band. And he said, well, man,
*  I really like your piano playing. This is the first time I ever heard a black man play
*  Lewis. And I wasn't offended, but I was rather surprised because as I said, you know, this
*  guy's like maybe 15 years older than me. And he didn't he did not know the black origin
*  of Jerry Lee Lewis's style of piano playing. I explained it to him. I got it from the same
*  place Jerry Lee did from black blues and boogie woogie piano players where the guy was incredulous.
*  Oh, no, no, no, Jerry Lee invented that. I never heard no black man play like that.
*  Except for you. So I'm thinking, OK, well, this guy I never heard of, Little Richard
*  or Fats Domino. And I said, look, man, I know Jerry Lee Lewis. He's a friend of mine. He's
*  told me himself we learned how to play. The guy did not buy that I need Jerry Lee. He
*  didn't buy that Jerry Lee learned anything from black people. But he was so fascinated
*  that he wanted to buy me a drink. I was like a novelty to him. So I went back to his table.
*  I had a cranberry juice. And then he announces this is the first time I ever sat down, had
*  a drink with a black man. And now I'm I'm the one who's incredulous. Like, how can that
*  be? You know, I've sat down with thousands of white people. Anybody else had a meal,
*  a beverage, a conversation. How was it this guy had never done that? And innocently, I
*  asked him, I said, why? He didn't answer me at first. He stared down at the tabletop.
*  And I asked him again, and his buddy sitting next to him elbowed him in the side and said,
*  tell him, tell him, tell him. I said, tell me. I'm trying to figure out what is this
*  mystery. He looks at me just as plain as day. And he says, I'm a member of the Ku Klux Klan.
*  Well, I burst out laughing. You know, it was getting weirder by the second half. And I
*  knew a lot about the Klan. I'd been studying racism since I was a 10 year old kid, because
*  of an incident that happened to me back then. And I bought books on black supremacy, white
*  supremacy, the KKK, the Nazis, the neo Nazis, try to understand this mentality. And I knew
*  a Klansman would not come up and just throw his arm around some black guy's shoulder and
*  praise his talent and want to hang out with him and buy him a drink. So this guy's jerking
*  me around. So I'm laughing. And he goes inside his pocket and pulls out his wallet and produces
*  his Klan membership card.
*  They have cards?
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. And he gave me his card. I looked at it. And I recognized the Klan insignia,
*  which is a red circle with a white cross and a red blood drop in the center of the cross.
*  And I realized, oh, man, this thing's for real. So I stopped laughing. It wasn't funny
*  anymore. And I gave it back to him. And we chatted about the Klan and different things.
*  But the dude gave me his phone number and wanted me to call him whenever I was to return
*  to this bar so he could bring his friends, meaning Klansmen and Klanswomen, to see this
*  black guy play like Jerry Lee. I'm not sure he called me a black guy to his friends, but
*  I said, I'll call you. So I would call him every six weeks on a Wednesday or Thursday
*  and say, hey, man, you know, we're down at the Silver Dollar Friday and Saturday. Come
*  on out. He'd come out both nights. He'd bring Klansmen and Klanswomen. And they'd come and
*  gather around the bandstand and watch me play the piano or get out there and dance to our
*  music. Now, you know, they didn't come in robes and hoods, right? They came in street
*  clothes. And on the break, I would go to his table, say hello. Some of them were very curious.
*  They'd hang out there and want to meet me and talk to me. Others would see me coming
*  and get up and take off and go stand somewhere in the part of the room where it's like,
*  I just want to see you. I don't want to deal with you kind of thing. So that was fine.
*  And I decided later on, I would write a book because I'd been looking for an answer to
*  a question that I had formed when I was age 10. My question was, how can you hate me when
*  you don't even know me? And this was a result of having marched in a Cub Scout parade at
*  the age of 10, being the only black scout in this parade. And while most people on the
*  streets and sidewalks were cheering us, we were marching from Lexington to Concord, Massachusetts,
*  to commemorate the ride of Paul Revere. And people were waving flags and yelling and screaming,
*  the British are coming and all of a good time, except for one small pocket of people who
*  were throwing rocks and bottles at me. And at age 10, my first thought was, oh, those people
*  over there don't like the scouts. That's how naive I was. It wasn't until my den mother,
*  my Cub master, my troop leader all came rushing over and huddled over me with their bodies,
*  these white people, and escorted me out of the danger that I realized I was only target because
*  nobody else was getting this protection. And these were adults or these were other children?
*  It was maybe about five people. I remember there'd be a couple of kids, maybe my age,
*  a year older, and some adults. Adults were throwing rocks and bottles at a 10-year-old boy.
*  That's correct. Yeah. Wow. And I kept saying to my scout leaders, I didn't do anything,
*  I didn't do anything, because now I'm trying to find out what did I do? Why are they doing this
*  to me? And they kept shushing me, telling me to hurry up and move along, it'll be okay. So they
*  never answered the question as to why this was happening. When I got home that day after this
*  parade, my mother and father who were not there were putting the cura chrome and band-aids on me
*  and asking me how did I fall down and get all scraped up. I told them I didn't fall down. I
*  told them exactly what had happened. And for the first time in my life, my mom and dad sat me down
*  and explained to me what racism was. At the age of 10, I had never heard the term racism.
*  What year was this? 1968. Okay. I'll tell you why. Because my dad was a U.S. Foreign Service,
*  so we spent a lot of time overseas. Every two years, you go to a country, you're there for two
*  years, come back home for a few months, and then you get reassigned to another country. So when I
*  was overseas in elementary school, my classes were filled with kids from all over the world.
*  Anybody who had an embassy in those countries, all those embassy kids, went to the same school. My
*  class was full of kids from Nigeria, Italy, France, Germany, Japan, Russia, you name it. If you were
*  to open the door to my classroom and stick your head in, you would say this looks like the United
*  Nations of little kids, because that's exactly what it was. And we all got along. Then I would
*  come home after that two-year assignment, and I would be in either all black schools or all white
*  schools. I'm sorry, all black schools or all black and white schools, meaning the still segregated
*  or the newly integrated schools. And there was not the amount of diversity in my classroom that I
*  had overseas. Today you walk into a classroom, you know, you can't tell where people are from,
*  from all over. So literally, between 1961 and like 1968, 1970, I was living about 12 years into the
*  future when I was living overseas, because that multicultural scene had yet to come to this country.
*  And when it did, of course, I was already prepared. Unfortunately, many of my peers were not. So I
*  didn't experience racism. Had I lived here my whole life, I might have had a different perspective
*  and not taken this path. So I was very curious about it and fascinated with it. Like, how can
*  somebody hate you when they don't even know you? It was just beyond my comprehension. And I knew
*  something was wrong, because the people who did this to me did not look any different than my little
*  French friends, my Swedish friends, or my fellow Americans from the embassy, or for that matter,
*  my fellow Americans right there, you know, at the school where I went where we did the march.
*  So I knew it wasn't a color thing. In fact, when my parents told me this, I did not believe my
*  parents. I thought for some reason, my parents are lying to me, because my 10 year old brain
*  could not process the idea that someone who had never seen me, had never spoken to me, knew nothing
*  about me, would want to inflict pain upon me for no other reason than the color of my skin.
*  So I did not believe them. Well, a month and a half later, that same year, 1968, on April the 4th,
*  Martin Luther King was assassinated. And I remember it very well. We were in Massachusetts, same place,
*  and nearby Boston, Washington, DC, my hometown, Chicago, Illinois, Philadelphia, Detroit,
*  Baltimore, Richmond, LA, all burned to the ground with violence and destruction, all in the name of
*  this new word that I had learned called racism. And so then I realized, my parents had told me
*  the truth, this phenomenon called racism does exist, but why? I don't understand why. Okay,
*  so it's here, but why? And so that's when I formed that question. How can you hate me when you don't
*  even know me? And so I've been looking for the answer to that question now for 51 years. I'm 61
*  years old. So after I met this Klansman show, maybe, I don't know, three or four months later,
*  I quit that band and went back to playing rock and roll and blues and R&B. And then it dawned on me,
*  Darrell, the answer that you've been seeking since age 10 fell right into your lap.
*  Who better to ask that question of how can you hate me when you don't even know me than to ask
*  it of somebody who would go so far as to join an organization whose whole premise has been hating
*  people who do not look like them and who do not believe as they believe. And this organization
*  has been around for over 100 years. Somebody who would go that far to join the KKK should damn
*  sure have an answer to your question. So get back in contact with that guy. And why don't you write
*  a book? Because I had every book, I still do, every book written on the Klan. And they all were written
*  by white authors, obviously, because a white author would have less fear of ramifications,
*  talking to a Klansman or interviewing them, who have easier access or could join the Klan under
*  cover, get the story, get out and write about it. So my book became the first book ever written by
*  a black author on the Ku Klux Klan from the perspective of sitting down face to face. I
*  decided I would go around the country, interview Klan leaders there in Maryland, where I live,
*  up north, down south, Midwest and West. And I said I would start right there in Maryland.
*  So I got a hold of that guy. And I wanted him to introduce me to the Klan leader from Maryland.
*  What was his reaction? When I told him I-
*  Do you mind grabbing the microphone and just pull it closer to you?
*  Sure. Okay.
*  Perfect. What was his reaction when you called up and said, hey, I want to know
*  what makes you guys tick? Like, why are you doing this?
*  Well, actually, it's a little funnier than that. I found the guy's number,
*  from the bar, from the Silver Dollar Lounge. And I called it, this is like months later,
*  and it had been disconnected. So I had to track him down. It turned out he had moved,
*  he didn't have a phone, but I was able to get an address. And so I had no way of letting him know
*  I'm going to come over and talk to you. So I showed up at his apartment one evening and knocked on
*  the door. And I hadn't seen the guy in a while, right? He opens the door and sees me, he goes,
*  Darrell, you know, what are you doing here? And he steps out into the hallway and lifts up
*  and down the hallway to see if I brought anybody with me. And when he stepped out of his apartment,
*  I stepped in. So he turned around, he comes back in. He goes, what's going on? Are you still playing?
*  What's going on? I said, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm playing. But I need to talk to you about the clan.
*  He says, the clan? I said, yeah, you remember, right? He goes, well, I was, but I quit. And he
*  went into this long dissertation as to why he quit the clan. So long story short,
*  I said, I want to meet the clan leader.
*  Did he quit the clan because of his interaction with you?
*  No, not no. Actually, he lied to me. Yes, he was no longer in the clan. But what happened was,
*  he said he quit because he didn't like their ideology. I later found out
*  in my research that, and I got this from the guy who banished him, the leader of that particular
*  clan group. Banished? Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's their term. They banish you. Okay, so every year,
*  clan groups, first of all, let me explain the hierarchy of the clan. Okay. Today, there is no
*  such thing as the Ku Klux Klan. All right. There used to be. Today, there are many Ku Klux Klan
*  groups, and they all are autonomous. They use the same name, Ku Klux Klan. You might have the Dixie
*  Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, the Confederate Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, the Rebel Knights,
*  on and on and on. These are all separate Ku Klux Klan groups. They believe in the same ideology.
*  They wear the same colors on their robes that designate their rank. They have the same secret
*  handshake. What's the secret handshake? Just in case. I'll show it to you. Do it later? Yeah,
*  we'll do it later. Oh, we can't tell people in case somebody shakes their hand they don't even know?
*  I can't reveal clan secrets. Oh, okay. Serious stuff. Oh, yeah. Same passwords, everything.
*  They have passwords? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hilarious. And understand, the clan was formed in 1865.
*  At the end of the Civil War. And it was formed by six Confederate soldiers
*  who were of Irish and Scottish descent. And what they did was they borrowed the rituals,
*  or similar rituals and names and mystery from the Scottish Rite, the Masons, you know, grandness,
*  and all that kind of stuff. Wizards and shit. Exactly. Precisely. Don't they have dragons?
*  Yep. Yep. Okay. So here's how the hierarchy works. All right. So like I said, over the years,
*  Central split apart into different splinter groups of clan. So, and they're all arrivals
*  with each other. If you see a couple different clan groups out in public, they will hold a,
*  you know, unified front. But behind closed doors, they don't like each other.
*  Really? Yeah. You know, we're a real clan. You know, they're a wannabe clan. That kind of thing.
*  A lot of competition kind of thing. Because they may have been in the same clan at one time,
*  and something happened. Somebody embezzled some clandestine or didn't get promoted,
*  you know, whatever. So anyway, if you have a chapter of your particular clan group
*  in another state or in multiple states, you may then consider yourself or your group to be a
*  national clan group. Therefore, you must have a national leader who oversees all the states in
*  which you have a chapter of your particular group. So we call our national leader the president.
*  In clan terminology, that person is known as the imperial wizard. Anybody who is prefixed with the
*  word imperial means that person is a national officer, wizard being the top. All right. So
*  imperial wizard would be like a president and imperial clayliff would be like a vice president.
*  And you have secretaries, treasurers, whole nine yards. And then the next level down would be
*  state, the head of the state, which we call the governor. That person is known as a grand dragon.
*  Anybody grand is on the state level, state officer, dragon being the top governor. A grand clayliff
*  would be like a lieutenant governor and then secretary treasurer. And then within the state,
*  you have counties. The county leader is known as the great titan. Anybody on the great level
*  is on the county level. Within the county, you have districts, what they call clavirons,
*  and we would call a district leader a mayor, a councilman, alderman. That individual is known
*  as an exalted cyclops. So- Exalted cyclops. So if you would address them, you would say,
*  sir, exalted cyclops. Wow, that's hilarious. So anyway-
*  Why cyclops? That's the name they chose. I mean, when you think of a cyclops,
*  think of one of those guys with one eye in the forehead. Yeah. But they have all these different
*  names. And the middle of the cyclops are just rank and file, playing white robe, clansman,
*  clanswoman. So I wanted to meet the- I'll start in Maryland where I live. I want to start with
*  the clan leader from Maryland. Now you could have several different clan groups in the same state,
*  and they are rivals with each other. And you can have chapters of those same clans within your
*  state. So this guy named Roger Kelly was the grand dragon for the state of Maryland for this guy's
*  clan group. And Roger Kelly at the time had the largest clan group in Maryland.
*  How many members? They don't give out numbers, but Roger had probably just over 200,
*  which is a very high number for that time period. Some clan groups only have 10 members.
*  Some, they have an internet presence, but it's only one guy sitting in his basement,
*  putting out something. But anyway, this guy, I want him to introduce me to Roger Kelly. I want
*  Roger to be my first interview. And he was terrified. He said, no, I can't do it, Darrell.
*  We both will get in trouble. I said, but you're not in the clan anymore. He said, it doesn't matter.
*  I cannot take a black man to the grand dragon. So he was concerned genuinely for my safety,
*  as well as his own. And I said, well, look, why don't you give me Mr. Kelly's address and phone
*  number? And I will go to his house and talk to him. And he would not do that. I begged and pleaded
*  for 20 minutes. He finally gave me Mr. Kelly's address and phone number. On the condition
*  that I not tell Mr. Kelly where I got it. And I said, okay. And then he warned me, he said, Darrell.
*  Well, that guy could crack under pressure.
*  Yeah. Oh yeah. Oh, I want to tell you why he got banished.
*  Okay.
*  But that's coming later.
*  Okay. He warned you?
*  Yeah, he warned me. And he said, Darrell, do not go to Roger Kelly's house. He'll kill you.
*  And then he said, there's a bar up in Thurmont, Maryland. Now, you know Thurmont, Maryland.
*  You don't know it for the clan, but that was one of their headquarters. You know Thurmont,
*  Maryland, because it's also the home of Camp David, the presidential retreat.
*  And the headquarters for the clan is right down the road.
*  That's hilarious.
*  Yeah. And Thurmont at the time was an all white town. Any time a black person moved in
*  or interracial couple or a gay couple, somehow mysteriously, a cross would be
*  burned in the yard and boom, they'd move right out. Now that does not mean that every person in
*  Thurmont is in the clan because they're not. In fact, most white people up there wanted the clan
*  gone, but that's where it was headquartered. So he said, there's a bar up there where they hang
*  out every Saturday night. And if I go to that bar, I'm sure to find Roger Kelly. Unless they're
*  out of town rallying somewhere. He says, but I don't guarantee you that Roger will even talk to
*  you, but you're safer to approach him in a public place than go on his property.
*  Did he give you a photograph of him? How'd you find him?
*  No, no. I knew what Roger Kelly looked like because he was always in the newspaper, on the news,
*  being interviewed, something like that. I never met him, but I knew his image.
*  So he drew me a little map how to get to this place. And so it's on Saturday night.
*  Let me turn that thing off. And he says, do not approach him on his own property. I said, all
*  right. So I'm a musician. I'm working Saturday nights. I can't go chasing the clan on Saturday
*  nights. Just a hobby. Yeah. So at that point it was a full-time profession. I called my secretary
*  who books my band. I said, you know, do I have any Sundays off? I figured Sunday is still part of
*  the weekend. Maybe he hangs out there on Sunday too. So she found me a couple of Sundays. And I
*  said, okay, I'm going to go find this Roger Kelly guy. She was, well, I want to go with you. Now,
*  here's the problem. She's white. Not that I have a problem with that. But a black man with a white
*  woman walking into a clan bar. Right. Could be more of a problem. Yeah. You might find them
*  sooner than you want. So I said, you know, Mary, and she said, no, no, I want to go. I said, all
*  right, you know, you've got your own risk. She said, all right. So we drove up there this particular
*  Sunday evening. It was about an hour and a half from my house. And my guy gave me perfect directions.
*  There's the place right there. Boom. We locked the car, walk up these little steps. And I told her,
*  I said, look, I'm going to walk in first. You walk right in behind me. If I turn around and face you,
*  start running and I'll be behind you. And she says, all right, let's go. So we walk in
*  about 7 30 on a Sunday evening. Place was practically empty. I would say maybe no more
*  than six or seven people in there. A couple of guys in the back playing pool, a guy or two sitting
*  at the bar. And the guy had told me this was a Klan bar. And what he meant by Klan bar is the Klan
*  doesn't own it, but that's where they hang out. And he described it to me that when you walk in the
*  door to your left will be a row of booths. And the first two booths closest to the door where you come
*  in are reserved for the Klan. So I looked over there and nobody was sitting there. So I'm looking
*  around, see if I recognize Roger Kelly. And I didn't see anybody who looked like him, which did
*  not mean that some of these people weren't Klan. But I figured, you know what, and to my right was
*  a long bar. Behind the bar was a mirror. And scotch taped to the mirror was a picture,
*  an article from the Washington Post newspaper had a picture of Roger Kelly. They'd interviewed him
*  about something. The NAACP was suing them over some kind of cross burning ceremony or something.
*  And I recognized the article. I said, wow, and there's a big Confederate flag on the back wall
*  like you have the US flag right there. So I knew I was in the right place, or the wrong place,
*  pretty funny how you want to look at it. So I didn't see anybody who looked like Roger Kelly.
*  I figured, you know, I drove an hour and a half to get up here. I don't want to
*  go home empty handed. But I didn't want to just walk up to somebody and say, hey, excuse me,
*  sir, are you in the Klan? So I said, you know, Mary and I are standing in the middle of this bar,
*  basically looking stupid and not knowing what to do. So I said, come on, Mary, let's go over there
*  and sit in one of those first two booths. Because if the Klan is in here, they will come to us.
*  And then we'll know. And then we can ask them, hey, you know, we want to see Roger Kelly.
*  So we went over there and we sat down. Nobody bothered us. Everything was cool. Eventually,
*  we migrated over to the bar. I chatted up the guy sitting next to me like I was lost in some
*  directions. Very nice. Gave me directions. We failed. So we left. The next morning, Mary worked
*  out of my house. I gave her Roger Kelly's number Monday morning. I said, give him a call. I said,
*  tell him that you're working for somebody who's writing a book on the Klan. Would he consent
*  to sitting down with your boss and giving him an interview? However, do not tell Mr. Kelly
*  that I'm black. If he asks, you know, don't lie to him, but don't allude to it. Don't give him
*  reason to. He'll be curious. She understood. And the reason why I did not want him to know that
*  was A, I figured, you know, if he knew that, he meant I give me the interview. But if he agreed
*  to do the interview, then obviously he would see that I'm black when he meets me. And he could
*  decide right then and there if he wants to continue it or not. But I want him to see me first.
*  Secondly, if he agreed to do the interview knowing that I was black, he may have different answers
*  prepared in the interim than he would have for a white interviewer as opposed to a black interviewer.
*  I want to be spontaneous candid. So she understood and she called him and he agreed to do the
*  interview. So we set it up for the motel above the Silver Dollar Lounge up there in Frederick,
*  Maryland at 515 on a Sunday afternoon. And Mary and I got there several hours early.
*  I gave her some money, sent her down the hall to get us some soda pop out of the machine,
*  put it in the ice bucket, fill it with ice, get it all cold. So, you know, I could offer
*  Mr. Kelly a beverage, a cold beverage. I had no idea what this man would do
*  once he laid eyes on me and saw that I was black. Would he come in the room? Would he attack me?
*  Would he walk away? You know, but in the event, I wanted to be hospitable. So she got the soda pop,
*  put an ice bucket set on the dresser. Now, just by happenstance, the way the room is laid out,
*  if you are standing in the hallway, in the doorway of the room, looking into the room,
*  you cannot see who's in the room. You have to literally walk in the door and turn to your right
*  and the room is laid out back there. So there's no way you can know who's in the room standing in
*  the hallway. And so I took advantage of that. I took the lamp table, took the lamp off and put it
*  in the most obscure corner of the room. I put a chair on one side for me and a chair on the other
*  side for Mr. Kelly. And I had a little bag beside me, a little like duffel bag. And in my bag,
*  I had a cassette recorder, blank cassette tapes, and a copy of the Bible because the Ku Klux Klan
*  claims to be a Christian organization. And they claim that the Bible preaches racial separation.
*  Now, I've read through the Bible. I've never seen that in there. So I want to be able to pull out my
*  Bible when he brings it up and say, here, Mr. Kelly, show me please in this King James Version,
*  chapter and verse, where it says blacks and whites must be separate. So I'm all prepared, right?
*  Right on time at 515, knock on the door. I'm seated there where you can't see me until you
*  come in the room. Mary hops up and, by the way, Mary's white, as I mentioned before. So she goes
*  around the corner, opens the door, in walks what is known as the Grand Nighthawk. Nighthawk in
*  Klan terminology means bodyguard, security. So a Grand Nighthawk would be a bodyguard.
*  Their names are so ridiculous, cyclopses, dragons and wizards and nighthawks.
*  Oh, it goes on and on. It goes on and on.
*  Of course it does.
*  A grand clud, a grand clavey, grand magi, all kinds of stuff. Anyway, so the Grand Nighthawk,
*  which means bodyguard to the grand dragon, like an Imperial Nighthawk,
*  means bodyguard to the Imperial wizard, in walks this Grand Nighthawk. He's wearing military
*  camouflage. And on one side of his chest is that Klan emblem, that red circle, white cross, blood
*  drop. On the other side are the initials KKK. Embroidered on his beret is the Knights of the
*  Ku Klux Klan. And on his hip he has a semi-automatic handgun and a holster. He comes in
*  and Mr. Kelly is walking directly behind him in a dark blue suit and tie. And when the Nighthawk
*  turned the corner and saw me, he just froze. And Mr. Kelly did not realize that his Nighthawk had
*  stopped short and he slammed into his back and knocked him forward. And so they're stumbling
*  around regaining their balance and looking all around the room. And I'm just watching them.
*  And I could see the apprehension in their faces. I could read it. They were thinking,
*  did the desk clerk give us the right room number? Or is this an ambush and what's going on here?
*  So I stood up and I displayed the palms of my hands as to say, hey, I'm unarmed. And I walked
*  forward. I stuck out my right hand. I said, hi, Mr. Kelly, I'm Darrell Davis. And he shook my hand.
*  He shook my hand and the Nighthawk shook my hand. So, so far so good. I'm doing well. I said,
*  come on in, come on in, have a seat, please. Mr. Kelly sat down even better. And the Nighthawk
*  stood at attention that Mr. Kelly's right. So I'm going to sit down opposite of him, right?
*  And Mr. Kelly says to me, Mr. Davis, do you have any form of identification? I said, sure.
*  I produced my wallet and I handed him my driver's license. He looked at it and he goes, oh,
*  you live on 2nd Street in Silver Spring. Now this had me a little concerned. Why is this man
*  reading my street address? All he has to do is look at my name, look at my picture,
*  match it up to me and give me back my license. Here he is, I'm looking at my address.
*  Is he going to come burn across on my lawn? What's up? So I did not want to let him know that he had
*  unnerved me a little bit, but I wanted to let him know under no circumstances are you to come
*  to my house uninvited with any nefarious intentions. So I said to him, I said, yes, Mr. Kelly,
*  that is where I live and you live at. And I named his house number and his street that the
*  former guy gave me. That way I was implying, hey, you know where I live? I know where you live.
*  If you come visit me, I'm going to come visit you. So we're going to confine all this visiting to
*  this motel room. So he smiled, he nodded his head like he understood. And I did not find out that
*  day. It was several months down the road that I had been presumptuous. I had no reason to fear,
*  Mr. Kelly, coming to my house to do anything stupid. What had happened was one of his clan members
*  lived right down the road from me. I didn't know that. And Mr. Kelly would have to travel down my
*  street to get into that neighborhood where this clan member lived. He simply recognized the name
*  of the street. That was it. Pure coincidence. So he wasn't trying to threaten you? No, not at all.
*  And today that same clan member is in a federal prison. He'll be there for a long time. He would
*  later commit a hate crime, which landed him in the federal penitentiary. So anyway, we got on
*  with this interview. And within 10 minutes, Mr. Kelly let me know why he could hate people like
*  me. Black people are inferior. We are prone to crime. We're criminals. That is why there are more
*  blacks in prison than whites. Now, that's a half truth. There are indeed more blacks in prison than
*  white people. It's not because we're prone to crime, like you said. It's because of inequity
*  in our judicial system where whites in the same predicament either don't get the same jail time
*  or don't go to jail or whatever. Anyway, so I'm a criminal. I also said that black people are lazy.
*  We don't want to work. While we prefer to scam the government welfare system, we're looking for
*  handouts and freebies and all that where white people, they work, etc. And also, this book called
*  The Bell Curve had just recently come out. Charles Murray. Yeah, you know the one. Yeah,
*  very controversial book. Exactly. So he had jumped on that and he said, well, you know, it's a known
*  fact. You know, they say the world's biggest authority is they. You know, you never see who
*  they is, right? They say that, you know, black people have smaller brains than white people.
*  And that's why their IQ is not as high. So I guess the bigger the brain, the more intelligent you are.
*  So now I'm sitting there listening to this guy tell me that I'm a criminal and I'm lazy and on
*  welfare and my brain is smaller than his. What he was saying was indeed offensive.
*  But here's the difference between me and most other people. I did not take offense to it.
*  I tell you why I got to take offense to it. Why should I be offended by somebody who knows
*  nothing about me? He only met me 10 minutes ago. He sees the color of my skin and has made this
*  assessment. So why should I take offense to somebody who's telling a lie? I just let him
*  roll along with it. Where did you develop this kind of clarity? It's very unusual to not be offended
*  when someone's judging you instantly and saying disparaging things about everyone that looks
*  anything like you just right off the cuff, freely right in front of you. How did you develop this
*  clarity to just not be offended by that? Because it didn't make sense what he was saying. Of course.
*  So I figured, how can I be offended by somebody who's all twisted? Who obviously doesn't have
*  the foresight to see that he's wrong? I want to learn more about this, where it's coming from.
*  And so now see, that's what usually stops a conversation and then people get into combat.
*  And then it goes nowhere. So I was not offended by it, so let him roll along with it. And then when
*  he finished, and he was proud of him explaining to me why the stance. So, Mr. Kelly, I'm going
*  to be straight up with you. I don't have a criminal record. I have never been on welfare.
*  I've never measured my brain, but I'm sure it's the same size as anybody else's.
*  And he's, whatever, and we go on. Well, every now and then the cassette would run out of tape,
*  right? And I'd reach down into my bag and pull out a fresh cassette. Or Mr. Kelly would pound
*  the table. Mr. Davis, the Bible says, I'd reach down, pull out the Bible. Every time I'd reach
*  down like this to get the Bible or the cassette out of the bag, the Nighthawk would reach up onto
*  his hip. Right? Now, that was cool. I mean, I got that. That's his job. His job is to protect his
*  boss. He has no idea what's in my bag. That's a little distracting though, isn't it?
*  Well, yeah. But, you know, I realize that these people are afraid of me.
*  Right. Okay. So, you know, I have to be cool. I'm not afraid of them.
*  Right. So I have to be cool, but be transparent. All right? So, you know, he's doing his job.
*  And just like, you know, when you get pulled over, well, you know, maybe you don't get pulled over
*  as much as I do, right, by the cops at night. But, you know, I can tell you right now, you know,
*  when you get pulled over and a cop tells you to get your license or whatever, and it's in the glove
*  box, and you reach, he gets a little more tighter on his hand. You know, he's protecting himself.
*  So the Nighthawk was doing that. And I got that. So, you know, this kept happening. And after a
*  while, he realized there was no threat in the bag. And I went in and out of the bag. Nighthawk
*  didn't move. He was relaxed. Just over an hour into this interview, there was a sudden, a very
*  quick, I mean, less than a second noise in the room. It went shh, like that. That was it.
*  And it happened so fast out of nowhere that my ear could not discern what it was.
*  It just came out of the blue. And I'm sitting closer than you and I are right now,
*  because the table was smaller, to Mr. Kelly. And the Nighthawk was here. And Mr. Kelly's right
*  there. And I flew up out of my chair and hit the table. Because my ear could not discern what the
*  noise was, I perceived it to be an ominous, threatening noise. And I knew, I knew for a fact
*  that Mr. Kelly had made this noise. Where did it come from? Why did he make it?
*  How did I know that he made it? I knew that because I didn't make it. So, you know, if you
*  don't want to accept responsibility, or you know you're not responsible, what do you do?
*  You assign blame. Right? And so, I flew up out of my chair and hit the table. And my mind was
*  racing. What did I just do? What did I just say to cause Mr. Kelly to go off and make some threatening
*  noise? You know, I instantly put everything in perspective. We're enemies. He's the head of the
*  clan. I'm a black guy. And now, you know, and then I heard that former clansman's voice in my head,
*  Darrell, do not fool with Roger Kelly. He will kill you. So, I didn't want to die. And in that
*  split second, I had gone into survival mode. And when you fear for your life, that's what you do.
*  What was the noise? I'm going to tell you in a second. Yeah, it was just, that was it. And
*  because it was unexpected, and it was so short, I couldn't discern it. You know, I went into self
*  protect mode. And I hit the table. Well, when you fear for your life, as I said, you know,
*  you go into survival mode. And in survival mode, you know, you're only, you can only do like one of
*  four things. Some people, they just pass out, they faint. Because the fear is so great,
*  their brain cannot process it. And it shuts down, and they pass out. Other people, their muscles
*  contract, and they get tense, and they can't move. And you can be punching them, kicking them,
*  and they won't even be deflecting the blows. They're all constricted. That's called paralysis
*  by fear, that you're too afraid to move. The third thing people will do is to run away from
*  whatever the fear is. And that is your best option. When something scares you that bad,
*  take off, separate yourself as quickly as you can from that fear. But as much distance between you
*  and the fear as you can. And that would have been my choice, had it been an option. But it was not
*  an option for me, because you cannot outrun a bullet in a motel room, right? So I was not armed,
*  my secretary was not armed. The only person who I knew for sure who was armed was a Nighthawk.
*  You can see his gun right there. And I didn't know if Mr. Kelly had a weapon up under his suit jacket
*  or not. All I knew was, I don't want to die today. So I chose the fourth option, which was to do a
*  preemptive strike. You get them before they get you. So when I flew out of my chair, I was going
*  to dive across the table. I was going to grab Mr. Kelly, grab the Nighthawk, and slam them down to
*  the ground and take away the Nighthawk's gun. Whoa. No, it was going to happen that quickly.
*  Okay. I think pretty fast, sometimes a little too fast. But I'm glad I hit the table because I'm
*  looking right into his eyes, trying to figure out like, what did you do? I didn't say one word to
*  this guy, but my eyes had locked with his eyes. It's like I could see right through him. And I
*  let my eyes do the talking. I knew he could hear my eyes. My eyes were shouting at him saying,
*  what did you just do? Well, his eyes had fixated on my eyes. He didn't say a word either,
*  but I could read his eyes. His eyes are saying to me, what did you just do?
*  And the Nighthawk had his hand on his gun, looking at both of us like,
*  what did either one of y'all just do? Mary was sitting to my left on top of the dresser
*  because there were no more chairs. And she realized what had happened, and she began explaining it to
*  us. When it happened again, the ice in the ice bucket had begun to melt and the cans shifted
*  down the ice. That was it. Okay. So the tension was so thick that the ice in the bucket wasn't
*  just like a normal, like if there was ice in the bucket right now, it'd be like, oh, it's just noise.
*  You were just on edge. Absolutely. Absolutely. And the cans were just falling down the ice.
*  And you'd been talking for an hour? Yeah. Yeah. And now they've been sitting there
*  before Mr. Kelly came in. Okay. And we'd forgotten about it. I offered him a drink
*  when he first got there, and he said no. But so- What I was going to get to was like,
*  so you're talking to him for an hour, and in that hour is the tension. The tension's not being
*  alleviated at all. He's explaining everything to you. He's telling you his theories. You're
*  being very calm and just letting him speak. Yeah. But you're still so on edge just being across from
*  this guy that that sound- Right, because it came out of nowhere.
*  It came out of nowhere. And I mean, yeah, the tension had de-escalated, all that kind of stuff,
*  as we got more into the hour. But I think we each were aware, this is not a normal situation,
*  a black kind of clan leader. So each one was still a little wary of the other kind of thing.
*  But we were mutually respectful. Okay. So then it happened again, and we began laughing. We began
*  laughing, all of us, at how ignorant we had all been. I won't say that this was a learning moment,
*  but it was a teaching moment. And the learning would come later. What was taught was this.
*  All because some foreign, an underscore highlight circle, the word foreign, entity,
*  of which we were ignorant, that being the bucket of ice cans of soda, entered into our little
*  comfort zone via the noise that it made, we became fearful and accusatory of each other.
*  So the lesson taught is ignorance breeds fear. We fear those things we don't understand.
*  If you do not keep that fear in check, that fear in turn will escalate and breed hatred,
*  because we hate those things that frighten us. If you don't check that hatred, it in turn
*  will escalate and breed destruction. We want to destroy those things that we hate.
*  Why? Because they frighten us. But guess what? They may have been harmless and we were just
*  ignorant. And we saw the whole chain unravel to almost completion, the last component being
*  destruction. It stopped just short of that. Had I pounced across the table and hurt one of them,
*  or had the Nighthawk drawn his gun and shot one of us, that would have been the destruction.
*  Fortunately, that did not happen. We did see that whole chain unravel to completion.
*  Three years ago, on August 12th, 2017, in Charlottesville, Virginia,
*  which is like two hours from my house, on August 12th, 2017, in Charlottesville,
*  Virginia, there was a lot of ignorance in Charlottesville. There was a lot of fear
*  in Charlottesville. There was a lot of hatred in Charlottesville. And what did it culminate in?
*  It culminated in destruction when a white supremacist got inside his vehicle and drove
*  full force into a crowd of counter protesters trying to murder them. He succeeded in injuring
*  20 and murdering a young lady named Heather Heyer. So that whole chain is there. If you
*  want to solve this problem of racism, we need to stop focusing on the symptoms. Don't worry
*  about the fear. Don't worry about the hatred. Those are just symptoms. That's like putting a
*  bandaid on cancer. You've got to go down to the bone and treat it at its source. The source of all
*  this is ignorance. Ignorance can be cured. The cure for ignorance is called education. So you fix
*  the ignorance, there's nothing to fear because you fear what you don't know. When you cure the
*  ignorance, you know something. There's nothing to fear. If there's nothing to fear, then there's
*  nothing to hate. If there's nothing to hate, there's nothing to destroy. So we need to focus
*  on the ignorance and we address it with exposure and education and conversation. We spend way too
*  much time in this country talking about the other person, talking at the other person,
*  talking past the other person. Why not just spend a little bit of time talking with the other person?
*  So, like I said, we carried on with the conversation, had a good time. Nobody got
*  hurt. Everybody laughed. And I thanked them, shook their hands, and they told me to keep in touch.
*  I'm thinking, keep in touch.
*  Pete Slauson You guys are homies now.
*  Yeah. But I did, you know. I called them and said, hey man, I'm playing in your county.
*  Come out and see me.
*  Pete Slauson How long did you guys talk that day?
*  Pete Slauson Oh, maybe, I don't know, two and a half hours,
*  something like that.
*  Pete Slauson Did, at the end, after the ice, did everything sort of loosen up?
*  Pete Slauson Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Pete Slauson So, the laughter and then did the conversation loosen then?
*  Pete Slauson The conversation loosened then. It wasn't like, you know, we all hugged each other.
*  Pete Slauson Did you offer any counter to the things he was saying, like Charles Murray stuff?
*  Pete Slauson Absolutely. Absolutely.
*  Pete Slauson How did he respond to that?
*  Pete Slauson He said, well, you know, I don't know about that. I know that these guys are
*  doctors and da da da da. So, he looks to authority.
*  Pete Slauson Of course.
*  Pete Slauson But of course, if you find authority in the other direction, well, something's wrong
*  with them. So, you take a narrative that fits your narrative. So, like for example –
*  Pete Slauson Confirmation bonds.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah. So, for example,
*  he did bring up that the Bible preaches racial separation and I gave him the Bible. I said,
*  show me where? So, I forgot now the exact chapter and verse, but I think it's in Leviticus.
*  And I'm going to paraphrase. He pointed to this verse and I read it and it said something to the
*  effect of a lamb should not lay with a wolf. I said, well…
*  Pete Slauson If it wants to live.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson What the fuck does that have to do with people?
*  Pete Slauson So, I said, what does that mean, Mr. Kelly? He says, well, it means that two different
*  species should not lay together. I said, hold on. I said, blacks and whites are not two different
*  species. We are the same species, two different colors. Oh, no, no, no, no. We're different
*  species. So, he takes what he wants and twists it to fit the narrative. Okay. So, he – like I said,
*  I thanked him. I began calling him. He'd come up to my gigs. He'd bring the Nighthawk. I'd invite
*  him down to my house. He came down to my house with the Nighthawk. The Nighthawk would sit on my couch
*  next to him. Sometimes, the Nighthawk would get bored, right, and pull out his gun and twirl it
*  on his finger. Yeah, I'm serious. And –
*  Pete Slauson What the fuck?
*  Pete Slauson I felt very comfortable with them, you know, after time. And so, then at that point,
*  I would begin inviting over some of my black friends, some of my Jewish friends, some of my
*  other white friends.
*  Pete Slauson Did you, like, let them know in advance?
*  Pete Slauson Sometimes.
*  Pete Slauson Sometimes not?
*  Pete Slauson Sometimes not, yeah.
*  Pete Slauson Wow! What did they say when they come over and they see a grand wizard and a Nighthawk?
*  Pete Slauson Well –
*  Pete Slauson Or a dragon? Is he a dragon or a wizard?
*  Pete Slauson You know, he was still a dragon at that point.
*  Pete Slauson Okay.
*  Pete Slauson Okay. And sometimes, they freak out. And my band – oh my God, my band. You know,
*  I have a band van, so they're all short in my house. Get in the van, we'll all ride at the gig
*  together, especially if it's far away. And sometimes, I want to stop at some clan rally
*  on my way to a gig. And so, my God, I say, Darrell, I'll tell you what, I'll just meet you there.
*  You know, I'm not going to ride with you.
*  Pete Slauson Jesus Christ.
*  Pete Slauson So, this became a full-time project for you.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, it did.
*  Pete Slauson How quickly did it escalate? So, it went from this – you obviously had some – you
*  were compelled, almost obsessed to meet this guy and get to the bottom of this thing that had been
*  bothering you since you were 10 years old.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah. And because my relationship with him
*  was really growing, it was turning into a friendship. I mean, you know, I'm not going to lie.
*  I genuinely liked this guy. And I could see him beginning to like me a lot. I did not like his
*  ideology. But I saw the humanity in him. And he was seeing the same thing in me. We both want the
*  same things. All right? And I began interviewing a lot of other Klan people from different areas,
*  up north, down south, midwest, etc. Some would talk to me, some would not talk to me,
*  some wanted to fight me. I ran the whole gamut. And I put it all in my book.
*  Now, I would see him for like two years. He'd come into my house or we'd go out and have lunch
*  or dinner together.
*  Pete Slauson Wow.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah. But during those two years, and by the end of the two years,
*  he was coming to my house by himself. He trusted me that much. No nighthawk. You drive on down,
*  right? And by the end of two years, he had not invited me to his house, you know? After two
*  years, he got promoted from our grand dragon state leader to Imperial Wizard national leader.
*  At that point, he began inviting me to his house.
*  Wow.
*  Pete Slauson Now, he was the man in charge, right? So, I'd go to his house. I would see his Klan den,
*  where he'd have his Klan meetings.
*  Pete Slauson They have a den at the house?
*  Pete Slauson Well, yeah, they call it a den. You know, it's a room. You know, it's all set
*  away with a Klan altar and chairs.
*  Pete Slauson What's a Klan altar look like?
*  Pete Slauson It's a table that has a Klan flag across it. It has that big red circle with the
*  white cross and blood drop. And they have candles, things like that, and a cross. And the cross has
*  either candles on it, so it's like a flame, or light bulbs. So, anyway, and a sword,
*  laying across the table. I take pictures, take some notes. And then he began
*  inviting me to Klan rallies.
*  Pete Slauson Oh!
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, yeah. And so, I'd go to these Klan rallies
*  and they'd have this big wooden cross. The wooden cross is wrapped in burlap. The burlap has been
*  soaked in what they call Klan cologne, which is actually diesel fuel, or kerosene. And the Klan
*  men and Klan women are all in their robes and hoods and they have these torches. The torches are
*  lit and they walk in a big wide circle around this cross, which is in the center. And then either the
*  Imperial Wizard or the Grand Dragon will shout, you know, Klan men halt! And they'll all stop in
*  place. Klan men face the cross and they'll all turn in and face the inner circle. And then he'll
*  say, for my God, and they all repeat, for my God and bow. For my race, for my race. For my country,
*  for my country. For my Klan, for my Klan. White power, white power. Klan men approach the cross
*  and they all close in and now they're all right there at the base of the cross.
*  Klan men light the cross and they drop their torches at the foot of the cross and whoosh!
*  This thing is aflame. And they stand there and admire this burning cross. And then they give
*  some speeches from the podium. And then they have hot dogs and hamburgers and the rally is over.
*  You know? And I'm sitting there watching this. I'm taking pictures, taking notes.
*  R. How weird did it feel to be there watching all this?
*  W. It definitely felt different. But, you know, I knew what to expect pretty much.
*  I read all these books. So, you know, I mean, I know that's what they do at Klan rallies. They
*  burn crosses. Now, let me explain something to you that I learned. There are two times,
*  two occasions upon which they set the cross aflame, as they put it. They have a cross burning and a
*  cross lighting. The difference being, a cross burning is when they take a five or ten foot cross
*  wrapped in that burlap soaked in kerosene and put it in your lawn because you're an interracial
*  couple, you're gay, you're Jewish in a white neighborhood, whatever the deal is. That is
*  meant as intimidation. It's a warning. We know who you are. Cease and desist. Move out. If you don't,
*  next time we come, we mean business. In other words, they're going to bomb your house or something.
*  Okay? When they do that, that's called a cross burning. All right? A cross lighting is when they
*  do a 30 or 20 or 30 foot cross at a ceremony and they parade around it and give a lecture.
*  That's called a cross lighting. And that's what you went to. I went to the cross lighting. How
*  often they do those things? As often as they want. Several times a year. What do they talk about,
*  like when they have meetings? The future of the white race and what they want and what the
*  constitution guarantees them. This is a white man's land. This land was built by white people.
*  The constitution was signed by white men. This is their country. Immigration. Whatever the issues
*  are, the browning of America is a big topic. Or white genocide, same thing. When they say
*  white genocide, they mean their race is getting smaller through miscegenation. So, you know,
*  these are the topics that they cover. It's pretty interesting. But check this out though.
*  Our relationship would grow and grow. And eventually, Mr. Kelly,
*  you know, yeah.
*  Oh, Jesus. What do you got there?
*  He began, he began.
*  Give you a robe, say put this on, sneak right in.
*  Yeah. Yeah, he began.
*  Don't take the hood off.
*  Believing.
*  Whoa, that's him right there in that photo with you?
*  That's him right there in his grand dragon robe. This is his imperial wizard robe.
*  Whoa.
*  Right here. And-
*  He gave you his robe?
*  Gave me his robe because he no longer believes in what it stands for.
*  Wow.
*  And how many years did it take?
*  There it is. How many years did it take before you, just by being around him and talking to him?
*  For him, it was probably like around maybe six and a half, seven.
*  Six and a half, seven years.
*  Some, some, it's a matter of months, a matter of a year, two years.
*  And so what do you do? Do you just talk, is that the hat?
*  That's the hood, yeah.
*  Oh, Jesus.
*  And you see, this is, this top part is the hood and this lower portion here,
*  that's what's called the mask. And members who want anonymity,
*  they don't want you to know who they are. They wear this mask which is attached
*  by three snaps or Velcro, just remove it. They don't care and the face is exposed,
*  as you saw in that picture.
*  So what, what is it like? You said you guys got closer.
*  You said you became more and more friends. You started visiting each other.
*  Yeah.
*  Did he ever say, you know, I'm starting to think this is bullshit?
*  Yeah, pretty much.
*  How did he say it?
*  He called me up one day and he told me, I got something I want to talk to you about.
*  And I said, okay. He goes, you want to meet for dinner? I said, sure.
*  So I drove to Frederick and met him and he sat me down and he said, you know,
*  I'm quitting the Klan. I'm leaving it.
*  And he's the top dog.
*  The top dog. He gave it all up. And here's the thing. He did a smart thing. He did a good thing.
*  He didn't hand it down. He shut it down.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah. You know.
*  Did he convince the other people in the Klan that?
*  Well, they had the choice to do whatever they wanted to do.
*  Right.
*  A lot of them left. A lot of them left as well. Then there were those who tried to
*  keep it going, but you know, but failed.
*  Did he use you as an example when he was speaking to them?
*  They knew why he did it. He received some hate mail. He began receiving some hate mail
*  from some of his own members anonymously. The same kind of hate mail that at one time he would
*  send out to people anonymous would now come back to him. You know, you're in bed with Darryl Davis.
*  You're a nigger lover. All that kind of stuff. Unsigned. You know, the same stuff that he would
*  put out to other people. And so he began seeing himself in the mirror. You understand?
*  Mmm.
*  So that was very crucial. And I have repeated this process many times with different people.
*  What is the process? When you're talking about the Charles Murray stuff, the bell curve stuff,
*  how do you refute that? What are you saying to him?
*  I'm saying to him, look, Mr. Murray, anytime you want to prove something, you find something that
*  fits your narrative. You can find some black person who has a very low IQ. If I work for Ford
*  and I want to prove that my car is better than Chevrolet, then I'm going to find a Chevrolet
*  that doesn't run very well. I'm going to do it that way. So I refuted Mr. Murray's and his
*  partner, the two guys who wrote the book, their documentation. And see, they go by things that
*  they can see and understand. I'm going to give you an example of something that's going to
*  help you understand. This cyclops was riding around in my car one day with me. He's sitting
*  in my passenger seat, right? And we're driving. I'm driving along. And somehow we got on the topic
*  of black crime. And he made a statement. He said, well, you know, we all know, they say that,
*  again, that they authority say that black people have a gene in them that makes them violent.
*  And I'd heard that before from other clan people. That's one of their narratives. And, you know,
*  the wild black savage kind of thing. And I said, what are you talking about? He says, well,
*  who's doing all the drive-bys and carjackings in Southeast? He was referring to Southeast
*  Washington, D.C., which is a predominantly black area. Some whites live there. It's predominantly
*  black, very high crime ridden. I said, okay, it's black people. I said, but that's what lives there.
*  I said, who's doing all the crime in Bangor, Maine? White people, because that's what lives there.
*  I said, you know, you're not even considering the demographics. He's like, no, no, no, no,
*  you all have this gene and blah, blah, blah. So, you know, he's going to shut me down. And I said,
*  look, he's right here. I said, look, I'm as black as anybody you know. I said, I have never
*  done a drive-by. I have never done a carjacking. How do you explain that? This man did not wait
*  one second. He answered me like that. He said, your genus latent hasn't come out yet.
*  How do you argue with somebody who's that far in the field, right? I mean, you can't even bite
*  into that and chew on it, right? So I'm dumbfounded and I'm speechless. I'm just driving along. He's
*  over here all smug, you see, nothing to say. So I thought about it. And I said, you know,
*  I used his authority. I said, they say that all white people have a gene that makes them a serial
*  killer. He's like, how do you figure that? I said, name me three black serial killers.
*  He couldn't do it. I said, here, I'm going to give you one. I named one for him. I said, here,
*  just name me two. He couldn't do it. I said, Charles Manson, Jeffrey Dahlmer, Henry Lee Lucas,
*  John Wayne Gacy, Albert DeSalvo, the Boston Strangler, Ted Bundy, David Berkowitz, son of Sam.
*  Ed Gein, Henry Lee Lucas.
*  Ed Gein, right. Ed Gein and his crazy machines, the skin people. Okay. I said, son, they're all
*  white. You're a serial killer. Yeah. And he said, well, I've never killed anybody. I said,
*  your genus latent hasn't come out yet. He goes, well, that's stupid. I said, well, duh.
*  I said, you're right. It is stupid. I said, but it's no more stupid for me to say that about you
*  than what you said about me. And he got very quiet. But I mean, you could almost see it, Joe.
*  His wheels were spinning. And he's thinking about it. And then he changed the subject.
*  But within four or five months, he left the Klan based on that conversation. And his robe
*  was the very first robe I ever got.
*  Wow. So he came to you and gave you the robe. He said that conversation with you.
*  Well, first he said, no, he didn't come to me and give me the robe. He called me. And I was going
*  to be up in that area. And he said, you want to get together? And I got together with him.
*  And he wanted to go over to the courthouse for something. He'd been in some kind of trouble.
*  He wanted to go pick up something from the courthouse. So I gave him a ride over there.
*  And he told me he was going to quit the Klan. And he thought a lot about what I'd said. And I said,
*  what are you going to do with your stuff? He said, trash it. I said, no, don't trash it.
*  I said, give it to me. He says, you want my robe and all my Klan stuff? And I said, yeah.
*  He goes, why? Why would you want that? I didn't know why. But something told me,
*  just take it, Darrell. Just take it. And I said, I don't know what I'm going to do with it. But I
*  said, yeah, I do want it. So we went back to his apartment. Now, I'd never been in his apartment
*  because I'd met him outside, outside in the driveway or whatever, a parking lot. And he said,
*  come on in. And so I'm walking up the stairs with him to the apartment. I'm thinking,
*  you know, I hope I'm not getting set up here. But I walked on in and his fiance was sitting on the
*  couch, Klan's woman. I'd seen her before. And I sat down and talked with her. And he went down
*  the hall to his room. And he came back. He got a hefty trash bag, went back there again, and came
*  back with this trash bag all loaded up. Had his robe, his hood, Klan belt buckle.
*  Trevor Burrus They have a Klan belt buckle?
*  Darrell Bock Oh, yeah. They got Klan tie clips, all kinds of stuff, man. And his certificate of
*  membership, all kinds of stuff in this bag and gave it to me. And I said, OK, thank you, you know.
*  And I didn't know why I wanted it, but I just knew I should have it. Well, first of all,
*  it's history, OK? And you don't destroy history. The good, the bad, the ugly, and the shameful.
*  It's still American history. And the KKK, I've said it before, is as American as baseball,
*  apple pie, and Chevrolet. It's a shameful part of our history. But it is our history nonetheless.
*  Now I know what I'm doing with stuff. I got my 501C3. I'm going to have a museum one day
*  and put all this stuff in there. Trevor Burrus
*  Wow. What's a 501C3? Is that…
*  Darrell Bock It makes you tax exempt.
*  Trevor Burrus Oh.
*  Darrell Bock Yeah.
*  Trevor Burrus KKK Conversion Museum.
*  Darrell Bock Yeah, yeah.
*  Trevor Burrus You're going to have pictures of you with the dudes right next to the robe in each one?
*  Darrell Bock Oh, yeah.
*  Trevor Burrus Oh, that's amazing.
*  Darrell Bock Most of them. Most of them I do. And so I began collecting all this kind of stuff.
*  This is, well, here, let me show you this one. This is a grand dragon robe. Green is the sign
*  for the grand dragon. And there you go. Got the little Confederate flags here, you know,
*  clan patches. Trevor Burrus
*  Whose is that? Who gave you that? Darrell Bock
*  This guy. Bob White. Robert White. Robert White used to be the grand dragon of Maryland
*  for another clan group, which was a rival to Roger Kelly's group. All right? When I first heard of
*  Bob White, I was in my late teens, and I heard about him on the news. He had been busted, arrested,
*  and put in jail for conspiring to bomb a synagogue in Baltimore upon Liberty Road, the Liberty Road
*  synagogue. And he was convicted. He went to prison for four years. This is before I started writing
*  the book. I just remembered him. And then he got out after doing his time, continued running the
*  clan, and then some years later, he got busted again. Assault with intent to murder, two black
*  men with a shotgun. All right? Now understand something. As a clan leader, you don't make
*  any money, or not a lot, unless you're embezzling money from the dues. And a lot of people do that.
*  That's what causes these splinter groups. If you're a leader like a wizard or dragon,
*  you might get like a small stipend out of the dues, but not enough to pay your rent or put
*  food on your table. So you have to have a regular job. Cyclops, wizard, dragon, whatever, these are
*  all just titles. Like Boy Scout leader, you have to have a regular job to pay your rent and mortgage.
*  This man's regular job when he was doing all this nonsense, bombing places and stuff,
*  Baltimore City Police Officer. This is his police officer uniform. He was not an undercover cop in
*  the clan gathering intelligence. He was a bona fide clansman on the Baltimore City Police Force.
*  Okay? And there are more. There are more. Okay? But he went on... This guy was vehemently, vehemently
*  anti-Semitic and racist and very, very violent. But he went on to become one of my best friends.
*  And he gave me his clan robe, gave me his police uniform. I do a lot of lecturing all over the
*  country and stuff. Did he quit the police force? He was forced to quit the police force or be fired.
*  The police force, Baltimore City Police Force, even just last year, they had a consent decree
*  from the Department of Justice against them. They are very racist and very corrupt.
*  What they would do is they would turn a blind eye to the clansman on the force. Because as a police
*  officer, you're not allowed to belong to any subversive groups. They would turn a blind eye
*  as long as the guys would not bring unwarranted attention to the department. Just keep your stuff,
*  whatever. Well, he would end up getting busted for planting a bomb near a synagogue
*  and firing a shotgun and all that kind of stuff at black people. So they gave him,
*  hey, you got to retire or we put off the force. You're causing us too much publicity.
*  This is before he left the clan. So what did he do after he did that?
*  He had to get another job while he was still in the clan.
*  He got another job. He began dealing in the homing pigeons.
*  Dude, these people have to work, man.
*  Harkaic, ridiculous way to transmit information. It's perfect for someone who's in something like
*  the clan. But you have to work. I'll tell you something though. Not all of them, in fact,
*  probably not most of them. But some of the hardest working people that I've ever seen in my life
*  have been in the clan. I'm serious. Working hard to make a living and support their families.
*  Is there a universal factor when you talk about how they got involved in it? Is it the neighborhood?
*  Is it people that they knew or family?
*  Well, let me give you an example of why people join the clan. There are different reasons.
*  In some cases, it's my grandfather was in the clan, my daddy was in the clan, so I'm in the
*  clan and my kids are going to be in the clan. It's a family tradition, right? Passed down.
*  When you are dealing with somebody with that kind of tie, that generational thing,
*  it may take a little longer for them to come out because it's hard to break family tradition.
*  Another reason why people join, you take a depressed town like a coal mining town
*  in West Virginia or Scranton, Pennsylvania, something like that, where people who are not
*  racist, they're hard workers, they dig coal all their lives. Grandfather dug coal, father dug coal,
*  now you dug coal, dig coal after high school. It's all you know. If I were to hand one of those
*  people a vacuum cleaner and say vacuum this rug, they wouldn't know how to do it. All they know is
*  digging coal and they're happy. They're making their paycheck, they're feeding their family,
*  paying their rent, whatever. They're not concerned about people's color, they're happy.
*  But then the company gets greedy and decides, hey, you know what? We can save money, make a lot
*  more money if we lay off our employees and hire some of these immigrants, whether they're legal
*  or illegal, because they'll work for less than half of what we're paying our people.
*  They lay off these people and hire these people who just came over to the country looking for work.
*  They pay them next to nothing. Now these white people who are never racist are out of a job.
*  The bank is going to foreclose on their trailer or their house or whatever.
*  They can't put food on their table. The Klan sees these things and the Klan will come into a
*  depressed town like that and hold a rally and say, the blacks have the NAACP, the Jews have the ADL.
*  You know, nobody stands up for the white man but the Klan. Come join us, we'll get your job back.
*  You know, that was your job. Your job's not gone, but you're gone. And now some nigger or some
*  spick's got your job. Why is that? Come join us. So these people, like I said, who were never racist,
*  they began thinking, well, you know, they're right. My job is still there. And I worked that job for
*  25 years. And I got laid off for no reason. And somebody else is doing my job. So what do I have
*  to lose? Give me an application. And they sign up. So they're like, you know, coerced into this group.
*  They may be a little easier to come out, you know, talking with them. Then a third reason why people
*  would join, if somebody relocates to a town that is very Klan oriented, a lot of people who
*  currently live there and stuff, you know, if you want to do business in that town, you've got to
*  assimilate. You know, you join the local country club, the local chamber of commerce, and the local
*  KKK. So, you know, those different reasons why people will join. And depending again, you know,
*  depending upon how strong the ties are, why they join can determine the longevity or their hold on
*  it. What is the one that took you the longest to crack? Well, I'll be honest with you. I never set
*  out to convert anybody. And even though in the media, it will say a black musician converts 200
*  Klansmen or X amount of Klan members, I didn't convert anybody. I didn't even convert one of them.
*  I will say that I am the impetus for over 200 leaving the Klan. Yeah, I know that for a fact.
*  And people have told me, yeah, you know, I'm out of because of you and things like that.
*  But I did not convert them. They converted themselves. I gave them reason to think about
*  their direction in life. And they thought about it and thought, you know,
*  I need a better path. And this is the way to go. Because what would happen would be this.
*  It's like, you know, when you believe in something,
*  some people just believe in it just because it's that person saying it.
*  Like, you know, we have a current president where no matter what he says,
*  some people are going to believe and others are going to disbelieve. All right. And that can go
*  for any president, really, if you're a big fan, no matter what you do, what you say,
*  you have a base that's going to believe you. So I would tell these people when I saw fault
*  with what they were saying in their ideology, I said, Well, let me tell you why. I think this
*  is incorrect. And I'd lay out the facts for them. And then they now they may not concede right then
*  and there. But when they go home, they check it out. And it rolls around in their head. And they
*  began thinking, you know, Darrell does have a point. But he's black. But he's black. But he does
*  have a point. But he's black. So even though they know it's true, they don't want to believe it
*  because I'm black. So it's like that cognitive dissonance thing going on. So they have an internal
*  struggle. And they have to make up their own mind. Do I continue living a lie?
*  Or do I turn my life around and live the truth? Well, it's also you're a very articulate guy.
*  And I'm sure a lot of these people are not very educated. So the continued exposure to you is
*  probably confusing to them as well. Because you're so good at forming sentences and speaking and calm
*  and you know, the words flow so smoothly out of your mouth. And you have these wonderful
*  this wonderful grasp of the English language. They're probably like, fuck,
*  I think this guy might be smarter than me. But that had to help.
*  But let me say something, though. Don't be fooled. You know, we think of of clan people,
*  and I say we are people in general, because most of our exposure to it is at the Jerry Springer
*  Show or Geralda where they throw chairs. Yeah, third grade dropout kind of thing.
*  Characters.
*  Yeah. And those are the types that they would bring on the show for whatever reason.
*  And I know plenty of those types, trust me, those stereotypes do exist. But they can go anywhere
*  from third grade dropout, all the way to President of the United States. President Warren G. Harding
*  was sworn into the Ku Klux Klan in the green room of the White House.
*  Whoa, what year was that?
*  Whatever year he was president.
*  So it was post 65.
*  Oh, well, yeah.
*  1865.
*  Yeah, he was in the 1920s, right? With the T Dome, whatever it was.
*  President Harry Truman. Before Harry Truman became president, he was a member of the clan
*  for a short time. That's right. Harry Truman, who integrated the army.
*  Wow.
*  He joined for a short time. He didn't like it. He got out.
*  Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black. Hugo Black was in the Klan at the time he was appointed
*  to the Supreme Court. He had to leave the Ku Klux Klan to sit on the Supreme Court as a justice.
*  More recently, Senator Robert Byrd from West Virginia, who just died a few years ago,
*  he was a Klansman in the 1940s. He was a grand Klegel. Klegel means recruiter. Grand means
*  state. So he was a recruiter for the state of West Virginia, a grand Klegel.
*  In the 1940s.
*  And then he later renounced it and stuff. Yeah. So, you know, all kinds of educational backgrounds.
*  Particularly a long time ago.
*  Um, yeah. Yeah. I mean, it was considered the, uh, an honorable white man society. At the time,
*  you know, they didn't allow women in the Klan and they had women's auxiliaries. Now they allow women,
*  but women, there's still a male chauvinistic organization.
*  So women are making progress, even in the Klan.
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. But, but, but, um, they, they cannot hold the highest offices. They can't be a
*  grand dragon or dragoness.
*  When did you start all this? What year was it?
*  You know, I started, uh, uh, you know, meeting them and all that or researching them.
*  Just when, when, when did you start meeting them? When did you, when did you have this meeting?
*  Actually, the first, the first friendly meeting that I had with, with the Klan was, um, in the
*  bar. That was 1983. But, um, so my first encounter with the Klansman was at the year before, and I
*  didn't know he was a Klansman. I beat him up. Oh, so this, but the bar thing was in 83.
*  I was wondering if it was pre or post the Dave Chappelle bit.
*  Pre, pre. Yeah. That's why.
*  And what's funny is, you know, everybody asks me, you know, did you see that, you know,
*  Clayton Bigsby or whatever it's called? Um, you know, they think it's hilarious,
*  but I'm going to tell you something. It's not hilarious. Okay. Dave Chappelle,
*  he's a comic genius. He's great. Okay. And perhaps if I had never done what I've done,
*  I'd find a lot of humor in it. Um, but I tell you what, he's never been to a Klan rally. I have,
*  I've been to plenty of them. Those things are not funny. They are not funny. Okay. They are a
*  pressure cooker waiting to go off. And if that valve is not really, you know, released, it's
*  going to explode. And we saw that in Charlottesville. Well, you know that he, his joke was in how
*  ridiculous it was. Yeah, absolutely. No, no, no, no. I'm not faulting him.
*  Yeah, I'm not faulting him. Right. Exactly. I understand what you're saying. From your
*  perspective, it's not funny. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, yeah, I mean, there's humor in everything,
*  but, uh, but, you know, we shouldn't take, take racism, you know, um, we need to take it more
*  seriously than we do. And I'm going to tell you something, our country, I'm going to tell you
*  where it's headed so you understand. Um, our country can only become one of two things.
*  It can become number one, that which we stand up, I'm sorry, that which we sit back and let it become,
*  or number two, that which we stand up and make it become. So we are charged with this question.
*  Do I want to, uh, sit back and see what my country becomes, or do I want to stand up and make my
*  country become what I want to see? And I've chosen, I've chosen the latter because I don't
*  like the direction it's going in. Well, you've chosen a very noble, not just the latter, but a
*  very noble path. I mean, what you've done is pretty incredible in the amount of time and energy that's
*  required for you to get close to these guys. And the fact that you could be doing a lot of other
*  things, you're a successful musician. Yeah. I'm sure you have friends. I'm sure you're busy,
*  but you chose to spend an extraordinary amount of time pursuing this. I would much rather be on stage
*  playing music and making people happy and causing them to jump up and dance and carry on and sing
*  along than attending clan rallies. But I find it more and more necessary because we have dropped
*  the ball. You know, the topic that you and I are discussing right now, you know, 20, 30 years ago,
*  would have been taboo talking about on radio or whatever. People did not want to discuss it.
*  And I know we can't talk about that, just keep it in the closet, you know, because out of sight,
*  out of mind, denial. And denying it does not make it go away, just because you can't see it.
*  It's always there. So now we're forced to address it. But let me tell you where it's going,
*  which is what a lot of people do not talk about and don't understand. Well, first of all,
*  let's define what it is. Back in the day, there was only one group, the Ku Klux Klan. They were
*  the first and the largest gang, if you will, of racists. At one point in time, they had four
*  million members. All right. It's a pretty big gang. What was that? Back in the 1920s
*  and into the early 30s. How many people were even in America in the 1920s? More than that.
*  Yeah, but I mean, how many? It wasn't even a hundred million. I don't even know.
*  I bet it's probably about 80, 90 million. Oh, we can look it up for sure. Yeah,
*  because if there's four million, that's an extraordinary number. And the majority of them
*  were in Indiana. Indiana. Indiana, yeah. About 110. 110 million. Wow. And how many? Four million.
*  That's fucking crazy. Yeah, yeah. So it's basically somewhere in the neighborhood of four percent
*  of the entire population of the country who's in the fucking Klan. Yeah. Now, at that time,
*  it was called white supremacy because that's what they believe in. This is our country. We're in
*  charge. We're supreme. They didn't call it the Klan? Yeah, yeah. It was a Klan, but the ideology
*  was called white supremacy. And a lot of, it started in 1865. A lot of violence, a lot of
*  lynchings, bombings, dragging people behind vehicles, all that kind of stuff began happening.
*  And there came a lot of baggage with the term white supremacy, where a lot of white people
*  did not like black people or did not like Jewish people. They did not want to participate
*  in this night writing, lynchings and murder and all that kind of stuff, either for moral reasons
*  or legal reasons, whatever. The membership began dwindling. People began dropping out.
*  All right. It was too violent for them. This white supremacy word became unpalatable and became
*  negative. So when the membership decreased, they had to rebrand. So they changed it from white
*  supremacy to white separatism. I'm a white separatist. I don't hate black people or Jewish
*  people. I just love my own. Blacks and Jews should be able to have their own schools, their own
*  neighborhoods, their own churches, their own workplaces. We should be able to have ours.
*  And that way we don't have to mix. Oh, yeah, yeah. I like that idea. Sign me up. I'm a white
*  separatist. Membership began increasing. And of course, the more people you have,
*  somebody's going to start acting up. So here comes the violence. So now the term white supremacy
*  also became unpalatable and people began dropping out. So membership went down again. And then they
*  had to rebrand. Next, they call themselves white nationals or white nationalists. All right. Now,
*  what is a nationalist? A nationalist is someone who loves their country, like a patriot. So you're a
*  nationalist. I'm a nationalist. Why do we have to say white nationalist? Why can't we just say I'm
*  a nationalist, right? But no, white nationalist. So yeah, I love my country and I'm white. Sign me up.
*  Here comes the violence. So once again, they rebranded it and now they call it the alt-right.
*  And I hate to use a cliché, but as they say, a rose by any other name is what? Still a rose.
*  So you can call it whatever you want to call it. It's still white supremacy.
*  Pete Slauson Do you think that Charlotte was a wake-up call?
*  Charlie Seif Charlottesville.
*  Pete Slauson Charlottesville, excuse me.
*  Charlie Seif Yes.
*  Pete Slauson It was for me because I knew that it still existed, but I didn't think they would
*  show themselves publicly like that in the age of the internet and walk down the street with tiki
*  torches. Charlie Seif Let me tell you something.
*  Charlie Seif Let me – I'm going to show you something.
*  Charlie Seif Okay.
*  Charlie Seif Okay. The rally there was called Unite the Right Rally. I know the guy who put it on.
*  I know all the speakers there. I know them personally. All right? What was your understanding
*  as to why they were having this big Unite the Right Rally?
*  Charlie Seif I only knew of it peripherally. I didn't know why they were doing it. I just had
*  probably heard it on the news or something like that that was going on. And then when I saw the
*  KKK showing – were those guys, the Charlottesville guys with the torches, were those KKK or was it
*  another white supremacy movement? Charlie Seif All of the above. They had different – it was
*  Unite the Right. All the different right wing groups came. League of the South, the Ku Klux Klan,
*  National Socialist Movement, different entities.
*  Pete Slauson Socialist Movement.
*  Charlie Seif Yeah. The National Socialist Movement.
*  Pete Slauson Like the Nazis.
*  Charlie Seif Exactly.
*  Pete Slauson Really?
*  Charlie Seif Yeah. Okay, they were there too. Now,
*  in the media, they gave a reason as to why were they there? What were they protesting? What was
*  their reason for being there in Charlottesville? Charlie Seif I have no idea.
*  Pete Slauson Okay. What the media put out was they had come together to protest the removal
*  of the Confederate statues. Charlie Seif Okay.
*  Pete Slauson You call that?
*  Charlie Seif Yeah, I remember they were tearing down the statues.
*  Pete Slauson Right.
*  Charlie Seif I had a conversation with somebody about it that those statues, most of them were
*  very cheaply made and they were actually put up during the Civil Rights Movement.
*  Pete Slauson Right, exactly.
*  Charlie Seif In response, yes.
*  Charlie Seif Okay. So, that was not the reason why they had the rally. Okay. That's what the media said.
*  Okay. Any time – okay, the reason why they had this rally there, yes, there were some people who
*  went there to legitimately oppose the removal of those statues, Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson,
*  whoever else. But the majority of people who came there were there to start the initial steps of the
*  race war. That's right, the race war. Okay. The white supremacists have been predicting and have
*  been preparing for a race war. Just like Dillon Roof was trying to start the race war, that's what
*  he said when he went to that black church and gunned up the place. The guy who shot all those people
*  in El Paso, he said the race war. All right. Here, anytime you want to occupy a piece of public property
*  because you want to have a rally, a demonstration, or even if you want to set up a lemonade and hot
*  dog stand, if it's going to be on public property, you must have a permit, right?
*  You go down to the city, you get an application, fill out your name, and state your purpose.
*  You cannot very well say on the application, I want to start a race war. You will not get the
*  permit. All right. So you provide some quasi-legitimate excuse. My great, great, great
*  ancestors fought in the Confederacy. That's my heritage. I don't want you messing with it.
*  Okay. That's legitimate. Sign off. Here's your permit, sir. And now you can occupy that
*  corner of 12th and Main from 12 noon to 4 p.m. or whatever. Okay. So they went through all the
*  procedure. They legally got a permit to have their unite the right rally under false pretense.
*  All right. Now, two things. Anybody who knows American history knows that they were also blacks
*  and also Jews who fought in the Confederacy. All right. Black slaves had to fight for their
*  slave owners. In the South, there were a number of Jewish slave owners. They didn't want to give up
*  that free labor. So blacks, Jews, and whites fought together in the Confederacy against blacks,
*  whites, and Jews in the union. My great, great, great ancestors were slaves who also fought in
*  the Confederacy. I have ancestors who fought in the Confederacy. All right. My parents are from
*  Virginia, Roanoke, and Salem. I was born in Chicago because that's where my dad was working
*  at the time. But Virginia was the seat of the Confederacy. All right. So
*  there are black people today and some Jewish people who honor the Confederacy. They don't condone
*  slavery, but they honor the Confederacy because of their great, great ancestors.
*  They honor it how so? Like they have Confederate flags?
*  Yeah. Yeah, they have Confederate flags.
*  Where is this taking place?
*  Mostly in the South.
*  So there's black people in the South that have Confederate flags.
*  Yeah. Absolutely. Look them up. You'll find them.
*  Wow.
*  You'll find them. Yeah. And no, they don't condone slavery. They're just honoring
*  the Confederacy because their ancestors were in it and died in it or whatever. I honor my ancestors.
*  However, I don't honor the Confederacy, me personally. If some of the blacks and Jews
*  want to do that, that's their business. I don't do it. So, and ironically, ironically,
*  this is a historical fact, the Confederate army was integrated. The union army was segregated.
*  All right? Which doesn't make any sense. Okay? So here, you know, we're fighting to free slaves
*  and the Confederate army has blacks and Jews and whites fighting together and the union had them
*  all segregated.
*  It doesn't make sense, but it does because it's all so ridiculous because that's what humans are.
*  Exactly. Exactly. You got it. Irrationality. So, okay, so now, if blacks and Jews want to do that,
*  if blacks and Jews and whites could fight together 150 years ago,
*  why can't they march together in 2017? Wouldn't it make more sense and give more credibility
*  to your cause? If your cause was truly to preserve those statues, why not invite descendants like
*  yourselves of blacks and Jews to march with you in Charlottesville and say, hey, that's my heritage
*  too. Leave it alone. Would that not add more credibility?
*  That certainly would, but what are the numbers? I mean, how many can you get?
*  Even if you only got five or 10.
*  Right.
*  Okay? That still would lend some credibility.
*  Okay.
*  Okay? But instead, so they're claiming this is their heritage. Instead of inviting
*  or including blacks and Jews, they excluded them in 2017.
*  So if blacks and Jews wanted to march, they would not let them?
*  Yeah, exactly. I mean, I don't know that there were any who did.
*  Or they just implicitly stated that this is for white people.
*  No. This is Unite the Right, okay? Yeah, white supremacist organizations. So instead of including
*  blacks and Jews, heritage shouldn't include everybody in that heritage. You talk about the
*  want to preserve the Confederacy? Well, guess what? There were blacks in the Confederacy.
*  You know that. That's a historical fact. There were Jews in the Confederacy.
*  The Confederacy was simply a reflection of the South, okay? So instead of including them,
*  they excluded them and they marched through the University of Virginia campus with their
*  tiki torches and the streets of Charlottesville, yelling and screaming anti-Semitic and racial
*  epithets. What does that tell you? It tells you their protest was not about heritage.
*  It was about hate. That's number one. Number two, nobody in Charlottesville or anywhere else
*  ever met their great, great, great ancestors who fought in the Confederacy, right? Those people
*  were long dead and gone by 1865. And if you weren't even born then, right? Now, you tell me,
*  but it's okay. You know, you can honor people that you don't know. All right, that's fine.
*  But how do you honor your great, great, great ancestors in the Confederacy? And at the same
*  time, you dishonor the very ancestors who you do know, the very ones who raised you,
*  your fathers, your grandfathers. And if you're lucky enough, you may have met your great
*  grandfather. These people, many fathers of these people in Charlottesville, many fathers,
*  grandfathers, and great grandfathers lost their lives fighting, not in the Confederacy,
*  but fighting in World War II. And who were they fighting in World War II? The Nazis. So how do
*  you tell me you're going to honor your great, great, great ancestors and you're going to walk
*  down the streets of Charlottesville side by side with people wearing swastikas? We went to war
*  against the Nazis. Why are you marching with Nazis and flying swastikas? Now, wait, so,
*  what did the Nazis have to do with our heritage? The Nazis had no heritage in Charlottesville,
*  Virginia. In fact, the Nazis weren't even in existence during our Civil War. Adolf Hitler
*  was not even born during our Civil War. So what were the Nazis doing in Charlottesville?
*  It wasn't about heritage. It was about hate. And that's what the media failed to tell us,
*  because what the media did was they went to City Hall, because it's a public record,
*  just pulled the permit and read, oh, they're there to protest the statues. They took it verbatim,
*  and they reported like that. They didn't do the background check. Now, was it a small percentage
*  of them that were the ones that were marching with the torches and the swastikas? No. And then they
*  joined into the entire group, or was the entire group all about hate? So everybody was there.
*  I would say probably about 95% of people there were about hate.
*  And so there was a few misguided people that were there because they really thought they were
*  protecting their Southern heritage, and they were lumped in with all these other people that used
*  it as a ruse to sort of set up this hate meeting. To have a permit.
*  How many people went there for that thing?
*  I mean, there were more protesters, as usual, which there should be. I don't have the exact
*  numbers myself. I'm trying to get them. They get skewed from either side. The police would tell
*  you one number, and the people there would tell you another number. The guy who was the killer
*  that ran those people over. James Fields. That guy seemed to be the epitome of a lost soul.
*  That got sucked into a horrible ideology. It was not very smart. And that must be a large
*  percentage of what they prey on. Absolutely.
*  Lost people. Isn't that how a cult works?
*  Sure. And they give you a meaning and a reason and a heritage to defend.
*  And a status. And a status, right? And then a bunch of crazy names like Cyclops and Nighthawk.
*  And I know Susan Brough. Susan Brough is the mother of Heather Heyer, the girl who was murdered
*  and run down by James Fields. That 20-year-old boy threw his life away. And it was premeditated.
*  He had said stuff on the internet before even going there. And praised Hitler and so forth
*  and so on. These are things that we have to be very much aware of. And which is why today
*  you know I'm helping an organization as an advisor. In fact we're putting on a festival
*  of ideas this year in June. We've already got Cornell West and Tim Poole, Bill Oppman,
*  and several other people who have already committed to doing this festival of ideas to
*  de-radicalize the internet. And there's a new internet platform that's been around just for
*  over almost two years. It's already gotten two million members called Minds. Minds,
*  like your mind. Yeah, I've had the guy who created it. Yeah, Bill Oppman. Yeah. Fantastic guy.
*  Fantastic guy. He and another co-founder put together this thing and they brought me on as
*  an advisor. And we're gonna put on this festival. Bringing in some formers. Now the head of the
*  NSM is a very good friend of mine. And what is the NSM? A National Socialist Movement. The Nazi
*  Party. You're going to slowly convert those guys as well? Well yeah. He's out now. Oh, he left?
*  Yeah. Because of you? No, I was a contributor. Okay. But he saw the light. And he's a good guy.
*  And he's helping to get others out. You have an amazing ability to forgive people that other
*  folks would write off for life. Other people would think that those people were horrific monsters
*  that aren't worthy of salvation. Don't get me wrong. There are some of those people. There are
*  some horrific monsters on all sides. Some of whom will go to their grave being hateful, violent,
*  and racist or anti-Semitic. There is no changing them whatsoever. But I can tell you this. If
*  somebody of that attitude or that belief, you know, they're there and you're here on the spectrum at
*  opposite ends, if they're willing to sit down and have a conversation, no matter how extreme they
*  may be, there is the opportunity to plant a seed. But the important thing is anybody can plant a
*  seed. But the follow-up is what's important. You have to nurture that seed. You must water it.
*  So it grows. When you're here, you think you have nothing in common. But if you spend five minutes
*  with your worst enemy, you will find something in common. You will find something in common.
*  And then you begin nurturing those commonalities. And you're closing that gap. So now you're about
*  right here. So now you have formed a relationship. You've gone from here to a relationship.
*  And now you begin nurturing that relationship. And you're closing it in. And when you get about
*  to here, you found a lot of commonalities. And now you've made a friendship. All right?
*  And when you get there, the trivial things that you have in contrast, such as the color of your
*  skin or whether you go to a church, a temple, a mosque, or a synagogue, begin to matter less and
*  less. You'll begin to see that. And I'll be honest, the most important thing that you have
*  in any endeavor is your credibility. You only have one opportunity to make, especially in this kind
*  of thing, to make a good first impression. You may have a second or third opportunity to
*  impress somebody, but you only have one opportunity to make a good first impression.
*  And most people would judge you by their first impression of you. So when I would meet these
*  people, I'm as transparent as I can be. I'm honest. I don't lie to them. I let them know where I stand,
*  but I'm willing to listen to them. I want to hear why. I'm saying, enlighten me. Teach me why
*  I should believe the way you believe and see things. I'm here to learn from you.
*  Nat. Now, how did you start the conversation with this National Socialist Movement guy?
*  John. The same way.
*  Nat. Same way.
*  John. The exact same way.
*  Nat. And what was the conversation like with him?
*  John. Well, he believes, or he believed at the time, in the ideology of Adolf Hitler,
*  the master race.
*  Nat. How old was this guy when you met him?
*  John. I met him in 2016. He just left last year, and he'd been the commander for 27 years.
*  Nat. You have an amazing gift. The ability to just slowly talk to these people and talk some
*  sense into them, and the fact that you're willing to spend the time to do that, that is-
*  John. We have to do that. We have to do that. I mean, what choice do we have?
*  You know, otherwise, we're going to self-destruct. Now, I will say, you know, Joe, I have been
*  between traveling with my parents as a child in the Foreign Service, and today as a professional
*  musician playing all over this country and around the world. When you combine those travels together,
*  I have been in a total of 57 different countries on six continents. So I've been, from, you know,
*  three years old, I'll be 62 in March. I've been exposed all my life to a wide variety of religions,
*  cultures, traditions, ethnicities from all over. And no matter how far I've gone from the United
*  States, no matter how many different people I've met, I can conclude at the end of the day,
*  we all are human beings. We may practice different things, have different cultures,
*  different beliefs, but we all are human beings. And one of my very favorite quotes of all time
*  is by Mark Twain, and it's called the travel quote. And Mark Twain said,
*  travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people
*  need it sorely on these accounts. Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be
*  acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one's lifetime. And that is so true.
*  Perhaps if I had not done that traveling and been exposed to different things, would I be doing this
*  today? Maybe not. But I think the future of this are things like what Bill Altman has put together,
*  this minds.com. And people should check it out, minds.com, or also go to change.minds.com. They
*  can follow me there at Darrell Davis, where it's a platform for free speech, free speech, and
*  where you can come and express your ideas, not be kicked off and all that kind of stuff.
*  You know, there's going to be protocol, you know, where you're not going to be able to threaten
*  people and cause them harm and things like that. But you allow people with some of these toxic
*  ideologies to come on and speak their mind, and then you engage them. And we engage them,
*  and talk. It could be about politics. It could be about technology, whatever.
*  Have you had luck talking to people just directly online? Because my perspective is that
*  one of the things that makes this work is that you're very personable, and that, you know,
*  you're just you being around you. You're a very nice guy to be around. I think that probably
*  helped them get closer to you and get to appreciate you.
*  That's the credibility that I'm talking about. Because, you know, if, like for example,
*  I don't meet somebody one time, and that's, you know, they're stripping themselves of their
*  Robin Hood. Okay, it may take repeat visits and things like that.
*  But it's in person is what I'm saying. Yeah.
*  Like talking to people online, it's very difficult to get through to people.
*  Yeah, it is. But you know what? People have watched or seen things online about me and then
*  have emailed me. I got tons of emails. People in the Klan, people in the Nazi movements or whatever
*  was to say, hey, you know, I appreciate what you said. You know, you gave this person a fair shake.
*  I wasn't really expecting that from a black person or something like that. And it wasn't that I was,
*  you know, kissing up to somebody. No. You know, I'm going to be fair and be transparent.
*  And because of my credibility, that affords me a second visit with them and a third. Because if
*  they didn't like me, if their first impression of me was, this guy's an ass, you know, and I say,
*  hey, you know, can we meet next week? Nah, I'm done with you.
*  The only person that I've ever known or heard of that's been like radically converted just online
*  was Megan Phelps. Do you know who she is? Sure. Sure. I know.
*  I never met Megan. I had conversations with Rachel who was crazy. Is Rachel the mom or
*  one of the sisters? Megan's sister. Yeah. Megan's very, very nice person. It's hard to believe
*  that she was ever locked into the Westboro Baptist Church. And her husband, her now husband,
*  actually converted her by talking to her on Twitter, of all things. Might be the greatest
*  thing that's ever been accomplished on Twitter. That's right. So do you participate in other social
*  media platforms like Facebook or Instagram or any of that? Or do you just use Minds?
*  I'm going to focus on Minds. I think Minds has the best platform. Again, like I said,
*  it's transparent. Anybody is welcome. You said there's two million members now.
*  Yeah. And growing. And Facebook will kick you off for certain things. Minds does not do that.
*  They won't allow you to threaten somebody. Does Minds have the same sort of algorithm
*  that directs things towards you that you're interested in that could facilitate people
*  getting upset? Facebook does that. It turns out that most of what people are interested in is
*  what upsets them. Yeah. No, they don't operate like that. I think it's worth anybody
*  check out. And people get frustrated. I'm getting off Facebook because I hate all this arguing,
*  and so on. And you can come here and talk to some... Listen, people have a hard time getting
*  together for Thanksgiving because of our current political climate, where somebody voted for our
*  current president and some other family member did not vote for that person. Families should be able
*  to talk about that and respect the fact that your brother or sister voted for our president and you
*  didn't. That should be fine. Let's discuss it. What impressed you about him? What didn't impress
*  you? Why didn't you vote for him? And do it with civil discourse. We have lost the art of civil
*  discourse. And Minds is going to restore that. That's what we're working on.
*  I'm glad you said that. That's one thing that I've learned how to do by doing this podcast,
*  learn how to talk to people better, learn how to really listen to people. And when I first
*  started this podcast 10 years ago, I wasn't very good at it. I didn't really have any experience
*  doing it. Mostly what I was doing was me talking. I was doing stand-up comedy, or I was talking to
*  my friends. Social civil discourse, being able to sit down with people and calm each other down,
*  and have genuine compassion for each other, and just listen to each other,
*  is one of the lost arts in human interaction.
*  It's because we see only what the person did in terms of who they voted for, or what they believe
*  and what they did, what group they joined. We don't see what led them to that, because we don't talk
*  to them. We're only interested in the result. Let's go back to Roger Kelly. Black people are
*  criminals. Why are they criminals? Well, how can you say that? Well, because, Darrell, there are
*  more blacks in prison than there are whites. He sees the result. He's not seeing what led up to
*  that. So that's where we lose. Well, it's also very difficult for people to actually have
*  conversations. Most people are committing to text messages and emails and occasionally phone calls.
*  That's how they interact with each other. Then if you go out to a dinner at a restaurant,
*  you'll see people just sitting across from each other staring at their phones.
*  It's one of the worst times for interaction face to face. I've never seen a pie chart on the
*  difference between the way human beings talk, but there is no question that the amount of people per
*  capita that communicate through electronics versus the way just talking person to person over
*  the last 10 years has radically increased. And so has our hostility towards each other in a lot of
*  ways, particularly through those electronic mediums. Hostility through social media is a
*  relatively new thing. Social media hate. I mean, in these mob groups that just go after people,
*  that's 10 years, maybe max, right? 2010-ish. This is a new thing in human history. And this,
*  what you're doing, what you're talking about, just sitting down, it's so old school, talking to people,
*  becoming friends with people, just speaking. You've got these projects. I mean, you set
*  this sort of friendship in motion with these people and you've changed the course of their lives.
*  And that's a...
*  And then they in turn change my else's.
*  What is that, the Wizard Dragon fellow, what's that guy doing these days?
*  He has to work like two or three jobs because unfortunately, you know, when you have that kind
*  of stigma and you work for a company where the public sees you and they were, oh, that's that guy.
*  What did he used to do?
*  A bricklayer, brickmaker. So he works security now. But there are a lot more of them. Some of them,
*  if they don't have a young family, some of them will come out with me
*  and speak out against their former organization.
*  Pete Slauson There's another guy who's very prominent, Christian Picciolini.
*  Yeah, I know him.
*  Do you know him?
*  I do.
*  Pete Slauson Along the same lines? He's doing that too. He's like converting people and helping.
*  To de-radicalize people. He was co-founder of a group called Life After Hate. And there are a lot
*  of those formers who do that, especially if they don't have a young family because oftentimes,
*  they can get ramifications, you know, for speaking out against their organization.
*  Right.
*  Pete Slauson You know, you take an oath to join those organizations.
*  Of course. Yeah.
*  And they'll come after you or come after your family, things like that. So, some fly low
*  under the radar.
*  Pete Slauson So, your book, what is it titled?
*  Pete Slauson The book is called Clandestine, spelled with a K,
*  Clandestine Relationships. And right now, that book is out of print. I'm working on the second
*  edition, second copy, which will have all new stories and plus a lot of the old stuff and updates.
*  Pete Slauson Have you ever done an audio book?
*  Pete Slauson No, but I think I'm going to do it on this one.
*  Pete Slauson You got to do it. You got a great voice, man. It'll be perfect for an audio book.
*  Pete Slauson I have laryngitis right now, but I have a normal voice too.
*  Pete Slauson Well, it comes and goes. I can hear crackle up,
*  but you obviously have a booming voice. That'd be a great audio book.
*  Pete Slauson It'll be gone in a couple days, that laryngitis.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah. I mean, that way, it's always easy to put back in print as well.
*  And there's so many people that are digesting audio books versus books, me included. I mean,
*  I listen to a lot of podcasts, but I mean, I think half the time I'm in my car, I'm listening
*  to audio books.
*  Pete Slauson Where'd you get the idea to do a podcast? What was the impetus?
*  Pete Slauson Probably, no one would ever give me a radio show.
*  Pete Slauson Mm hmm.
*  Pete Slauson I think I had gotten some offers to do radio shows, but it was for like no money,
*  and you know, satellite radio, kind of a deal for no money. And I had a friend, Anthony Kumia,
*  who's on this show, Opie and Anthony, and he did a radio, like an internet thing in his basement,
*  just for fun. He was already on a radio show, but he put up a green screen in his basement,
*  and he's kind of a nut. And he would get drunk and do karaoke holding a machine gun, like crazy
*  shit. But hilarious. And I was like, this guy just set up a studio in his basement. How wild is this?
*  And so, I said, well, let me just do a little web thing. And so, me and my friend Brian,
*  we started doing it with a webcam, just in a laptop, just talking to people online,
*  answering questions. And then, it started carrying on. But, and then, that was 10 years ago,
*  and it just kept growing. And then, it became what it is now, just by just keep doing it. That's all
*  it was. I just kept doing it. And then, it went from thousands to millions to just this weird
*  number of people that are listening to it and watching it now to its, you know.
*  Pete Slauson Because they have a hunger for what you're putting out there.
*  Pete Slauson Well, conversation.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah.
*  Real conversation. Like, I don't have an agenda. I just want to talk to people. Like, with you,
*  as soon as I got the pitch, I was like, I need to talk to you. Like, what you're doing is insane
*  and amazing and very, very unusual for someone to have that kind of patience and commitment to
*  something like that and to convert these people and without judgment and to be able to rationalize
*  with them and talk to them reasonably. Pete Slauson
*  These are my fellow Americans. You know, we all are in this game together.
*  Pete Slauson And sometimes people get trapped in a really
*  fucking stupid ideology and they don't, there's a part of their brain that knows it's dumb.
*  There's a part of their brain that knows it's toxic and they deny that. They ignore that,
*  they squash it and they try to avoid thinking about it and then someone like you comes into
*  their life and you kind of like open this door. Pete Slauson
*  And Joe, you know, that toxic thing happens on both sides. You know, I catch hell from people
*  who look like me, not everybody, you know, but there are people who look like me who
*  totally disapprove. Joe Buehler
*  Because you're giving these people a platform because you're communicating with them.
*  Pete Slauson Yes. Listen, you cannot change somebody's mind
*  by disallowing them to express what's on their mind.
*  Joe Buehler Right.
*  Pete Slauson You know?
*  Joe Buehler Well, that's the argument about de-platforming
*  people online. Right? But then the argument, the other way is that you're radicalizing young people.
*  The argument is there's a lot of young people that would go on these social media sites
*  and they're impressionable and they don't know any better. Particularly YouTube, they worry about
*  that because these YouTube videos, they have music and it's a multimedia experience.
*  Pete Slauson Right, draws them in.
*  Joe Buehler It can be compelling and with a really good
*  narrator. You can get people to look at this fucking flat earth movement. Right? Where's
*  that coming from? It comes from a few articulate narrators who put together these videos on YouTube
*  where they're the only ones who get to talk. Scientists don't get to interject and go,
*  stop, that's wrong. That's not how, I'll show you. Nope, it's like this. Look, here's a satellite
*  photo. Look, here's a hundred satellite photos. Look, here's all the satellites take pictures of
*  the earth. They don't get to do that. So, these guys, they'll have this long, uninterrupted,
*  narrated video that makes so much sense. You listen to this guy, god, he's genius. Oh my god,
*  the world's flat. I can't believe they're fucking lying to me. So, there's hundreds of thousands of
*  people that believe in the flat earth now because they've been radicalized, because they've been
*  converted by these multimedia things like YouTube. This is what people worried about in terms of
*  radicalizing them towards hateful ideologies as well.
*  Pete Slauson And I'm glad you're using that word radicalized.
*  Joe Buehler Yeah.
*  Pete Slauson Because that's exactly what you're spot on.
*  Because, you know, we, it wasn't until recently that we began using that word domestically.
*  You know, for a while, they were only using it for Middle Eastern type people. You know,
*  when somebody like Dylann Roof did what he did, we didn't say he was radicalized. He must have some
*  mental issues. Joe Buehler
*  Well, it's both, isn't it? Pete Slauson
*  Well, sure. I mean, anybody who walks into a place and starts shooting up people has mental issues.
*  Joe Buehler Yes.
*  Pete Slauson But what allowed them to become radicalized,
*  maybe those mental issues, you know? But we don't say radicalized when it comes to our own.
*  Joe Buehler Yes.
*  Pete Slauson Because we're ashamed of it. So many different code
*  words. For example, what do you call these groups of white people who go out in the woods and
*  practice maneuvers and survivalist stuff? They're like anti-government, kind of a paramilitary.
*  Joe Buehler Yeah, like, what do they call them?
*  Militias.
*  Pete Slauson Exactly.
*  Joe Buehler Right.
*  Pete Slauson Okay, militias.
*  Joe Buehler Right.
*  Pete Slauson What do you call the same type of things with black people?
*  Joe Buehler I didn't know they had them.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, they have them.
*  Joe Buehler What do they call them?
*  Pete Slauson They call them militants.
*  Joe Buehler Oh.
*  Pete Slauson Like the Black Panthers.
*  Joe Buehler Okay.
*  Pete Slauson Okay.
*  Joe Buehler Right, right, right.
*  So, you know, it's the exact same thing.
*  Pete Slauson Right.
*  Joe Buehler But one term has more of a negative connotation.
*  Pete Slauson Militias got a pretty negative connotation.
*  Joe Buehler Not as negative as militant.
*  Pete Slauson Yeah, I guess. Not with me. It seems the same shit to me.
*  Joe Buehler And let's take back when Obama got into office,
*  we had a new political party that came out of nowhere.
*  Pete Slauson The Tea Party.
*  Joe Buehler The Tea Party. Last time you heard of a tea party was in 1776.
*  Pete Slauson What happened to them, those Tea Party folks?
*  Joe Buehler They're still floating around.
*  Pete Slauson Really? They still call themselves a Tea Party?
*  Joe Buehler No, because Obama's gone now.
*  Pete Slauson I think they were out by the time he was,
*  I mean, it was before he was even gone. Didn't they fall apart?
*  Joe Buehler Well, because he got a second term, it didn't quite work.
*  But their slogan was, take our country back. We're going to take our country back. Okay,
*  take America back. That is a Klan slogan. Okay? And it was a code term for the Tea Party
*  that was a clarion call and people, it resonated with a certain ilk of people.
*  That slogan started in 1954 with the Klan. 1954 when Brown versus the Board of Education
*  desegregated schools. You can go on YouTube and find all these Klan rallies with these wizards
*  and drunks saying, with the burning cross in the background saying, we're going to take our country
*  back. I'm not going to let my little white boys and girls go to school with little nigger children
*  and blah, blah, blah. We're going to take our country back, back to segregation. They didn't
*  want to integrate it, right? So, I would ask these Tea Party people, why are you using a Klan slogan?
*  And they say, oh, no, no, no, Darrell, that's not what we mean. I said, well, you don't say,
*  take our country back from who? You don't say, take our country back to what? You say, take our
*  country back, kind of open-ended. I said, what are you trying to say? Oh, what we mean is,
*  we're going to take our country back from the Democrats, take it back to Republican rule.
*  Okay, that's fine. Why not say that? Exactly. Right. They're using an already used slogan
*  that was a KKK slogan. Exactly. So, it hearkens to those people, right? And here's the thing.
*  Last time I checked, Bill Clinton was a Democrat, Jimmy Carter was a Democrat. Where was the Tea
*  Party? Where was take our country back? And then all of a sudden, a black guy gets in the White
*  House and they start screaming, take our country back. Right, right. You can put two and two
*  together, right? Yeah. Where were you guys eight years ago? Exactly. Or four years ago. Yeah,
*  exactly. And now check out Martin Luther King. All right? We had to fight, fight for decades
*  to have Martin Luther King Day. There was a lot of resistance to that. Do you realize that,
*  and a lot of the resistance was the fact that Martin Luther King is the only American man
*  in this country to have a holiday all to himself. And guess what? He's black. What do you mean by a
*  holiday all to himself? What about Columbus Day? Columbus is not an American. Oh, that's right.
*  Okay. Well, he kind of was when he became one. No, he thought he did. Well, he did. First of all,
*  Columbus didn't even land here and he was like basically a serial killer. He was a serial killer.
*  He was a rapist and a pillager and he didn't, he didn't discover a damn thing. What did they call
*  an indigenous people's day now? Yeah. Now, how do you discover something when you get there,
*  people are already there? Come on, be real. Well, not only that, like why did it take until
*  basically the latter half of the 20th century before people came to grips with the fact that
*  he was an atrocious human being? Like when we were kids, when I was in, I'm a little bit younger
*  than you, I'm 52, when I was in high school, it was Columbus. Just sailed the ocean blue,
*  the Pinto, the Santa Maria. Right, Nino Pinto and Santa Maria. This was a guy who was an explorer.
*  He was going there for Spain. And then when you get older and you read these missionaries,
*  it counts of the horrific crimes. And we still celebrate them. Yeah. Well, I mean,
*  do we sort us out? We kind of are done celebrating them, right? No, we still have Columbus Day.
*  It should be abolished. I thought it's indigenous people's day now. They call it that. But on the
*  counter it still says Columbus Day. Does it? Yeah. Not on the Apple calendar. Really? That's
*  cool. I don't think so. Maybe Apple's ahead of its time. I think it says indigenous people's day now.
*  Okay, that's cool. Maybe I'm wrong. But it fucking should. It should. Yeah. Now,
*  so we used to have two white guys who each had a holiday all to himself, Americans. Who are those
*  guys? We used to have, maybe before your time, during my time, George Washington Day and Abraham
*  Lincoln Day. Really? What were those days? You don't remember that? I don't remember that. Yeah.
*  And so we had too many holidays. So they combined those two days into one day called President's Day.
*  Okay, we had too many holidays. We didn't have enough productivity. Exactly. So yeah,
*  so they took those away and combined them. So now the only American man who has a holiday to himself
*  is a black man, and they can't handle it. Martin Luther King. And now we had to fight for decades
*  to give this man a holiday when he gave his life to bring this country together.
*  Yet we give a holiday to Christopher Columbus, who, as you pointed out, was a murderer, a serial
*  killer, a pillager, a rapist. Okay, who didn't discover a damn thing? Right? Martin Luther King
*  never murdered, pillaged, and raped, but yet we didn't want to give him a holiday. So that's the
*  inequity in this country. And I'll tell you something else. Now, there are a lot of people
*  who would disagree with me, and that's okay, because we're Americans, we can disagree.
*  We're all individuals, but there are people who will agree with me also. And I've been saying
*  this now for 22 years. One of the things that will help us to advance into the 21st century,
*  because we are behind the times, we need at this point to get rid of Black History Month.
*  Now, I know a lot of people listening are going to freak out, what's this guy talking about?
*  Let me explain. All right? For the longest time, we needed Black History Month.
*  Black History was not being taught in our schools. Now, you remember when you pointed out a moment
*  ago that when you were in school, you know, Columbus was a hero, looked up to him, etc.,
*  and then you go to college, you learn otherwise. When I was in high school, it was not in our
*  textbooks that we had internment camps for Japanese Americans. I did not learn that until
*  I got to college. I'm like, what? Are you kidding me? I didn't believe it. Now it's in the textbooks.
*  That's what I'm saying. We're behind the times. Okay. So anyway, we didn't have Black History,
*  right? What we had was called American History. It might as well have been called White History,
*  because that's all it was. And even in some cases, whites were being given credit
*  for things they did not invent and for places they did not discover. But we knew, we were told at home,
*  things like that, but not in schools. So we had to fight, fight, fight. And finally, we got one week.
*  It was called Negro History Week. Carter G. Woodson created that, and schools had Negro History
*  Week one week a year. We continued fighting harder and harder. Finally, we got one month.
*  Nobody's going to give us everything at one time, right? They had doled it out little by little.
*  So we got that one month, shortest month of the year, right? February 28 days. No coincidence.
*  But we accepted it for two reasons. It was the birth month of two of our heroes, Frederick Douglas
*  and Abraham Lincoln. So we accepted that. And then we stopped fighting. And that was a mistake on our
*  part. We became complacent. And now it's my belief that Black History Month has become detrimental
*  to us, to all of us, white and black. I'll tell you why. Yes, we needed it for a certain period
*  of time because we had nothing. But here's the problem. We only study black history in February.
*  And each February, we study the same half a dozen people. Martin Luther King, Rosa Parks,
*  Harriet Tubman, Booker T. Washington, George Washington Carver, and one or two other ones.
*  By the time we get through half a dozen, up, our month is over. We did our black thing. Let's move
*  on, right? Yet we study Benjamin Franklin, Eli Whitney, Alexander Graham Bell, Thomas Edison,
*  F. Scott Fitzgerald, Francis Scott Key, all year long. We're constantly reinforcing what they did
*  all year long. We never forget who flew the kite and the lightning hit the key, and we have
*  electricity. We all know it's Ben Franklin, all right? But yet, if you ask some kid in June,
*  say, who was Harriet Tubman? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I remember her. Yeah. She was that lady who refused
*  to give a receipt on the bus. They got confused with Rosa Parks because there's been no
*  reinforcement since February. And then next year, next February, it's the same half a dozen people,
*  all right? So you're constantly... I'm not taking anything away from those people. They were some
*  of the greatest, all right? But you're constantly reinforcing that there were only six or seven black
*  people in this whole country who ever did anything. What about the guy who invented the traffic light?
*  What about the person who invented the ironing board and so many other black discoveries and
*  inventions? Oh, well, we didn't have time for that. We only have one month. Yeah, but you got time
*  to talk about Ben Franklin all year long, you know? Women's history month is March. We need to get
*  rid of that too. Take these things out of those months and put them where they belong, under the
*  umbrella of American history, and teach them all year long. That way kids get accustomed to this,
*  and they learn and they have more respect for each other. Look, I remember when I was a kid,
*  Miss America beauty contest. There were only two categories. And it was all white women. Black
*  women were not allowed to join Miss America, to compete in Miss America. All the judges were white
*  males. Two categories, the evening gown, evening wear, and the swimsuit. That was it. Women were
*  objectified. They were sex objects. You know, they didn't have talent. They didn't need to write an
*  essay or show what else they can do. They just looked at and judged on that. So black women were
*  deemed not beautiful enough to compete in Miss America. Plus, they didn't want any white man
*  judging a black woman in a bathing suit or whatever. So black women began having low self-esteem
*  because they were told they were not as beautiful as these other women. So what did we as black
*  people do to elevate the self-esteem of black girls? We created the Miss Black America beauty
*  pageant to give them something to aspire to. And that worked for a while. Finally, finally,
*  Miss America, the big one, came to its senses and opened its doors to all...
*  What year was that?
*  I don't know the exact year, but I guess it was back in the
*  70s sometime. Opened its doors to all American women, regardless of their ethnicity,
*  color, or whatever. As long as they were American, they could compete. And since that time,
*  we've had more than one Miss America who's been black, starting with Vanessa Williams,
*  and then Debbie Turner, I think maybe one or two other ones since that time. So now, because Miss
*  America has come into the time, we can get rid of Miss Black America. We don't need it anymore,
*  right? We got the main one. When are we going to come to American history? We need to get rid
*  of Black History Month. We just finished the first black American president. What are we going to do
*  with Obama? Are we going to put him in the February box because he's black? Only talk about him in
*  February. Don't talk about him in March or September because he's black history. Put him in
*  February. I'm at a loss for words, man. It's crazy how we do this. Listen, we claim to be
*  the greatest nation on the face of this earth. I have a problem with that, and don't get me wrong,
*  I'm a patriot. I love my country, but I do have a problem with that statement.
*  And I'll say that perhaps we are the greatest nation on the face of this earth technologically.
*  After all, we put a man on the moon. We invented the technology to carry that man to the moon
*  safely and allow him to walk around, get back in his lunar module, and come back to earth
*  safely. We invented that technology. Not only that, when Neil Armstrong was up there walking
*  around and made that famous one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind, quote,
*  we were able to talk with him live all the way from earth, NASA headquarters, all the way to the
*  moon, live via satellite radio phone. We invented that technology, Americans. Everybody you know has
*  a cell phone. Everybody you know has email. Hit a few words, hit a few numbers, hit send.
*  You're talking to people next door in Nevada or over in Africa, China, Australia, wherever you want
*  to talk, anywhere on the face of this earth. We invented that technology. So how is it that we,
*  as Americans, can talk to people as far away as the moon or anywhere on the face of this earth,
*  yet so many of us have difficulty talking to the American who lives right next door
*  because he or she is a different color, a different religion, a different ethnicity,
*  a different persuasion, a different whatever. It seems to me that before we can call ourselves
*  the greatest, our ideology needs to catch up to our technology. And when we get ourselves up there,
*  both of them up there, then we can truly brag about how great we are because we are living in
*  the 21st century. We are living in space age times, yet there's still so many of us thinking
*  we're still in age minds. What is this doing in the 21st century? What was it doing in any century?
*  But yet in the 21st century, you gotta be kidding me.
*  Well, it brings me back to what you were saying earlier that the problem is education. The problem
*  is ignorance. And the solution to education is ignorance. And this is sort of the same thing
*  when it comes to radicalizing young people online. One of the reasons why that works at all
*  is because these young people are susceptible to other ideas because their intelligence immune
*  system is very low. They don't have a lot of data. They don't have a lot of education. They don't
*  have a lot of information. And they don't have a lot of perspective. So they can be tricked. They
*  can be roped in. And this is the same with everything. This is the same with what you were
*  talking about with not trusting your neighbors because they're a different nationality or a
*  different color and not communicating with people that are any different than you and then being
*  toxically tribal. It's all kind of the same thing. It's like there's a lack of understanding of what
*  the consequences that are globally and then personally to your own life.
*  1.12
*  Well, again, back to Mines. Mines is going to help those young kids get those perspectives.
*  We'll have people on there who are the experts in sucking those kids into these things. I know a
*  former Jihadi recruiter for ISIS who used to recruit kids to put them in ISIS here in the
*  States. Okay. Get him, Jeff Scoop, the guy from the NSM. He knew what to do in order to lure people
*  into his movement. 2.30
*  What's the NSM? 2.30
*  A National Socialist Movement. The Nazis. Yeah. So these people are willing to help on Mines and help
*  point out these different things, these little telltale signs as to what to look for
*  so parents can spot what, oh, this doesn't sound right, blah, blah, blah. Get my kid off of here
*  and give kids a better perspective. 3.30
*  Does Mines have a video component to it? 4.30
*  It will. It will. Absolutely. Absolutely.
*  3.30
*  I'm thinking about working on that now. See, that is for better, whether it's correct or not,
*  that's apparently the people that are really worried about people being radicalized online,
*  they're more concerned with that than anything else, with video. There's something about
*  the compelling videos. 4.30
*  And you're talking about the music and the video and everything?
*  Yes. Yes. 4.30
*  Oh, yeah. Because kids grab, you know, because they play video games all day. It lures them in.
*  But, you know, back to what I was saying before, and I'm going to finish it. What's happening that
*  we don't see in the media a lot is this. When I was a kid, the black population in this country
*  was 12 percent, 11.9, 12 percent. Native Americans, just under 1 percent. Hispanic people,
*  Latino people, 2 and 3 percent. Asians, 4 percent. White people, 84, 86 percent. So,
*  white people of the supremacist type mindset, their biggest nemesis, of course, were black people
*  at 12 percent. Whoa, that's way too much. You know, they didn't care anything about Native
*  Americans. Their attitude was, that's just 1 percent. Stick them on a reservation, forget about
*  them, right? And that's where these negative terms come from, you know, that a lot of people don't
*  realize are insulting terms, you know, when you say somebody's gone off the reservation.
*  You've heard that term before, right? Yeah.
*  Yeah. I never even thought of that until just now.
*  Exactly. Yeah. Oh, wow.
*  You see what I'm saying? You don't realize it's a negative term.
*  Yeah. Or when somebody says,
*  that's none of your cotton picking business. Ah.
*  Okay. Who picked cotton? Right. Right.
*  Okay. I thought it was a nice way saying motherfucking.
*  You know, like people say freaking. Yeah.
*  It's none of your cotton picking business, but yeah.
*  Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
*  Or when somebody comes from the wrong side of the tracks.
*  Oh, yeah. That one's obvious.
*  Yeah. The railroad track divided blacks on one side, whites on the other.
*  Yeah. The wrong side, of course, was the black side.
*  Anyway, so the biggest nemesis, if they were of that supremacist mindset, were black people.
*  12 percent is too much, right? Now, today, black people, we remain at 12 percent. We've not grown.
*  12.6, if you look at 2017 census, we have not grown 12 percent. Native Americans are still at 1 percent.
*  Um, Asians are at 6 percent. Hispanics have surpassed us. They're like at 13 percent or
*  something, just above 13 percent. So let's just take 12 percent black, 13 percent Hispanic,
*  let alone 6 percent Asian or whatever. That's 25 percent non-white. This is happening. Okay?
*  And it's well predicted by 2042, which is 22 years from now, this country, for the first time
*  in history, will be 50 percent white and 50 percent non-white.
*  Dun dun dun.
*  Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun. Right?
*  So the story you've seen is true. Now, um, that is a very hard pill to swallow for people of that
*  mindset. They're becoming unhinged and disconcerted, you know?
*  And that was the they will not replace us thing, right?
*  Precisely. Exactly. Now you're getting it. Exactly. And that's what they call the browning
*  of America and the white genocide. And see, what they're doing is these groups are stepping up
*  their recruitment efforts now. Because one of the main problems in this country, one of the main
*  concerns is illegal immigration. So these groups are saying, hey, you know, we're against illegal
*  immigration too. Come join us. You know, they're getting on a legitimate bandwagon. But when they
*  say illegal immigration, it's a code word. It's a code word for people from South America,
*  Mexico, West Africa, okay? Because there are plenty of people here in this country right now
*  who are here from Canada.
*  Nobody gives a fuck about Canadians coming in here.
*  Exactly. Canadians or people from the UK or Eastern Europe.
*  And the Canadians speak perfect English too.
*  Sure.
*  They slide right in.
*  And it doesn't even matter if they speak perfect English or not. If you're, you know,
*  these Nazis and Klan people tell me, Darrell, I don't want my grandkids to be brown. Well,
*  you know, if their kid were to marry somebody from Canada, their grandkids are going to be white.
*  Or the UK or Eastern Europe, they're going to be white. But if they let their grandkids
*  marry somebody from El Salvador or Guatemala or Nigeria, oh, heaven forbid, right?
*  Heaven forbid.
*  Oh, it's a trouble. So what happens is this. They say, come join us. You know,
*  we're going to take our country back. We're going to build that wall, blah, blah, blah.
*  So people see the landscape changing, you know? And so they go and join these groups.
*  And the group doesn't do anything. So then what happens? They say, you know what?
*  If the Klan can't do it, if the NSM can't do it, I'll do it myself.
*  And that's when they walk into a synagogue, boom, boom, boom, boom, or into a black church,
*  boom, boom, boom, or El Paso, boom, boom, boom, boom, okay? These are called lone wolves.
*  Now, we have intelligence agencies or whatever that can infiltrate some of these groups and get
*  in there and get all the stuff and foil those plots, you know, gather intelligence. But you
*  cannot infiltrate a lone wolf. It's only one person, right? And as we get closer and closer
*  to 2042, unfortunately, we're going to see more and more of these lone wolves. And that's what
*  we have to watch out for. So you notice every time one of these white supremacist types gets
*  busted and they go and raid his home, what do they find? A whole cache of automatic weapons
*  and all that kind of stuff. That's for the race war.
*  When they track racism over the last 100 years, it's at a decline. It's at a measurable decline,
*  but not enough. What could be done to accelerate that decline? What do you think can be done
*  to sort of start teaching civics, spike up the civics in elementary school? Don't wait to hide
*  school. By civics, what do you mean exactly? You know, our country is so diverse now. We need to
*  learn about the history of everybody in our country and everybody's contributions to making
*  this a great country. White, black, Hispanic, women, whatever. Our country is truly a melting pot.
*  And we need to treat it as such and give everybody credibility. So, you know, this person
*  looks different than me, but he contributed something that I need. I look different than him,
*  but I contribute something that he needs. That kind of thing. So we have more mutual respect
*  for one another. The older generations are going to die out, but we have to stop them from
*  proliferating their BS to these younger generations. And we do this in schools.
*  Look, when I was in junior high school, which they don't have anymore, right? They have middle
*  school now. Sex education was being introduced. Parents were freaking out. Oh my God, I don't want
*  my kid learning that. Well, guess what? They didn't want their kid going to school and learning about
*  sex, but yet these parents were not teaching their kid about sex at home either. They don't want their
*  kid learning it. How are you going to stop a kid from learning about sex? If you don't let your
*  teachers in school educate them properly and you're not willing to do it at home, your kid's still
*  going to learn it. And where is he or she going to learn it? Out in the street. And then what are
*  you going to do when your kid comes home pregnant? You're going to be all freaked out. So if you want
*  to take sex ed, when I was in junior high school, you had to bring a note from your parents saying
*  it was okay. Yeah, yeah. Okay. And then you had like a little small class of five or six people
*  taking sex ed. Today, it's part of the regular curriculum. And as a result, kids today are better
*  informed about venereal disease, STDs, family planning, contraception, and all these kinds of
*  things because they're no longer ignorant. They have more information. All right? The same thing,
*  the taboo on sex education has been lifted. We need to lift the taboo on racism in schools
*  and talk about it at an early age. How much time are they allocating towards teaching people
*  how to accept diverse groups and how to accept, how to fight against racism? I mean, is that
*  something that's taught? It seems like that should be a core curriculum. In private schools,
*  where I see it is mostly in private schools. I don't see it in public schools,
*  which is very unfortunate. You know, parents seem to run the schools. You know, if your kid,
*  for example, you send your kid to school and you find out your kid is not learning what you
*  think he or she should learn, what do you do? You take him out of that school and put him in
*  another school. If they don't learn it there, you put him in a private school. If they don't learn
*  it there, you take him home and you homeschool him. And so, you know, a lot of schools are very loath
*  to step on eggshells with parents. You know, they don't want to upset the parents, whatever,
*  but they need to. The parents are not the teachers. The teachers are the teachers.
*  Pete Well, it seems that if you could explain to kids how people get radicalized,
*  if you could explain to kids what happens online, how they draw you in, what's the appeal of being
*  a part of a tribe, which is a big part of it, right? A big part of it is being like a gang.
*  Pete Right.
*  Pete Same thing that attracts kids to gangs. Like everybody's in it, we're all together. It's like
*  it's in a tight group.
*  Pete Right.
*  Pete Yeah, I mean, that gets people in and when they draw you in, like if the kids said,
*  oh, this is that shit they talked about in seventh grade, I know what they're doing. I mean,
*  just that alone.
*  Pete Then they're better prepared.
*  Pete Yes.
*  Pete That information.
*  Pete Yes.
*  Pete Exactly.
*  Pete Yes.
*  Pete And so, schools are one thing, academic at an early age. The next thing I fault
*  are churches. Well, when I say churches, I mean religious institutions,
*  which would include synagogues, etc. And you know, I hate to get down on the clergy, but I'm
*  telling you, they have accountability that they're not accepting. And don't get me wrong,
*  I'm a Christian, all that kind of stuff, and I was a deacon in my church at one time.
*  But here's the thing, whether you're Jewish, Catholic, Protestant, Mormon, whatever,
*  you have some form of Sunday school. And so, you go down in the basement in your facility,
*  in your church or temple or whatever, and your Sunday school lesson, when you're four or five
*  years old, they teach you that we're all God's children. God made a rainbow, right? And we
*  accept that at four or five years old. And then as we grow older, we reach puberty, adolescence,
*  whatever, we move upstairs to the big congregation. Now we're sitting up there with the adults.
*  The clergy, the rabbi, the priest, the minister, the pastor, the reverend, whatever, no longer
*  teaches that Sunday school lesson. They stop saying upstairs, we're all God's children.
*  What do you think would happen if the reverend or the priest were to say to the congregation one
*  Sunday morning, hey folks, guess what? It's okay for blacks and whites to marry. It's okay for
*  Jews to marry Catholics. Half the congregation would get up and leave, and they wouldn't be
*  putting their money in the collection plate, because they're not hearing what they want to hear,
*  right? Because it has not been continued. That Sunday school lesson needs to be continued
*  upstairs so adults feel, hey, you know, we're all a rainbow, we're all God's children. But the priest
*  does not say that, or the reverend does not say that anymore, because he's afraid of walking on
*  eggshells and stopping the flow of money coming into tithes and offerings in that collection plate.
*  People be changing churches or firing him, right? And then your kid is, let's say I'm Catholic,
*  and now I'm in 12th grade, and I'm going to the senior prom. So my mom says,
*  so, so Darrell, who are you taking to the senior prom? I say, I'm going to take Susan Goldberg.
*  Yeah, you know, Susan's a nice girl, but don't you think you should take a nice Catholic girl?
*  Well, yeah, mom, but I mean, but, you know, I thought we're all God's children. Yeah, we are.
*  But.
*  Exactly. But is not a God word.
*  Right.
*  But is a man word. God was perfect. If we are to believe in the concept of God,
*  then we are to believe that God did not make any exceptions in butts and mistakes,
*  etc., little loopholes. He was perfect from the word go. But is a man word. It's an exception.
*  God was perfection. Man is exception. All right? So that's what happened, you know?
*  If so, so that's why the clergy does not continue that Sunday school lesson.
*  They're afraid of losing money. In other words, they put, they put money above morality
*  and they should be held accountable.
*  Well, it seems like there's a lot of problems. It's not, it's not one thing. It's not just a
*  clergy and it's not just the schools. It's certainly the parents and it's certainly what
*  the parents were taught. So it's the parents' parents. It's the continuing of the ignorance.
*  Right. But the biggest, one of the most, the most influential, unless you're atheist, of course,
*  the most influential authority in your life is your church. Everybody goes to church as a kid,
*  unless you're atheist or whatever. So that weighs very heavily.
*  Well, how do you reach the atheist then? How do you reach the atheists then?
*  You know, like.
*  Or the agnostics.
*  A lot of atheists and agnostics have excellent morals. A lot of them do. They have churches
*  called ethical societies and I've spoken to many of them before. You know, they don't believe in
*  God, which is not something that I advocate, but I'm saying that they know right from wrong.
*  And you find less controversy and racism and more acceptance in these places,
*  because it's about ethics and morality more so than division. Why do you have a white Baptist
*  church and a black Baptist church? What's that all about? A Baptist should be Baptist.
*  It's the same King James Bible, you know? And why aren't they preaching the same lesson
*  in Sunday school that they preach upstairs? They're not concerned about telling little
*  four and five year olds that we're all God's children, God made a rainbow. You know why?
*  Because little four and five year olds don't have any money, so they're not getting any money in the
*  collection plate there. It doesn't matter. It matters where the money is. You say what you've
*  got to say to get the amount of money that you need.
*  You know, I don't go to church, so that's an alien concept to me, but it's sad if that's the lesson,
*  if that's the way they're structuring their lessons in a church or a synagogue or a temple,
*  that that's how they're doing it. They're structuring their lessons to achieve more
*  donations. Look at these mega churches. Yeah, well, look at them.
*  And how many times do some of these priests and preachers get in trouble?
*  Those mega churches always seem to me to be run by cult leaders that are keeping it together.
*  They're just keeping it together, staying within the structure of traditional Christianity.
*  People want to believe in something. So why not believe in the clan? Why not believe in whatever?
*  Yes, yeah, yeah. Yeah, it's tribal. We have this intense desire to stay tribal, but we've got to
*  consider ourselves a tribe of the human race. Exactly. The human race.
*  That can be taught to people. It can.
*  Yeah. I think what you're proving and what you're doing by your amazing accomplishments
*  is showing that even in the most radicalized of people, the KKK and the National Socialist Movement,
*  you're converting people. Well, I'm going to hook you up with some friends of mine, like Jeff
*  Scoop, who was the recent leader of the NSM, Arno Michaelis, who co-founded Life After Hate,
*  and he spends his whole life dedicated to de-radicalizing people.
*  Please do. I'd love to hear their stories. Absolutely.
*  And you can get their perspective. What got them in, but more importantly, what got them out?
*  What were the triggers that got them out after years of hating people and doing this? What made
*  them see something differently? And how can that be parlayed into other entities?
*  Well, I'm hoping that just hearing it from someone who's maybe struggling with that,
*  maybe they live in a very tribal community or they're in some sort of a toxic environment,
*  their family dragged them in, and they're really trying to figure out how long they can do this
*  and how they can get out and what's the steps to get out. Well, it's not only getting out, but
*  there has to be, and here's another thing that I provide for these people when they come out,
*  I provide support because oftentimes these people, if they come from a family that belong to these
*  groups and they decide to leave the group or whatever, they still got their family or whatever.
*  But if they come from a family that was not racist, for example,
*  there may have been some dysfunction or they just read the wrong book or made friends with
*  the wrong person and went down that rabbit hole or whatever, and they give an oath and they join
*  these groups, the family disowns them. You don't want your kid around your house if you have
*  black friends or Jewish friends and he's over there insulting them. You stay away from this
*  house. You're not along with my kid. So their family becomes that group. You took a blood oath,
*  we got your back, you got our back, we are your family.
*  Just like gangs.
*  Just like gangs, okay? And then finally you come to your senses and you see how crazy it was and
*  you quit, you get out. Well, now you're left out there swinging in the wind because your biological
*  family still doesn't want you. You have disgraced them. Your old friends from high school found out
*  you had gone down that road. They don't want to associate with you because you have that
*  stench, that stigma attached to you. You may be an ex-clan member, but that ex-clan member will
*  always precede your title. For example, David Duke, he belongs to all kinds of different white
*  supremacist groups, but whenever you see him listed in the media, so it's ex-clan leader David
*  Duke, blah, blah, blah. It's never just David Duke, that title, ex-clan leader. It follows you.
*  And people look down on you for that. You can't go back to your old group. You've betrayed them.
*  Right.
*  So they want nothing to do with you except to beat you up or something. And so now you're out here,
*  can't go to your family, your friends have disowned you. You turn to alcohol or drugs
*  or some other gang to have that nurture, that belonging.
*  You replace it.
*  Right. So they need something there to support them. And that's also where I come in, where I
*  give them a chance, give them something to believe in, help their self-esteem, et cetera.
*  Dave.
*  And that's very important.
*  Darrell, for anybody who's listening right now, what is the best way for them to find out more?
*  What's the best way for them to take a step? What website would you point them to? Would
*  you point them to your Minds account?
*  Yes, I point them to Minds.com and Change.Minds.com and DarrellDavis.com.
*  Listen, what you've done is amazing. And your message, the way you handle yourself,
*  the way you've managed to infiltrate those groups and just talk sense to them and convert
*  them, it's very inspiring and very humbling.
*  Thank you.
*  I really appreciate you being here, man. I really appreciate you.
*  My pleasure. My pleasure.
*  Spreading your message.
*  Let's consider this part one.
*  Yes, sir. Let's do it again. I would love to.
*  Absolutely. Thank you.
*  I appreciate it.
*  Thank you very much, Darrell.
*  My pleasure.
*  Bye, everybody.
*  Bye.
