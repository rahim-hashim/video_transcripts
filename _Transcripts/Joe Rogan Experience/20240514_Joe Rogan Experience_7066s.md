# Joe Rogan Experience #2150 - Greg Overton
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [May 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teEZZk7I_sE)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day.
*  What's up, bro?
*  Good to see you, my friend.
*  Good to see you.
*  Pull up to the microphone so other people can hear you.
*  So people can hear me and see me.
*  Have you ever done a podcast? Yeah, you have done a podcast. I've listened to you on podcasts.
*  I've done. Oh, you did?
*  Yeah, I listened to you on some podcasts. I was shooting arrows in my backyard and some podcast came up and said Greg Overton.
*  I'm like, get the fuck out of here. My man.
*  See, I'm doing all kinds of shit. Yeah.
*  My boy Justin, who's from Pittsburgh. What's up, Justin?
*  He does the Curious Jones podcast. And we also do those Zippos. He does those.
*  So lit zips. Curious Jones podcast. He's a cool dude.
*  We got one of those right here. Yeah.
*  The Black Dragon, the samurai.
*  Yeah, this is the samurai that we have outside next to the did you see the actual samurai armor?
*  Yeah. Yeah. And the sword.
*  The sword is even older than the armor. The armor is from the 1800s, but the sword is from the 1500s.
*  So is that that's right before the Sengoku Jidai, the time of the country at war, the 300 years where they're at war.
*  I'm trying to think. Did it begin in the 1500s?
*  I don't. Can you look that up?
*  The Sengoku Jidai. Pull that microphone up. Keep it like a fist from your face.
*  There you go. Yeah. All right.
*  So I first found out about you. I don't even remember what year it was, man.
*  I remember I was with my family. I was in Salt Lake and we're walking by this gallery and there was this fucking dope painting.
*  It's huge painting of this Native American guy with a buffalo skull that had a bullet hole in the head.
*  And I was like, God damn. I was trying to figure out where can I put that? Where can I put that fucking thing?
*  And I snoozed. I snoozed and I lose.
*  And then it got bought. But I didn't lose.
*  You know, but that dude is an interesting story.
*  And I'll just tell you, like I had I was shown with this other gallery for a long time that that same painting was like in the back room.
*  And they weren't really giving me my props, which is what people will do if they just want to kind of keep you at a certain level.
*  So do they do that to keep your prices down?
*  They do that so you don't leave the gallery, so you don't get too big for the gallery.
*  So you don't go off on your own like you did?
*  But no, I'm loyal as fuck, dude. I'm still at the galleries that were cool. You know what I mean?
*  If the people hook me up, I'm going to hook them up. I'm going to stay there. You know what I mean?
*  But like I just wasn't getting my due at this other gallery.
*  So I decided how long had you been painting for at the time?
*  I mean, professionally, I think about 16 years.
*  Wow. But, you know, I've been doing it since I was a kid. Semi-profession.
*  Just always. Yeah. Always doing art.
*  And when did you get I want to say obsessed. That's the right word, right?
*  When I was born with Native American culture. Yeah.
*  From the time you were little?
*  There was books in my grandparents' house.
*  Like one of them was called Fighting Indians of the West.
*  And then there was like Russell and Remington books, the painters.
*  And so I just look at these photos of like Sitting Bull and I was going to say Crazy Horse,
*  but no photos of Crazy Horse, but like Geronimo and shit like that.
*  And I just saw a look in there. I like a wild person,
*  somebody who wasn't trapped by the system. You know what I mean?
*  And as a little kid, I just knew that was I knew that was better.
*  I knew it was powerful. I just really loved that. Just connected to it.
*  Yeah. It is so fascinating that so many Native Americans who got captured
*  and put into the reservation systems and then eventually like integrated with Western culture fucking hated it.
*  But when Western people, either when they were young, if they got kidnapped,
*  or if they integrated with the tribes like a lot of trappers, a lot of people integrated with the tribes,
*  when they tried to bring them back to Western society, they all wanted to leave.
*  They're like, get me the fuck out of here. I don't want to do this.
*  It's like we have this idea that cities and especially back then, I mean, you're talking about cities in the 1800s,
*  that somehow or another it was better.
*  We always have the idea that progress in terms of like what's going on right now is better than what was going on before.
*  We always have that in our head that we're doing it.
*  It doesn't seem to ring true to the human spirit.
*  There's something about human beings that they absolutely prefer that life.
*  Yeah. I mean, dude, you are more of a human being if you're living that life.
*  If you're living a life in a city where you have to go do something you don't want to do
*  and you have to go hang out with people, you really, it's like your tribe is your tribe.
*  You belong there. It's a totally just simpler, better, more real way of life.
*  I think that thing that you just said too about your tribe, because too many people today, their tribe is not someone they chose.
*  Their tribe is just people that they're stuck with because they're working with them.
*  You know, if you're working, like if you're a married person, you're a married couple and you both work,
*  you're both with other people at least eight hours a day.
*  How long are you together? You're together for a few hours at night and then you go to sleep.
*  You're tired. It's not a quality way of life.
*  But it's not the people you chose. It's the people that your occupation chose or the opportunity for employment chose.
*  And then you got to deal with these fucking schmucks in your office.
*  I've been very fortunate. I never had to work in an office my whole life. I dodged office life.
*  But I've got a lot of people that I worked with that were fucking annoying, man.
*  Just got in your way. They were always there. They're always fucking imposing their bullshit on you.
*  And if you're a person that works in an office, especially if you have a bunch of bosses,
*  the boss employee relationship is so often abused.
*  It's such an abusive place to be where you have this person that gets to tell you what to do and make you sometimes work on weekends
*  and make you like stay overtime and upset at you if you do X, Y or Z,
*  which forces you to have the same ideological beliefs as them, forces you to have the same political beliefs as them.
*  Crazy, dude. Reminds me of that movie Office Space.
*  Yes, exactly.
*  That's what I think our country is almost like right now is that motherfucker Milton.
*  Remember him? They're always kind of pushing him to the side seeing how much shit he'll put up with.
*  He's not the Stapler guy, right? That's Steven Root. That's my man.
*  That's my man.
*  He's just like, how much shit will these motherfuckers put up with?
*  Yeah.
*  And that's your life in an office. And you're taught as a kid going to high school.
*  If you do a good job here, you get to have an office job. That's what you're fucking shooting for.
*  Yeah. And you're working all day at school to try to do that. It's very complicated, man.
*  Trying to get through the education aspect of your childhood and the indoctrination aspect, because that's what it is.
*  It's indoctrinating you into believing that the only way that you can get by in this life is to become a part of this exact same system.
*  So that this is why school is structured like that. I mean, it's structured like that to teach you,
*  but it's also structured like that where you're sitting down in front of people all day long, learning things that you don't want to learn,
*  being forced to be immobile when you're a child and you're literally just a hummingbird of energy.
*  I know, those little desks.
*  Oh, it's so bad for you. The inside fluorescent lights when I was a kid, terrible for you. The whole thing, bad for you.
*  Bad feeling. I couldn't wait to run away from it. Like everything, every fiber of my being was opposed to it.
*  But they had everyone convinced that if you didn't do this this way, you're going to be a fucking loser.
*  And that's what I was convinced. I was convinced I was going to be a loser.
*  So I was like, I got to figure out a way to make money outside of regular jobs because I'm a fucking loser.
*  I can't do a regular job. I got to do a loser job. I have to be a loser.
*  I have to be a construction worker. I have to do something else.
*  I have to do something that's outside the norm because I just I can't fucking do this. I can't sit down.
*  I can't. I have too much energy. I'm so bored.
*  And it's also a terrible way to learn things.
*  Like the best way to learn things is things you enjoy, things you enjoy.
*  And then if you learn that you do something that you enjoy and you really get good at it, you go, oh, I can apply that to everything.
*  I can apply that to all things. But they don't teach you that. They teach you you got to fucking sit still.
*  You got to pay attention. You got to memorize some nonsense.
*  You got to do some shit. Do these fucking calculations that make no sense to you.
*  Like you got to you got to memorize these fucking people a distorted version of the actual history, you know, which is almost always what they're teaching.
*  Some weird distortion written by the winners.
*  And if you don't do that, you're a loser. We have such a goofy society.
*  Yeah, that's but, dude, we made it and we thought we didn't.
*  We were we were born into it.
*  Well, I mean, we like our ancestors made it.
*  Yeah, I think they were maybe they were trying to do the right thing. Maybe they had good intentions.
*  Maybe we don't know. But it turns out it's fucking stupid.
*  Why do we keep doing it? I think it's industry tricked everybody.
*  Industry gave people jobs. Jobs are easy. You know, you need to feed people. You need to eat. You need to have a roof over your head.
*  OK, here's a job this way and get a roof over my head, especially these people that came over like my grandparents did.
*  They came over from Italy. It's like these fucking they didn't know what the hell was going on.
*  They didn't know what was going on. You know, they're just like, what do I do? I'm going to feed myself.
*  What do I get a job? Get a job. Get a job. So everybody gets a job. You got to get a job.
*  Everybody get a job. Get a job. Get a job. You got to eat.
*  Because the reality of life then in the 1920s, everybody was fucking starving to death.
*  People were starving. Dudes weighed 100 pounds. No one had food.
*  It was a real possibility that you could starve to death in America.
*  People like real poor, real poor in like the 1920s.
*  And so they all just did it. And now we're still doing it. And everyone's fucking miserable.
*  And then everyone gets to not everyone. Obviously, you're not miserable. I'm not miserable.
*  Well, like the people that have dodged it. Everyone stuck in that trap is miserable.
*  They fucking hate their bosses. They hate the corporation. Can't wait to get out and talk shit about them.
*  And and they're like they're pissed off at people that got out of it. Oh, yeah.
*  Or people that are free of it. Yeah, they don't like people that are free of it.
*  They you know, like I was having this conversation with my kids about like podcasters and influencers.
*  You know, they were talking about this girl. She's making millions of dollars.
*  And it's not like here's how you have to think about that.
*  It seems ridiculous that she's doing that. But she has a product, whatever that product is.
*  She's making videos or TikToks or what have you. Someone's consuming that product. She's a business person.
*  It's just the business is ridiculously easy to get into. And the product is nonsense.
*  But you got to hand it to her for selling some bullshit.
*  She got lucky. She got born in the right time. I mean, if that lady was born in the 1970s, she'd be fucked.
*  Yeah, but she's not, you know.
*  But then then you also have to deal with like from a psychologist perspective.
*  If you talk to psychologists about growing up in this time, it's one of the most challenging times because people are inundated by other people's lives.
*  You're inundated by these people driving cars you couldn't imagine driving, living in these crazy homes, flashing money, wearing all these designer clothes.
*  Everybody's got a filter on so their skin looks perfect. They look way more beautiful than they do in real life.
*  And you're like, God damn, like, what is life? Like, what what what do I have to aspire to?
*  Like, what am I looking for? Like, what am I going to get out of this? You know?
*  You don't have meaning. You don't have a sense of belonging that you make a difference.
*  Like, that's a fucking empty, sad life, dude.
*  Yeah, it's a suck life as opposed to the life that you're living, a life of an artist, like a life that, you know, there's you.
*  You labor at these pieces that you make and then people stand in front of them and go, oh, like, do that one that you made for me.
*  The one with the guys got all the face paint like like a gray and black face paint on.
*  Do you know the one I'm talking about? Yes, dude.
*  That one that one's in my library.
*  When people walk in there to go, oh, shit, I'm going to. Yeah. Right.
*  Look at that thing. You stare at that painting. You stare at it for hours like, whoa, so much.
*  It's huge. There's so much going on in it.
*  That's what you have to do. If you're going to actually say I'm an artist, it has to stop motherfuckers in their tracks and kind of wake them up a little bit.
*  And then they can't even stop thinking about it the rest of the day because it's like, has anybody ever done that to a Jackson Pollock?
*  I mean, not unless they're on a lot of drugs.
*  Maybe that's what I'm missing. Maybe it's like a dead concert.
*  I didn't take enough LSD. Yeah, dude.
*  I guarantee you that sounds way better if you're frying.
*  Oh, I bet if you're frying, it's amazing. I bet it's amazing.
*  But can you find that photo, that painting, Jamie?
*  That's one that I have. I don't know if you're talking about Soul Catcher or Dreamer. Yeah, Soul Catcher.
*  I have that one in my house, too. That one's dope, too.
*  The one that's the one.
*  Fucking Soul Catcher. And that thing is massive.
*  That's a massive painting. It's huge. Yeah.
*  And it's sitting in my library. You can't really see all the detail on it that good because it's like a JPEG.
*  And it's kind of when you blow it up, you can't see as much. Yeah, it's not that high resolution.
*  But you know, when you look at the snake scales, dude. Oh, the snake scales.
*  But really, the thing that it gets me is always his face.
*  Just the close up of his face with all the paint and the cracked paint.
*  Fuck, I love that painting. Yeah.
*  You put your soul into it and it speaks. It's alive. Yeah, it speaks. That one speaks. Yeah. That one speaks.
*  That's what art is. It's speaking without words. It's communicating through this.
*  I mean, it's the most archaic language that we have, like those cave drawings and stuff.
*  Probably language wasn't that advanced when they were doing that, but they wanted to say something profound.
*  You know what I mean? Like they didn't have like books and poems and all that.
*  They weren't advanced as far as writing stuff down. So they'd write it down in a like a pictograph.
*  And that's how they would communicate those deeper truths.
*  And if you if you look at those cave drawings, they're always they have the same themes.
*  You know, have you looked at those? You know, I've looked at a lot of them.
*  They have a hunter and he's kind of with the animals.
*  They're going along and then there's like this big tall motherfucker with a space helmet on her.
*  There's a lot of those. Yeah. There's a lot of explain that.
*  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I don't know if if I have to, you have to just look at the fucking thing.
*  They explained it. Well, I don't know what that means.
*  You know, I really don't. I could they could have been tripping balls or it could be that when you're tripping balls, you meet those folks and they're real.
*  Yeah. That's what I was going to say. I was like the same with Grateful Dead.
*  Yeah. I've often thought about that, about UFO experiences, because I think maybe it's like a state of mind.
*  There's a state of mind that you you can achieve and you can see them, you know, not not if they're not there, clearly.
*  But I think if they're not here, yeah, then they're there.
*  But even if they're not mean they're not there all the time.
*  The idea is if there if there's something that's traveling here, but might also be if it's interdimensional, though.
*  Yeah. That's what a lot of people think.
*  It's so hard to know because it's like it's such a multifaceted story, right, because it's laced with bullshit because people are bullshitters.
*  Right. So everyone bullshits.
*  They distort something to make it more interesting.
*  They twist it up in their own mind. Even your own memory is absolutely terrible because you always want to make yourself be the hero.
*  Yeah. Or if you're like self loathing, make yourself be a piece of shit.
*  You're the villain. Yeah, you could do that, too.
*  But it's also it's just not reliable. Right.
*  So then you have this shocking thing where you're not exactly sure what happened.
*  And then your body starts filling in or your mind starts filling in the blanks with like a lot of nonsense.
*  And then you start telling it to people over and over again.
*  And then after a while, your memory is of the memory of you telling it and barely even of the UFO experience itself.
*  It's like you've told it this way for a certain amount of times.
*  So you kind of keep repeating it. Yeah.
*  And likewise, the motivation there is it now just a story you tell to get attention.
*  What makes you better? Yeah. You're a special person.
*  Aliens talk to me. Yeah, we have to always be careful of anything that makes you special.
*  Anything that makes you a special person. What makes you special?
*  Are you? Did you really see Bigfoot or are you just a fucking loser?
*  You know, like what's going on here?
*  Are you fucking just even special because you saw before he just special?
*  I think Bigfoot might be one of them things, too.
*  I think maybe I struggled with the idea that everyone's lying.
*  I really do. But I also struggle with the idea of this unknown bipedal hominid that's eight feet tall.
*  Like, where is it shitting? What does it eat?
*  Where's its bones? No one's seen it on a trail camera.
*  How's that possible? But why would everybody be lying?
*  But maybe it's smart. Maybe it fucking digs toilets.
*  You don't. I don't know. No chance.
*  Well, there's no chance it's so smart that it knows what a tram camera is, but it never made its own trail camera.
*  No chance. No chance it doesn't get photographed.
*  Bigfoot has Wi-Fi. No, too many people go into the backcountry.
*  You know, all my friends that really go deep into the backcountry, like my friends like Aaron Snyder,
*  he does these crazy backcountry hunts.
*  It'll go like 26 miles in with everything on its back.
*  And they hunt for weeks, weeks at a time.
*  And he never... None of those guys have stories like that.
*  None of them. Not one.
*  Only the people that are nervous in the woods, that don't understand the woods.
*  You know, I saw a squirrel once and for like a couple of seconds, I thought it was a wolf.
*  I thought Carl was a wolf when he's biting my leg.
*  Carl was a wolf about 14,000, 15,000 years ago.
*  They turned that into Carl.
*  No, I think you're right.
*  But you know what I'm saying? And like there's bears that stand up on two legs.
*  They do that all the time. People see that in between the trees.
*  You think you saw Bigfoot.
*  But then I wonder about like just the heightened state of mind that you're in when you're in the forest and you're scared.
*  You know, because you've been in the woods before.
*  And for people that haven't, I really recommend it.
*  Because it's so humbling.
*  There's something about just the undeniable vulnerability that you have and that you don't really mean that much.
*  You might think you mean a lot, but you're just a part of this massive system that's going on.
*  This massive system of life.
*  And if you're in that and this is a new experience for you, and then you start freaking out,
*  and then you think you saw something, and your brain goes into overdrive.
*  When your mind starts pattern forming, you start looking for things.
*  You've heard about Bigfoot. Now you start seeing Bigfoot.
*  Bigfoot!
*  Yeah. I think there's a little bit of that.
*  I'm sure a lot of people, dude, if they're getting drunk, maybe they're smoking a little weed or whatever.
*  I mean, God.
*  But then again, maybe if you are drunk or smoking a little weed, maybe you can hit that spot.
*  Maybe there's a frequency that you can hit where that motherfucker's real.
*  Where Bigfoot's really there, dude.
*  I think it's cool to believe in.
*  It's very cool to believe in.
*  If it was real, it would be really cool.
*  Some people are all in. You can't even talk them out of it.
*  They needed a hobby.
*  Like, I gotta sell some fucking t-shirts, man.
*  There's a lot of that.
*  Like Finding Bigfoot. That show. That show was hilarious.
*  How did they pull that off for like eight seasons?
*  Three or four. Eight fucking seasons.
*  How many seasons did Finding Bigfoot have?
*  It might still be going on.
*  There's a certain amount of slack-jawed people, me included, that would just sit in front of that and just like this.
*  Is that today? Is it today?
*  Like the River Monster Show and shit.
*  The River Monster Show, that guy's fishing. Fishing's fun.
*  He's just fishing.
*  That's just crazy how he just jumps down in the fucking swamp and just brings up this big demon of a fish.
*  Big tiger fish. That tiger fish. That crazy fish in Africa with the giant teeth.
*  You're like, would I do that? Would I jump off the fucking cliff?
*  The original show ended and they brought it back as the search continues.
*  We couldn't think of a better fucking title than the search.
*  The bullshit continues.
*  And there's also Bigfoot, Finding Bigfoot, further evidence.
*  Nah, further evidence. You got none.
*  And that's from 2011.
*  That's fucking way far out there.
*  I mean, it's basically printing money.
*  As long as the people that are on the TV show don't get cocky, think they deserve more money.
*  It's Bigfoot. He's behind it.
*  You might have to bring in new researchers.
*  They're never going to find me, motherfucker. Keep looking.
*  If anybody gets cocky, you might have to bring in new researchers.
*  But then the researchers have to be accepted by the research community as a legitimate Bigfoot researcher.
*  Legitimate.
*  Yes. Yes. We don't tolerate outsiders here, Greg.
*  That's a job title. No, I'm a legitimate Bigfoot.
*  Bigfoot researcher. I'm not like those bullshit Bigfoot researchers.
*  I'm just researching bullshit.
*  You know what's interesting?
*  Duncan and I went, we hung out with Bigfoot researchers when I did that TV show for Sci-Fi called Joe Rogan Questions Everything.
*  We went and hung out with these Bigfoot people.
*  And at the end you realize it's just like, oh, you guys just need a community.
*  This is a community.
*  Just needed some friends.
*  And it's a fun thing to think about.
*  And the thing about the Pacific Northwest, it's like the woods up there, if you haven't been, it's like a box of Q-tips.
*  You can't see shit through that.
*  You can't see 30 feet, 40 feet.
*  You can't see anything.
*  It's just fucking trees everywhere.
*  And how much does mushrooms have to do with Bigfoot?
*  There's a lot of mushrooms growing up there in the woods, dude.
*  You're going to see a whole bunch of shit.
*  You're going to see elves.
*  Yeah, elves, Bigfoot.
*  Leprechauns.
*  Santa Claus.
*  Santa Claus.
*  Yeah.
*  It's going to be this big party.
*  Why not?
*  Yeah.
*  Take some shirts and hang out with Bigfoot and the elves and Santa Claus.
*  But then again, like what is happening there?
*  Are you seeing things that aren't there?
*  Or are you seeing things that are there that you can't see under normal circumstances?
*  Well, dude, I think it's the latter.
*  I think it's if they weren't there, you wouldn't be able to perceive them.
*  And those substances just help you to perceive things because you're too busy over here all the time in that fucking brainwave circuit that you're kind of trapped in right here, this reality tunnel.
*  This stuff over here, there's blinders.
*  You can't see it.
*  The only way, like what happens when you take those substances, your fucking pupils.
*  Dial it.
*  They get huge.
*  And then all of a sudden, dude, I remember the first time that I really took a whole bunch of shrooms.
*  When I was a kid, me and a bunch of my friends, like we just got ahold of some bunch of money.
*  I'm not going to get into that, how that happened.
*  But you know, long story short, we turned this money into a big bag of mushrooms and we all went down to the bowling alley and ate a whole bunch of them.
*  And we just cruised around, you know, tried to go bowling.
*  That didn't work out and just shroomed out.
*  And by the end of the night, we're looking at the money that we still had.
*  And everybody's were, you know, we had a bunch of weed were passed around balls and shrooming out.
*  And we're looking at the money and we're looking at the buildings on the fucking system has us trapped with this money.
*  Let's tear it up.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  I wish I was there with you.
*  Yeah, we started tearing it up.
*  Everybody, all my friends are listening to this.
*  I would be like, he's yeah, dude, we're all there because there's probably like eight of us.
*  All my use tearing up your money, tearing up our money money.
*  You think it was we had a fuck ton of money because we just I was a little shit when I was a kid.
*  When I was a kid.
*  So I don't need specifics.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  No, I mean, right.
*  So anyway, it was enough money that it was a stupid thing.
*  We were little kids.
*  No, it's you know, we paid for it later.
*  We got we got busted a whole bunch of shit happened after that.
*  But long story short, we're ripping up ten dollar bills.
*  This is the 80s. Oh, fuck.
*  Ten bucks. Yeah.
*  And the next day you'd put it back in your pocket.
*  We like, you know, what the fuck was I doing?
*  Yeah. But I think I was right.
*  Could have went to Jimmy John's with this.
*  No, I mean, it's like but I think we tapped into something saying the system is bullshit.
*  And if we didn't tap into that, you wouldn't make it to where you did today.
*  Like the fact that I saw that and I started doing all those, you know, drugs and crazy shit when I was young is what led me here.
*  And I was getting a bunch of shit for it when I was a kid.
*  And people were saying, what do you do in art?
*  Because I wanted to do that since I was a kid.
*  That's what I was wanting to do for my career.
*  Like album covers, comic books, shit like that.
*  And people were like, no, you're crazy.
*  You're never going to fucking do anything with art.
*  But I think just being, you know, like a rebel, an outcast, that helped me.
*  That made it possible.
*  Well, it's the only way.
*  You know, if you're a person that has like some crazy corporate job and you get locked into that thing, it's going to be very difficult for you to break out and become an artist.
*  Yeah.
*  Although I actually did work for the government, for the feds for a while.
*  Which self?
*  I was an artist.
*  I was an artist.
*  No, I was a graphics guy for OSHA for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
*  So what did you do?
*  I designed all the little pamphlets and shit.
*  Like web shit.
*  Don't put your hand in the machine.
*  Don't carry stuff like this.
*  Don't do this.
*  And then they'd have me edit like pictures of people that got electrocuted and got their faces blown off and say, try to make this a little less bloody.
*  Oh, God damn it.
*  And yeah, that made me rethink.
*  Bro, there's so many videos on Instagram of people getting caught in machines.
*  You want to know the worst one?
*  The stupidest one that I ever saw was three dudes wanted to get high at work.
*  They were asphalt layers.
*  And they're like, let's jump in the asphalt mixer.
*  They fucking jumped in there to smoke a joint.
*  All of them died.
*  Like three dudes.
*  Oh, God damn it.
*  Because asphalt is deadly toxic if you breathe it.
*  It's terrible for you.
*  Oh my God.
*  But I mean, I had to kind of get into the system before I started trying to do tattoos.
*  Because I had young kids and stuff.
*  I had to.
*  And it's hard to get into the art business.
*  So I had to try to do that.
*  But then 9-11 came along and we lost our contract because all the money went to military shit.
*  And so I had to just make another plan.
*  And I tried to tattoo for a while.
*  That didn't work out.
*  And then got into fine art from there.
*  How did you get into tattooing?
*  How do you even practice that?
*  Do you practice on pigskin?
*  No, I practice on myself.
*  A friend of mine actually from Big Deluxe tattooed best shop in Salt Lake.
*  And also Anthony Bagan.
*  What's up, Anthony?
*  Didn't forget you.
*  What's up?
*  So I worked at Big Deluxe for a while.
*  My friend Rich runs that shop.
*  And he's like just a total gangster of tattooing and runs just a real tight ship.
*  I apprenticed there for a while.
*  Accidentally kicked my manager in the face and got fired.
*  How'd you do that?
*  There's a bar next door that we always would go to after work.
*  And I was over there just drunk as fuck.
*  And there's some dude in there that was trying to fight me or something.
*  And he's like, I'm going to kick your ass.
*  And so I was like, all right, go outside.
*  I'm going to finish my beer.
*  I'll be out there in a minute.
*  And I was training lots of Muay Thai at the time.
*  So I was ready to do whatever.
*  And so I walk out the door and my friend's holding the door open.
*  And I was like, where's this dude that's trying to kick my ass?
*  And he's like, right here motherfucker.
*  He takes a swing at me.
*  And I barely ducked it.
*  Went down the sidewalk.
*  I was like, all right, let's go.
*  And I thought as soon as he gets within range, I'm just going to hit him with that high kick.
*  Right.
*  And so he gets within range.
*  I throw up the high kick and I spin around.
*  And you hit your boss.
*  Because he was going, I didn't even see him.
*  Oh, no.
*  He's running out of the shop because he saw us going by the sidewalk.
*  The windows right there.
*  He's like, oh, great.
*  Come on.
*  And he goes like this.
*  Seriously, just hands out.
*  So you went full rotation on the high kick.
*  Good job.
*  Wasn't good for him.
*  It wasn't good for him.
*  It would have been good.
*  Yeah.
*  Good technique.
*  I mean, like I said, I got to train some good Muay Thai in Utah.
*  There was a couple of good schools there when I was young.
*  We're a tall dude too.
*  You know, good long kicks.
*  Yeah.
*  So that was my thing.
*  If I can hit you with a kick, say good night.
*  So he fired you for that?
*  Well, I knocked his teeth out and stuff.
*  Yeah, but you didn't do it on purpose.
*  They wouldn't believe me.
*  Oh, come on.
*  Well, I thought you were trying to hit him instead of hitting the other guy.
*  Yeah, they probably still do.
*  I didn't fucking do it, Mike.
*  Well, how hammered were you though?
*  Shit hammered.
*  So fucking hammered.
*  I couldn't even see.
*  That's why I was like, I'm just going to throw out the long kick and take him out.
*  You know?
*  But then I thought because the dude's still standing there like juggernaut and I thought
*  I hit him with my best kick.
*  So I'm like, this dude has to go.
*  Oh no.
*  And so then I'm like, all right, judo for you.
*  I fucking hip tossed him onto the concrete.
*  And I started to, you know that when you have like a big, big, big, big, big, big, big,
*  you know that when you have like a scarf hold and you should do the chicken wing with your
*  leg though.
*  So I was pushing out the hip, getting ready to break his shoulder and his fucking girlfriend
*  kicked me in the face because she was watching the fight.
*  That's the problem with the ground game in the street, bro.
*  Always, dude.
*  And so he scurries away and I ran over and grabbed him.
*  I was like, no, you don't.
*  Put him on a car, dropping elbows on him.
*  And then she wasn't done yet.
*  This dude's girlfriend was badass.
*  She fish hooked me.
*  It's like I ripped up my cheek.
*  And somehow I got her fucking finger out of my mouth.
*  And then I was like, I'm just going to kill this motherfucker now.
*  He's going to be no good to you at all.
*  And then just, you know, hit him with a bunch of knees and two dogs.
*  Goddamn bar fights are stupid.
*  That was a long, long time ago.
*  Well, you know, it all worked out.
*  Yeah.
*  Isn't it funny how those doors close?
*  Doors close in your life.
*  New door opens.
*  Well, I called up the next day and I was like, dude, I'm going to be a little late.
*  And Rich is like, no, you're going to be a little fired motherfucker.
*  You kicked Mike in the face.
*  Oh, no, I didn't.
*  I didn't.
*  I swear.
*  Oh, no.
*  But everybody's laughing about it now.
*  I'm sure those guys will get a kick out of seeing this.
*  They'll be like, oh, what the?
*  Street fights are so stupid.
*  Please, folks, if you're listening, don't do it.
*  Don't do it.
*  We all could have died.
*  We all could have died.
*  Definitely could have died.
*  And even the person who kills you, they wish they didn't do it.
*  Don't do it.
*  Yeah.
*  No, I know people that have accidentally killed people in street fights and stuff.
*  There's a guy who is a pedophile who just got caught the other day.
*  There's a bunch of these videos where these guys, they like bait pedophiles.
*  Like they bait them on social media.
*  Like the old show, To Catch a Predator.
*  Oh, right, To Catch a Predator.
*  Yeah.
*  There's a bunch of guys doing that on YouTube, right?
*  And this one guy got caught.
*  I only watched the clip of the guy getting punched and some guy walks up to him.
*  I think the dude is wearing a mask and he said something like, I got kids, motherfucker.
*  And he sucker punched this dude in the head.
*  And the dude, he's an old guy too.
*  And he falls and you hear that bang of his head bouncing off the sidewalk.
*  I'm like, oh, my God, that guy's fucked.
*  And I'm pretty sure he's dead.
*  I'm pretty sure he died, which happens.
*  I tried to follow up too.
*  I don't know.
*  You heard about it too, right?
*  Yeah. So this is it.
*  I'm not going to show it on screen.
*  So show real quick.
*  I don't know if we can.
*  Oh, it's illegal?
*  It's not our content.
*  Oh, OK.
*  Well, don't show it on the screen then.
*  There, right there.
*  Bam.
*  He's dead.
*  See, that dude bounces his head off and the other guy runs off.
*  But the sound of that guy's head hitting the concrete is just horrible.
*  And that's how people die.
*  People don't realize how strong they are if they fucking hit someone.
*  You're a full grown man.
*  Did you Google whether or not he's dead?
*  This is the follow up right here.
*  That's a video though.
*  Did you Google?
*  I read a story that said he died in the hospital.
*  I'll check.
*  How long ago was this?
*  Five days ago.
*  Yeah, I think I read a story much more recently that he died in the hospital.
*  I don't know if that's true though.
*  Because everything is just for clicks now.
*  Like Bill Marge's pointed this up that there was an article that said there's a 300% rise in measles in the United States.
*  Do you know how many cases that is?
*  35.
*  300 from nothing?
*  Yeah, well that is 300%.
*  I was like, I don't know anybody with measles.
*  I don't think I've ever met anyone with measles.
*  It's very rare these days.
*  But the fact that they wrote that in an article, a 300% rise in measles, and everybody goes into a hot panic.
*  And then you find out it's 35 people.
*  That's why, like back in the day, maybe in the fucking 50s or something, wouldn't they have jumped on that shit if it was in the newspaper and we found out about it?
*  You lying motherfucker.
*  There's just so many people bullshitting these days and we let them get away with it.
*  And they've been bullshitting since the beginning.
*  That's how weed is still illegal.
*  Weed is still illegal because of William Randolph Hearst, who ran Hearst Publications.
*  And William Randolph Hearst is the guy who started printing those stories in the paper about marijuana.
*  Marijuana was a name for wild Mexican tobacco.
*  It was a slang for wild Mexican tobacco.
*  Cannabis was like well, well known.
*  And so they started saying it was a new drug called marijuana and it was causing Mexicans and black guys to rape white women.
*  Because they would use it after work because they weren't drinking.
*  No, it wasn't real.
*  They were calling it that because they were trying to get cannabis to be left.
*  No, but I'm saying they would actually get high.
*  But they weren't doing anything.
*  They were trying to get marijuana to be illegal because they wanted hemp out of business for paper.
*  That's what it was for nylon.
*  Yes.
*  Nylon DuPont had come up with the patent for nylon.
*  And then there was also paper mills like William Randolph Hearst owned forests that they would cut down to make trees.
*  See, he owned paper mills as well.
*  And hemp paper was a superior paper.
*  And so when they came out with the decorticator, which is a machine that was much better at processing hemp fiber,
*  and they had it in Popular Mechanics magazine.
*  So they started this campaign against hemp by creating this boogeyman of a drug called marijuana that made people crazy.
*  Just so they could make money.
*  So that's the newspapers in the 30s, man.
*  So they've been doing this shit forever.
*  They've been doing this same fucking thing forever.
*  I wonder if there was ever a time when the media and the information was like working for us.
*  You know what I mean?
*  I think there's been people that have been working for us.
*  But there's always been stories that were like heavily influenced by the intelligence community and by special interest groups.
*  And it's always been the case, man.
*  Journalists have always been on the take.
*  A certain percentage of them.
*  There's a certain percentage of journalists that are just bullshit artists.
*  They're not real.
*  Because all they are is people.
*  Yeah. That's it. All they are.
*  And they're people doing a job.
*  Like that's their job.
*  They work at this place that says, hey, I want you to concoct this fucking story.
*  And they have to do it.
*  It's the same thing as like, dude, I think the whole fucking problem with the government is lobbyists.
*  When I was a little kid and I was super patriotic, like as a little kid, and I love the Constitution, I think it's just so cool.
*  The checks and balances and the way the thing is supposed to work is amazing.
*  Awesome.
*  But then I heard about the lobbyists.
*  And I remember as probably a 10 or 12 year old kid going, what?
*  And the teacher would say, yeah, yeah, it's their job to go and try to influence our senators.
*  I'm like, that don't seem right.
*  And what do they do?
*  They take them to lunch and they buy them shit to fucking convince them to make.
*  OK, get those motherfuckers out of there and then we're good.
*  Because then all they got to do is answer to me and I'm the one paying them.
*  They're trying to get extra fucking money.
*  That's the same thing as if I was like, you know, working for a gallery and then selling art on the side or some shit.
*  You can't do that.
*  I mean, you could.
*  And you know what happens?
*  Like and like customers will come up to you and say, I saw your shit at a gallery and I want to buy it directly from you.
*  And so then it's on you.
*  Is that do you have a deal like with a gallery where like if you have your stuff up in the gallery that they have to sell your stuff only through that gallery?
*  I mean, does it vary?
*  Well, yeah, because sometimes you have to you sign an exclusive and then some galleries will front you a bunch of money.
*  So every deal is different.
*  But right now I do.
*  I don't sign exclusive deals.
*  I just say, you know, you show my stuff.
*  I still sell a ton on my own on my own.
*  But you do that now because you're established.
*  Yeah.
*  But if they see it in the gallery and they come to me and they say, we saw it in the gallery, we've only seen it there.
*  And then I'll try to get the sale to go through the gallery to actually still cut them in.
*  Yeah.
*  Because that's not really right.
*  Right. That's right.
*  That's the right way to do it because they saw it in the gallery.
*  That's the whole benefit of the working relationship of you being in a gallery.
*  I mean, that's how I found you.
*  Galleries always surprise me.
*  Do it.
*  But who will you bought the painting you buy from me?
*  You had to go through the gallery.
*  I had to.
*  But I could have said, bro, fuck the gallery.
*  Just buy from me.
*  Yeah.
*  But that would be cool.
*  Right. Exactly.
*  Right. In that sense, I understand what you're saying.
*  But is there a situation with some artists where they have their pieces up in a gallery and they're not even allowed to be commissioned to make a piece outside of the gallery?
*  I think if they have an exclusive contract and they've fronted you money and if you come to them and say, hey, I haven't sold anything, can you front me some more money?
*  And they're going to take care of you.
*  OK. So it's the fronting the money is the issue.
*  That hardly ever happens.
*  OK.
*  So for the most part, like, say if I went to a gallery and I saw some piece and it was really dope and they connected me to the artist and and I get her email and I contact her and I said, hey, I really love this.
*  I'm thinking of something along this theme.
*  Can I contract you to do something like that?
*  Can I commission you to do something like that?
*  And they say yes.
*  Would she still have to go through the gallery?
*  What do you think the right thing to do is, though, for the artist?
*  I think the right thing if you find out about it through the galleries, probably go through the gallery.
*  Yeah, that makes that makes sense.
*  Yeah.
*  And then like the gallery knows you're loyal.
*  Yeah.
*  Also, galleries are dope.
*  Yeah.
*  We want to keep them open.
*  You know, like I fucking love going to galleries.
*  I just I love seeing all the different I just love different people's expressions, you know, whether it's the music or through painting or illustration or sculpture, whatever it is.
*  I'm just interested in the things people create.
*  And so if there's a place we can go and it's all just shit that people created, like I'm all in.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, I love galleries.
*  We need more of that.
*  Yes.
*  You know, we need more of that.
*  We need more encouraging people to create things.
*  You know, it's it's a very valuable commodity that's seen as frivolous until it's not.
*  It's seen as no big deal until it's worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.
*  It's a very strange world.
*  It is.
*  But like, I mean, we think about it, it's like what we were talking about earlier, how the system is so much bullshit and it's so dry and fucking empty and there's just nothing to it.
*  They have to slot you in and make you fucking toe the line and your your life so fucking boring and shit.
*  But if you get into art, whatever art it is, whether it's your music, at least you have a solace of some kind that you can come home to.
*  So I what I aspired to do was to provide powerful stuff that people that like they're out there doing crazy shit all day like you doing stuff that's affecting the world.
*  Like they're they got a bunch of stuff on their mind all the time.
*  But just for one minute, they look at that painting and they're like, now I know why.
*  I remember why I'm doing all this.
*  It's for the spirit.
*  It's for the the essence of life.
*  It's to try to make life better for all of us.
*  Yeah, you know, that's what art is really supposed to do is try to communicate to you that like you do matter.
*  We all matter.
*  We all matter together.
*  And we're not actually separate because if you can relate to this and I can relate to this.
*  Maybe we can forget about all the bullshit that they're trying to make us fight about.
*  Yeah.
*  And just fucking check out a show.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  We matter to each other.
*  Yeah, that's what's really important.
*  Even if you think you don't matter in the great scheme of things, like when people get like real morose and they start thinking about life as being futile and there's no reason why go on.
*  And generally, that's people that are disconnected from other people.
*  They don't have anybody like real close that they can hang out with that they love.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, and people need that in life.
*  It's you need you need a tribe.
*  Yeah, you do.
*  We're tribal people.
*  You need a tribe like your family should be your tribe.
*  Your friends should be your tribe.
*  You know, you need groups of people.
*  And that's a that's a wonderful life.
*  That's a joy filled life.
*  If you can have a life filled with people that you enjoy hanging out with.
*  Yeah.
*  If you do it right.
*  Yeah.
*  And those those people that think that they don't matter that they are alone, you know, don't underestimate that like the potential you have to actually affect people's lives.
*  Sure.
*  You could turn it around to how you feel right now is horrible and as dark as it seems.
*  That's not how you're going to feel always.
*  You just have to trust in this process and you got to do something.
*  It was a funny little Instagram clip that I put on my stories the other day.
*  This lady was talking about how she feels down.
*  And then someone asked her, did you get enough sleep?
*  Nope. Have you been exercising?
*  Nope. Have you been eating well?
*  Nope. Have you gone outside?
*  Nope. Have you stayed off your phone?
*  Nope. OK.
*  Why should you feel good?
*  Exactly.
*  But that's our as I say, I'm broke.
*  Did you go to work?
*  You fucking save your money.
*  Do you have people in your life that you love?
*  Do you have a thing that you do that you love?
*  If you don't have those things, you're going to have a rough time of it.
*  That's what we're here for.
*  We're here for doing things that we love or that are satisfying and being with people that we love.
*  And if you don't have those things, you're in a tough spot.
*  And the cold heart truth is for a lot of people, you have to be someone worthy of other people's appreciation too.
*  Like, what have you done? Who are you?
*  What's your character like? What do you like when you talk to people?
*  Are you nice? Are you fun? Are you good to be around?
*  Do you complain a lot?
*  You know, you want the world to be better, but you complain all the time.
*  You're just a fucking Debbie Downer. Is that what you are?
*  Because guess what? Nobody wants to be around you.
*  And you're going to be depressed now.
*  You're making people feel like shit.
*  You got to get out of that.
*  Whatever mindset spiral you're in and come up with a better way to interface with humanity.
*  Yeah, because it's it's all about perspective, dude.
*  You know, like you could.
*  I was walking around Austin earlier today.
*  I've never been here before. I was just taking a walk.
*  This is your first trip?
*  Yeah. I like I don't like I go to like art towns for shows.
*  It's all about business when I travel.
*  I'm just doing shows and going home and making more paintings.
*  But just walking around a little bit down here, I was just like, God, this really is I can look around and just see how fucking cool this place is and how all these people built all this stuff.
*  And they're building it and everybody's doing something here.
*  And I'm part of it.
*  And I get to just sit here and chill and like take it all in and go, wow, fuck, I'm in this new city.
*  They're building. They've got cranes on the tops of all the buildings.
*  The restaurants look all vital and I'd love to see that.
*  And I'm like, dude, all these people have good perspective.
*  Well, I mean, more and more.
*  It's a good vibe.
*  Right. I don't know.
*  Overall, good vibe of the city.
*  Right. Yeah.
*  I didn't know what to expect, but I was like impressed.
*  I was like, this place seems pretty cool.
*  And I realized that's my perspective.
*  I'm looking for the good.
*  Right.
*  But somebody else might be in the same exact spot and they would only notice the weird homeless dude over there.
*  They hope that he doesn't come over here and ask him for some money or they're stressing out about their bills or whatever it is.
*  And I'm just sitting here thinking perspective.
*  Look at how fucking cool life is because it really is, dude.
*  I think we've all gotten so fucked up by these little cell phones that have kind of captured us that we kind of forget.
*  Just go outside.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, go outside and experience some things.
*  It's just hard to do when you're stuck.
*  If you're at home and you're just like staring at your phone, it's hard to like put down and start moving.
*  It's hard, but you really have to.
*  It's trap.
*  It's trying to get us to get sucked into the machine, kids.
*  And it's coming.
*  And if you think it's difficult to resist now, just wait.
*  Just wait.
*  But just don't let your tolerance get all low.
*  Like, don't just keep fucking with it.
*  Like right now, go camping.
*  Yeah.
*  Right now, go learn to ride a horse.
*  I don't know about that.
*  You know, you get hurt.
*  I got some crazy horse stories.
*  I know a lot of people that have some crazy horse stories.
*  I went down to the...
*  I don't think they like to be ridden.
*  No, check this out, dude.
*  I'll tell you something funny.
*  I went down on a photo shoot to the Navajo reservation years ago, like probably about five or six, maybe seven years ago.
*  And the Apaches and the Navajos were kind of doing a peace ceremony.
*  And I was down there with like this native photographer and just a couple of friends who were all hanging out like Navajos.
*  And we ran into this Navajo family.
*  There's this dude that just got back from the military and like his little brother and his little sister.
*  And we're all just hanging out like because I just take pictures to get ideas for paintings and meet people and just go do stuff and go to the reservation.
*  That's what gives me the ideas.
*  And so I've raised riding horses and I haven't ridden a horse since I was a little kid in Montana.
*  But I learned how I knew I rode horses every day as a little kid, like 10 years old or something.
*  We'd ride them to town.
*  And so all these Indians are out there riding their horses and I want to fit in.
*  I was like, oh, jump up on one of these horses.
*  And I jump up on one of the trail horses that's been out on the trail ride all day.
*  And I have these long ass legs.
*  Everyone else is like shorter than me.
*  So the stirrups aren't long enough for me.
*  So I jump up on there and I'm all kind of off balance and the horse gets weird out and just fucking takes off at a full run across the desert.
*  Ran for like a mile, dude.
*  And I'm shitting like it's bucking me.
*  And it's like I thought about jumping off and everything.
*  Oh, my God.
*  And luckily, I had been training jujitsu at the time.
*  So I had the like the strong jujitsu grip that you get.
*  Right. Right.
*  I grabbed the saddle horn and just hold on to it.
*  I'm like, I'm not jumping.
*  I'm going to wear this motherfucker out.
*  And he ran for about a mile.
*  You didn't have a reins. You didn't have a hold of the reins.
*  I lost the reins.
*  Oh, my God.
*  He was running, dude. I wasn't ready for it.
*  He just took off.
*  But I didn't fall off. I didn't jump off.
*  Holy shit.
*  And he finally got tired.
*  And I turned him around and walked him back to where we were all hanging out.
*  Oh, my God.
*  And everyone's like, we thought we were going to be peeling you off the prairie.
*  And my horse like puts his head down and taps the ground.
*  I said, I made this fucker tap.
*  He jumped off.
*  Oh, dude.
*  Isn't it interesting that you can break horses?
*  They get wild horses and they can break them.
*  Yeah.
*  They break them and get them to the point where they can ride them.
*  It's very strange. It's a strange animal.
*  Like, yeah. I mean, dude, horses are amazing.
*  And then I got to go down to a ranch in New Mexico and learned to ride a bunch a few years ago.
*  And I got good enough where I was running and controlling the horse.
*  It's kind of like a version, a real version of Avatar when they have to hop on those dragons and they have to like merge with them.
*  They are exactly fucking like that.
*  It is like that, right?
*  Exactly.
*  Because this is like thing that's way more powerful than you.
*  But for some weird reason, you guys sync up together.
*  And if it likes you, it will like stomp out rattlesnakes for you.
*  And if it doesn't like you, it'll go over to the rocks and.
*  Yeah. Chuck you off.
*  Fuck off, bitch.
*  Yeah. You have to have a good relationship with that animal.
*  Yeah.
*  And it has to be a real relationship.
*  You can't be out of fear.
*  That animal has to love you.
*  Yeah.
*  And you have to love it.
*  It's like dogs.
*  Yep.
*  Exactly.
*  Exactly.
*  They called them sacred dogs.
*  The Lakota did.
*  But that's.
*  Yeah. A doggy ride.
*  Yeah.
*  And dogs and humans have very strange relationships.
*  Very strange.
*  You know, there's some sort of a sinking of the minds that's.
*  It's not as simple as the dog recognizes that it gets food from you.
*  No, no, no.
*  This is like this weird love.
*  Yeah.
*  You know.
*  Well, did you ever see that show that was about how.
*  Humans and canines like evolve together.
*  Yeah, I have seen it.
*  Yeah, dude.
*  I mean, I have two dogs like they're part husky, part Akita.
*  They're like.
*  They're like the primal breed.
*  So they kind of they look like wolves.
*  They kind of act like that.
*  Yeah.
*  Like, dude, those dogs are my best friends.
*  You know.
*  Yeah.
*  They pull.
*  We go around the neighborhood.
*  They pull me on my skateboard and I know that they know that I'm their friend.
*  Right.
*  And it's like.
*  I know if like if I'm having a bad day or if I'm just like stressed out or something
*  and I do this or something, they'll come right up to you.
*  What's wrong, bro?
*  I was in the gym today stretching out and I was doing this crazy back stretch and it's
*  it's kind of painful.
*  So I'm like, and next, you know, Marshall's face is like kissing me.
*  I'm like, it's all good, dude.
*  I'm just stretching.
*  And he's like, did that stretch hurt you?
*  Just want to make sure I'm OK.
*  It's just funny.
*  It's funny.
*  They just sync up to they just something about whatever that relationship is.
*  It's so unique to dogs.
*  It's so different than any other animal.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, well, it's not concerned about you.
*  Other animals, I don't think are concerned about you.
*  Like your cat's not that concerned about you.
*  I don't know if you're in pain face off if you die instantly.
*  If you like you break your leg, your cat's going to go, oh, this guy's fucking loud.
*  Let me go.
*  That fucking snap really.
*  Yeah.
*  The other day we were working out in the gym with all the comedians and Marshall was with
*  us and I started kicking the bag.
*  And he starts barking.
*  He starts jumping up and down and barking because he thinks like some shit's going down.
*  Is that bag fucking with you?
*  What's happening here?
*  I know.
*  That's hilarious.
*  Like all the other stuff that we did with all his kettlebell workouts, we pushed the
*  sled.
*  That was all fine.
*  But once I started hitting the bag, he's like, what the fuck is going on?
*  They can tell the difference, dude.
*  They could tell the difference between like actual violence.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  They understand what violence is.
*  It's weird.
*  It is.
*  It's like, how does he why is that different to him than me lifting a thing or me grunting
*  or pushing a sled?
*  Like, well, I don't understand.
*  That's totally why we kept him around because we're like, as soon as shit starts to go down,
*  you jump in.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm going to get my knife.
*  Yeah.
*  Take care of you.
*  Hit him low.
*  I'll hit him high.
*  They know that they're with you.
*  Yeah.
*  They have to protect you.
*  That you like that happens with people, you know, if they get in some sort of a school,
*  like brothers and sisters getting fights together.
*  The dog fucking tries to jump in.
*  Yeah.
*  It happens all the time.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, if two girls are beating the shit out of each other and the dog jumps in.
*  Just at a party, dude.
*  How many times have you seen that?
*  So he's just pushing and shoving the pit bulls got your arm.
*  Oh, no.
*  And then you got nerve damage.
*  No.
*  Just like fucking playing.
*  You get bit by a fucking alligator.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, dude.
*  Those fucking things.
*  Yeah.
*  They don't understand that either.
*  Especially dudes.
*  They get a little too loud when they're playing.
*  Yeah.
*  The dogs are like, oh, some shit's going down.
*  The dogs are like, you think so?
*  Yeah.
*  Motherfucker.
*  This isn't your house.
*  This is my house.
*  And I'm not drunk.
*  They don't get the rules.
*  They don't get the rules of engagement.
*  That thing in the avatar is so wild when they sync up and they link their tails to their
*  hair thing.
*  Yeah, his pony tail.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It really is kind of what happens with a horse.
*  Well, everything is kind of based on something.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like fiction stuff.
*  You get that idea from somewhere.
*  Haven't people said that avatars like Pocahontas in space?
*  I thought they said it's like Dances with Wolves from space.
*  I think both.
*  And that pissed me off.
*  Well, because my mentor, a friend of mine, wrote Dances with Wolves.
*  Oh, really?
*  He's like one of my best influences that guided me in my career.
*  Michael Blake.
*  He's a bro, dude.
*  It wasn't about, they say, oh, the white savior story.
*  He's coming to save the Indians.
*  That's some bullshit.
*  I'm like, did you watch the fucking movie?
*  Who saved who?
*  The white guy didn't save the Indians.
*  They saved him.
*  There.
*  He learned from the Indians how to be a good person.
*  There's nothing wrong with that fucking story.
*  I barely remember that movie.
*  I remember it was really good, but I barely remember it.
*  Well, he told me that microphone.
*  Sorry, sorry, sorry.
*  It moves around.
*  Yeah.
*  He told me that he came up with that idea by he heard a story where a supply train,
*  a wagon train pulled up to like an abandoned camp, a civil or not civil, like an army camp.
*  He heard that story and he thought, well, what would I do if I was that guy?
*  Would I just go back to the base, to the army base or would I stay there and try to figure out what happened?
*  And he said, he just came up with the whole thing based on putting himself there in his imagination.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  This is such a cool motherfucker, dude.
*  Like I remember I was saying, you know, this is years ago.
*  I said, I want to be the next Howard Turpin, which is like the big Western artist.
*  He's like, no, dude, don't be the next anything.
*  Be the first Greg Overton.
*  Just be you.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, and here in that, like the that movie was a big influence on me because when I saw that and got a Howard Turpin book,
*  that's what really got me back into Western art.
*  Because as a as a teenager, I was doing all the punk art.
*  I could did album covers for a lot of the bands from Salt Lake and was trying to draw comic books and shit like that.
*  But as soon as I saw that movie and got the Howard Turpin book, that's what really brought me back to the Native American stuff.
*  And I was like, this is what I'm going to do.
*  I think what's so interesting about the Native Americans, one of the things that's interesting, I should say, about the Native American stuff is that we didn't really understand what was even happening until the 20th century.
*  And now the 21st century.
*  We didn't really have an understanding of like how their cultures worked and how they interacted with each other.
*  The way it was depicted in mainstream media was always cowboy and Indian movies.
*  It was like this very crude kind of simplistic version of what they did.
*  We didn't really understand much about Native American culture until people started started writing these like Empire of the Summer Moon, some of these amazing books.
*  Well, you get a real understanding of like what like Black Elk Speaks, like those kind of things.
*  We you actually hear from the people that live that life.
*  Like what was that like?
*  Because our version of it was all just stupid movies, John Wayne movies and shit.
*  And then Clint Eastwood took it to another level, like especially the outlaw, Josie Wales.
*  Yeah.
*  When he meets that Comanche guy and 10 Bears.
*  Yeah. And him and 10 Bears have this conversation about what's going to go down.
*  You know, your words have ironed.
*  Yeah.
*  Words of death.
*  Also my words of death.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a heavy scene.
*  Will Sampson.
*  That's like, yeah, that's one of the best movies ever, dude.
*  That's a great fucking movie.
*  That's a great fucking movie.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a fun movie.
*  But that's that's like the real Comanche, Texas Ranger, because he was a Texas Ranger type dude.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Those are those are both just awesome icons of the West.
*  We should respect both of those.
*  Yeah.
*  Because neither one of them were like a hero or a villain purely.
*  I mean, the Comanche, they were a fucking empire.
*  They were they were out for conquest.
*  They're colonizing the fuck out of they took all the horses and they're like, fuck you.
*  We're taking it.
*  Yeah. They committed raids on other Native American tribes all the time.
*  I mean, they were they were ruthless.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, we've talked to us before with just the name Sue.
*  That wasn't their name.
*  Then that was the name for enemy.
*  Yeah.
*  Their name was the Lakota people.
*  That's what they called themselves.
*  But everybody else called me enemy.
*  Yeah. They're fucking everybody up because there was no unity amongst Native American tribes.
*  I mean, it was really no different than the interactions that we have with other countries.
*  Like sometimes you're connected to them and you your allies and sometimes you're at war.
*  And sometimes it's the same groups of people that you used to be allies and now you're at war or you used to be at war.
*  And now you're allies.
*  So, yeah, United States and Japan.
*  Yeah. Example, you know, I mean, that's probably one of the best examples in modern times.
*  Yeah. Literally dropped indiscriminate nuclear bombs on two other cities.
*  And now we buy their cars.
*  I know. Imagine if you did that to one of your friends.
*  Sorry, I nuked your fucking house.
*  Let's go see a movie.
*  80 years ago, dude. Let it go.
*  I just nuked your fucking house.
*  Come on. Let it go.
*  You wouldn't stop fighting, bro.
*  Apparently they're like, dude, you didn't get our memo. We were going to stop fighting.
*  You guys just want to try out your fucking bomb.
*  Yeah. You just want to flex.
*  No, no, no. We wouldn't do that.
*  You just want to flex your fucking nuke power and you still want to go on vacation in fucking Europe, bitch.
*  Imagine seeing the first nuke go off and realize that nothing's ever going to be the same again.
*  When they drop that first nuke in a city, just like, oh my God, what have you done?
*  What have you done? And what precedent have you set?
*  It's really truly amazing that we haven't done it since then.
*  Yeah. That's what makes you believe in the aliens and multi-dimensional beings and shit.
*  Really?
*  Isn't it just mutual destruction as well?
*  No, no. I'm saying like when humanity got all the nuclear bombs and shit,
*  that's when you start to see all the sightings and stuff.
*  So that's why it kind of makes sense that they'd be like, oh, what are you doing?
*  We can't let you blow up your whole fucking planet before you even evolve to your first level.
*  Because for all we know, we're still white belts.
*  Right. Well, leaf cutter ants have no idea that you have a car.
*  They have no idea. They have no idea what a Bitcoin is.
*  They have no idea what 4G is. They don't know shit.
*  They know about cutting leaves and being ants.
*  Right. But they're around it all the time.
*  It's very possible that there's some shit like that in other dimensions that are equally bizarre
*  that we are not connected to all the time. And they might be here all the time.
*  And if that's the case, then it makes sense that they would start showing up
*  when we were in the middle of dropping nukes on each other.
*  They'd be like, hey, hey, hey, hey.
*  It'd be like when your parents heard you just beating the shit out of each other in the other room.
*  They'd come in and they're like, all right, fucking settle down.
*  Settle down, boys.
*  You're going to fuck up the drywall now.
*  Yeah. You guys are crashing into fucking TVs and shit.
*  You're like, hey. That's all it is. We're just there dumb kids in the next room making a bunch of noise.
*  Because maybe they needed to let us know, like, hey, there's some other folks here.
*  And they're way more advanced and settle the fuck down.
*  We're trying to bring you along. Just, you know.
*  The problem is with all that stuff is it's so hard to know what's true and what's bullshit.
*  Just like the Bigfoot thing. It's so hard.
*  Well, the Bigfoot thing is way easier, right?
*  But the UFO thing, there's way more evidence.
*  It's so hard to know what's bullshit.
*  This is so hard. It's so hard to know who's telling the truth and who's lying.
*  It's so hard to know what involvement the government has in terms of like how many of these things are drones.
*  You know, you're hearing now that a lot of these people that believe that these things are flying around,
*  they think that what we're dealing with is some sort of a government drone.
*  And that a lot of this off-world craft talk is really just misinformation so that they don't have to take accountability
*  for having some crazy thing that China doesn't have or maybe China has that we don't have.
*  And then they want to lie about it, you know, and try to develop whatever the fuck they have.
*  Yeah. And when you find out what they're really doing,
*  then it's like, OK, now this makes sense. Now that makes sense because you're having to fucking do all this to develop that.
*  Well, you know, there's a whole conspiracy about the invention of the transistor
*  because the transistor came about right after Roswell.
*  And there's a company called Bell Labs.
*  And Bell Labs was, I believe they were the people that invented the transistor.
*  And there was a military base right outside of Bell Labs.
*  And they had always said that military base was to protect New York City.
*  But it's pretty far from New York City.
*  Like if you wanted to protect New York City, put a base a lot closer.
*  You wouldn't you wouldn't put it so far away or take him like 40 minutes to fly there.
*  Yeah. But Bell Labs is a wild place.
*  And that was one of the main focal points of conspiracy theorists when they were talking about back engineering stuff
*  from crashed UFOs was fiber optics and transistors and that they all came about very shortly after Roswell.
*  And people don't exactly know how they figured those out.
*  They probably those were probably the like the most basic things that they recovered.
*  So they are the easiest to figure out. So that's why we had them first.
*  And there's like it's just like those fucking PlayStations.
*  And they release a better one every few years.
*  Maybe they had PlayStation five and ninety five, but they're still giving us PlayStation one because they want to sell all five.
*  Well, they can't just give us a time machine. Yeah.
*  They have to give us a spaceship first. Yeah.
*  Like first of all, you got to figure out travel, you morons.
*  And we won't even need a fucking spaceship once we got a time machine.
*  Yeah. Then we'll give you the Big Bang machine. Yeah.
*  That takes time. You got to get to a higher level civilization.
*  Have you heard of a Dyson sphere? Do you know what a Dyson sphere is?
*  I've heard of it. What is it? I don't know.
*  It's a massive structure that some astronomers believe could indicate highly advanced intelligent life somewhere in the universe.
*  They've never been discovered, but they've been theorized that these there was this article that I was reading yesterday about it.
*  If you see if you can find so it can like tell you where it would be.
*  They think they're massive structures that are like literally like a structure the size of a solar system.
*  And somebody made that and those fucking things are out there.
*  Well, this was this is just theorized right when they were talking about the highest potential level of technological ability that you could get to.
*  Yeah. I mean, imagine if you got to a place where you had a self-contained solar system that's completely controlled by these intelligent beings, but that's immune to all of the hazards.
*  What if we're in that motherfucker? We might be. That's the simulation.
*  We might be. We might be.
*  And Thanos is like a type two civilization, one that can directly harness harvest rather the energy of its star using a Dyson sphere or something similar.
*  So it like is solar powered basically.
*  Well, I don't know what the fuck it is. I mean, I think it's totally theoretical.
*  There's no there's no real versions of them that are out there.
*  But the idea is that if technological proficiency and innovation continues at the level that it is now for millions of years, what does it get to?
*  But you know what? It's probably going to get weird in that because the shit you can imagine like remember the 80s when you fucking had a Walkman.
*  Right. Whoa. What are they going to have in a few years?
*  Right. I'll be able to you know, you probably thought it was still going to be a cassette tape like when you watch the fifth element or Blade Runner.
*  They're still using fucking telephones. They didn't even think of cell phones.
*  Right. But that's our most obvious thing that we have right now.
*  Star Trek. They had a walkie talkie. Yeah. Kirk out. Right.
*  Because you're still like relating it from like 1960 military space.
*  Yeah. Right. Exactly. That's not that's Paul.
*  And so it's going to fucking God of War.
*  Mm hmm. Holy shit. It's going to keep going.
*  That's what I think artificial intelligence is.
*  I think and this is a I don't really think this is just a thought.
*  Maybe the universe is God and maybe the way God is created is through intelligent life.
*  That intelligent life creates a far superior version of itself in artificial intelligence.
*  And that creates a far better version of itself infinitely.
*  They just keep making better versions of itself as it has more of an understanding and more capacity and it grows and it makes better versions of itself.
*  It's eventually going to get to godlike powers.
*  The power to create universes, the power to create solar systems, the power to stop time,
*  reverse time, the power to traverse immense distances, instantaneous.
*  It'll just have it'll have capabilities that we could only imagine.
*  We could always just we just imagine if and it can do that.
*  Yeah. If we look at how we're living right now in comparison to how people were living when they were making those those cave paintings like wow.
*  Yeah. Same case paintings to fucking.
*  It's not going to stop right here. Yeah. But what's the things they can do the 3D printing 3D printing.
*  Yeah. That's fucking crazy. No it's the same.
*  I mean we know that's what they think the spaceships are made out of now.
*  Yeah. Like when Bob Lazar was first examining if he's telling the truth when Bob Lazar was first examining the spaceships the thing that blew him away was there's no seams didn't make any sense.
*  Like how could one even make something like this.
*  Well now that we know there's 3D printers and you could make something like that.
*  Yeah. You could. I mean I don't think you can make it that scale yet.
*  But if you had enough of a capability you had machines that could do it.
*  Yeah. I mean if we thought of it. Yeah. And we're doing it and they're fucking right 60 million light years ahead of us.
*  Right. Like who's to say they're not. Who's to say they're not 60 thousand years ahead of us.
*  Six hundred thousand or six million.
*  Or like think about if you have a fucking time machine you could go back to check out some shit that already happened but you could also go forward.
*  I mean we just have no comprehension of what you could.
*  Maybe you could like start a project in your lab.
*  Right. And then travel and you get all these fucking AI robots to work on it and then you travel way forward in time and go get it and then bring it back.
*  And then it's the fucking ultimate thing.
*  You know like that's what I'd be doing if I had time machines I'd be like all right I'm going to get all these fucking helpers to build these awesome monuments and then I'm going to go in forward in time and check on it.
*  All right. Did you. You know like it would just give you if you could manipulate time and travel through time like it's an element like did you have your.
*  But you wouldn't be able to experience it because like you would always be involved in time being manipulated so there'd be no static time.
*  So even in this static time something could intervene instantaneously always for forever.
*  What if we don't really understand the nature of time to make those definitions what if you could if you could get this time machine what if you could kind of like step out of time in a lot of different ways that you don't think.
*  Right. You know what I'm saying. Right right right. Like you could go into a timeline and you don't even necessarily affect that timeline.
*  If you know how to just observe it. Right. And not like physically disturb it. But you do is affected if you go forward in the future.
*  The idea of a time machine the current idea of a time machine is that you can't travel where there are no roads.
*  So once a time machine is invented then everything from that time that time machine is invented forward becomes a completely different way of using time because time now is nonlinear.
*  Time now anyone. So everything happens all at once. So people from the future will be traveling back to the moment where the first time machine is invented.
*  So everything will change instantly because if you're going to you're going to invent a time machine and you live a million years in the future assuming that humans even exist if a time machine gets invented I mean we might become obsolete almost instantaneously.
*  But if you would if you were alive human being a million years after the time machines invented you would want to go back to the moment the thing was made.
*  You'd want and so the moment they turn that motherfucker on everything changes forever. Yeah singularity. Yeah that might be the real singularity.
*  That was one of the McKenna's theories. Terrence McKenna believed that we were going to come up with a time machine.
*  He thought that was going to happen around December 21st 2012. Well have you checked out his time we've zero.
*  Yeah yeah. And you know how they came up with that those Taoist priests and shit. How did that the fucking each thing do they go into deep meditations and they would take mushrooms too.
*  And they found out that that time can be mapped and like predicted that's where the fucking each thing comes from. People in the 60s got all into the each thing.
*  Each thing is like a game right. No it's a it's a book. It's made up of. I'm not like an expert on but isn't there a game that's involved with the each thing that McKenna sort of patented that's time we've time of zero on.
*  I don't I don't know if he made a game of it but it's not each thing a game. It's like a fortune telling right. That's what it's like. It's like a form of divination divination right.
*  Yeah it is like a fortune telling thing. That's what it is. It's not a game. Yeah I was trying to remember how he I haven't heard his stuff in a long time.
*  Try to remember how he described it but most people that have looked at time we've zero think it's kind of nonsense including guys like Paul Stamets like he's he's probably tripping real hard.
*  We came up with that. I don't know. I think it's above their head. It might be. I think it also is a ridiculous thing to subscribe to.
*  So a lot of people are reluctant to like open their self up to ridicule. But so is everything. Everything's ridiculous.
*  Everything's ridiculous. What's what's what's all these like religions and everything that everybody fucking is into. Everything's ridiculous.
*  Nothing is Taoism and time we've zero isn't any more ridiculous than anything else that people are fucking tarot cards.
*  It's I think it's really interesting because those I really get into ancient Chinese culture like I was into you know Kung Fu at a young age.
*  So I've studied a lot of Chinese philosophy Taoism all that stuff. Those people are highly intelligent spiritual people who were doing deep meditations and discovering really profound truths.
*  You know I think that we are at a level where we're so intellectual that we're almost too intellectual.
*  So it's almost like we can only we can only think about things in this scale like people see in a certain frequency they can only see certain lights but like dogs can hear sounds we can't hear others.
*  So it's just like that. It's like our fucking intellect is like this and we can figure out.
*  But because we exist within the context of our culture because we've fallen in love with this. Right.
*  But there's also this and your heart your your spirit that that's what figured out the Tao to chain.
*  That's what figured out you know how to tame horses and be one with them and domesticate primates.
*  It wasn't just us thinking cerebrally. That's like that's kind of limited.
*  I think our our real being is deeper than that. You know what I mean.
*  I think you can learn and know things because I don't think about my ideas for art.
*  I don't try to come up with them intellectually. I just meditate.
*  I wait for it to find me and that's not an intellectual practice.
*  Right. You know but obviously it yields results right. So it's the right way to do it.
*  Yep. Meanwhile people wouldn't think about that. They would think oh like what's the straight.
*  How do you do this. You you add these boards and that's how you make a house.
*  They want to see switches and that's how you make a computer. Exactly.
*  Yeah. That's why like Bruce Lee innovated martial arts because he said let's kind of break down all these systems.
*  Let's not adhere to these. Right. He called it organized despair.
*  All the karate forms and just doing your sparring and not really doing live training is a threshold that you don't want to cross.
*  So you're stuck in this like let's go through all these boring stupid rituals to try to prop up our bullshit society when it's like no I think we've taken intellect as far as it's going to go.
*  I think if we're going to get to the next level we have to go deeper this way.
*  And you know I think it should be both. Right.
*  And I think the problem is that with money and with capitalism and our society and what our reward system is based on it rewards people going towards the things that are going to get you results that you could show other people.
*  You know houses and cars and stuff like that. Like a quick result.
*  Well like a physical tangible thing that's measured and cherished by society as opposed to spiritual growth.
*  You know we don't think of spiritual growth as being like it's almost like frivolous pursuit of silly people.
*  I'm working on my spiritual growth. She fucking lazy bitch. Like what are you doing.
*  What are you actually doing. You're sitting around eating fucking cookies. Yeah.
*  Yeah. Do you know self love. OK.
*  So down.
*  Maybe you love yourself too much. Yeah.
*  Maybe think about yourself too much. There's so many other things to think about.
*  You know and it's just we have a very complex society that has a gravity to it and it sucks you in and it makes you a part of it and you don't have a whole lot of say you get locked in and you get locked in when you're real young get indoctrinated in the education system and then you get outside of it and you have to make a living and take care of yourself and pay your bills.
*  You get locked in. You know while space in while space is happening right above you and every now and then you're forced to see it like I don't know if you guys got any of the northern lights from the solar storms like one you get it. Yeah.
*  What was it like. Just I mean I didn't see it. My daughter is just sending me pictures of it. Yeah.
*  My buddy lives in Montana and he was sending me photos of what's going on. Jamie your buddy in Ohio right. Well yeah. My friends in Ohio saw it so.
*  Yeah. Yeah it's wild. It's crazy how that just happened all over the place. Well we knew about it. We knew they were coming because there's two different types of radiation that comes from those storms when they have this big coronal mass ejections.
*  One of them reaches us in seconds. I think that's that's gamma waves. Is that what that is that reaches us in seconds. And then the second one takes days to get us and that's the one that can take out your cell phone towers and fuck up communications and shut down the grid.
*  And if it gets big enough we're really doomed. Yeah we have a very very vulnerable system and we're essentially living in a house with a glass ceiling hoping that it doesn't hail.
*  Don't help me sleep good at night. Right. If you park your car outside you know if most of the time your car is fine most of the time it doesn't hail. But if it hails your car's glass ceiling on that car your car is going to get fucked up.
*  I'm sure you've seen like damage that hails caused to people's cars. Yeah. Fuck man. And that is an unpredictable thing that happens way more often than these massive solar ejections. But if they get big enough they get big enough we're fucked.
*  If they get big enough we are back in the caveman days kids. I mean we still have books and we'll be reading them by candlelight but all refrigeration is gone. You're going to have biodiesel generators. You're going to have to start making beef jerky.
*  Oh yeah yeah yeah. You're going to need beef jerky. You're going to need water purification tablets. You know you're going to need someone who can figure out how to make those water for purification tablets without electricity. Someone to test the water on before you drink it.
*  Bro. You need a whole bunch of shit. It could get real squirrely. What is when they have a coronal mass ejection what is there's two different types of. I know I'm very I'm lost in this in the science of it. It says that all the first it said all waves travel at the same speed which I was like OK that's not what we're looking for right here.
*  They all travel at the speed of light. The waves do visible or gamma right. So those reach us in a few seconds but then I'm seeing they end up traveling up to a million miles a second. Whoa. So that's why I'm like I'm trying to find out which waves are the ones we're talking about then. So how many million miles away is that faster than light million miles a second.
*  In my head I was about to do that calculation next. I think it is but really. It's the speed of light is like it's something meters per second. This is how we figure out time travel. These motherfuckers it's like two hundred seventy eight thousand meters per second or something.
*  I guess that could be close to a million miles per second. Either way that motherfucker is not stable to that son. I mean it's fairly stable but every now and then it'll blow a gasket and you get just crazy waves headed towards us though.
*  So I have a really crazy friend that just might fucking freak out. Yeah. One moment to a bar. PTSD is on LSD. No he's a good dude. I swear. What was the worst version of it. Wasn't there something that happened that took out like Morse code towers in the 1800s.
*  I think there was one big historical mass ejection that was documented within the last couple hundred years that they say if it happened today we would be really fucked that the same thing if it happened today. The Carrington event is what it's called.
*  The Carrington event is what it's called. The most intense geomagnetic storm in recorded history. When was that one? September 1st and 2nd of 1859. And so the Carrington event most intense geomagnetic storm recorded history peaking from 1 to 2 September 1859 during solar cycle 10 created strong auroral displays that were reported globally and caused sparking and even fires in multiple telegraph stations. Yeah.
*  So like what the fuck would that do today. So it just blows up everything that has electricity in it. Yeah it just cooks everything. Dude what if everybody's car just blew up. Everybody's fucking house just blew up. Oh yeah it probably would. Probably cook your fucking computer in your car.
*  September 1st as Carrington was sketching on sunspots he was blinded by a sudden flash of light. Carrington described it as a white light flare according to a NASA space flight. The whole event lasted about five minutes. The flare was a major coronal mass ejection.
*  A burst of magnetized plasma from the sun's upper atmosphere. The corona. In 17.6 hours the coronal mass ejection traversed over 90 million miles between the sun. Okay that's the distance between the sun and the earth. 150 million kilometers.
*  And unleashed its force its force on our planet according to NASA space flight. It usually takes CMEs multiple days to reach earth. The day after Carrington observed the impressive flare earth experienced an unprecedented geomagnetic storm with telegraph systems going haywire and auroral displays normally confined to polar latitudes visible in the tropics according to NASA science. Carrington put two and two together and realized that the solar flare he'd seen was almost certainly the cause of the solar eclipse.
*  The solar eclipse is the cause of this massive geomagnetic disturbance. This was a connection that had never previously been made according to NASA space flight. The solar storm of 1859 is now known as the Carrington event in his honor. Wow. So if that happened today. What Google what would happen if the Carrington event happened today.
*  Let's find out what happened. Cell phone just blows up. Oh probably it probably cooks everything. But that's what's really scary is that all of our cars are controlled by computers unless you have an old car that has a carburetor you're fucked.
*  Unless you have an old ass you know 1988 Toyota truck you're in you're in a bad spot.
*  Right there. What would happen with a Carrington event today. People ask. First one click on that. As such Hudson suggested that a solar flare on the level of Carrington event might not pose as big a threat to humankind as some fear still a Carrington event pointed at Earth today would have substantial impacts mainly on human activities in space.
*  Also wouldn't kill our grid. I think they're just fucking guessing. Yeah they don't want to freak people out. Oh I don't know.
*  Because if it's never happened how do you know what would happen. Also that one the Carrington event. We don't really totally know how big it was. Right because they didn't have the instruments to measure it back then. And what if there's one that's double that. If that can happen something bigger can happen.
*  I mean it's not. We've only been around a short amount of time. The fucking sun's been around for billions of years. Like how long is it every now and then it shoots off a big wad of jizz and blasts us with some plasma.
*  It destroys all our technology. He's just up there. You know when they first started observing gamma ray bursts in the universe they thought that there was wars going on in space.
*  Yeah when they first started detecting these gamma ray bursts they found that they were happening like every couple seconds all over space. And they were reading too much science fiction. No they realized. They didn't know what it was. Like what are these bursts. And then they realized there's something called hypernovas.
*  So if a hypernova like if our sun goes hypernova that's a wrap. That's a wrap for everything. It just blows up. Yeah but it cooks the whole solar system. And that's what they're detecting all over the place. Yeah. So suns are always fucking blown up. Yeah.
*  Well there's so many of them. Eventually they reach the end of their life cycle and if they hypernova if they're big enough and they have enough mass and they hypernova that's a wrap for the whole solar system. Fuck.
*  Yeah like I think it's a wrap for other solar systems that are close by too. I think it's a wrap for like pretty much everything. But maybe you like you get to that point where you know.
*  You know Jamie cat captures a supernova hypernova is actually even bigger than a supernova. So this is a national the Hubble telescope captured a supernova. But there was a thing was a science channel had this documentary on hypernovas where these people were talking about how when they first started measuring them they were like oh shit.
*  Like because this is like post World War 2. We understand atomic bombs like what do these guys have. These guys are blowing up whole planets out there like oh fuck. Imagine thinking that the universe is teeming with life and that life is so violent that it's blowing up planets.
*  Yeah. Total Star Wars shit. Yeah you'd have to if you were that scientist you just have to be like holy fuck. What do I tell people. Yeah. And you wouldn't do you probably wouldn't want to tell them that but you'd have to tell like the generals.
*  I would think there might be fucking Star Wars going on. I'm sure they had meetings. I'm sure they had me when they when they first detected these things. I'm sure they were like oh Jesus Christ. OK Mr Eisenhower we've got some problems.
*  We're going to do. We might not be shit after all. Yeah. Well we're something to us. But in the greater scheme of it all. I mean the universe doesn't seem to care if it cooks entire solar systems. Yeah. Every couple seconds.
*  Well because I mean the universe has to know more than we do. So we're over here thinking we're all bad ass. How do we know it's not better if you get zapped and then you fucking right here in a different dimension. That's probably what happens. Yeah. What are hypernovas.
*  I'm going to show you this one I was just finding on this video about the largest supernova ever. SN 1572 which I guess that's the year. So it was said it was visible for 23 days. Oh my God. 362 nights. Wow. So then like I'm watching the video. This is non scientific. It could look like a you know a star planet that wasn't actually there if they were observing it for so long. It would have ended up in a book.
*  I don't know what they thought was going on. It was a supernova back then. Like how much did they know about that. How big did they say they saw. Did they talk about it. Well I'm trying to just go off without listening to them. Just going off pictures and words and stuff. Not quite sure though. You imagine living back then. You see some fucking flare in sky. They look. Yeah they were looking at that bullshit telescope.
*  He puts his eye up to it and it just fries his fucking eye out. Oh right. Imagine. Yeah those dummies are just standing. He's looking right at the super. Did you watch the eclipse. The last one. Yeah. You didn't see it. No. No. Oh my God. It was wild man. It was weird. I saw the one before that I was down in Santa Fe. Oh yeah. So I was outside but I can't remember what I was doing. I was like oh there's an eclipse. That's how out of touch I am. Well this was such a big one that everybody was preparing and you know roking it. I was like oh yeah. I'm going to go to the next one.
*  I was like oh yeah. I'm going to go to the next one. I was like oh yeah. I'm going to go to the next one. I was like oh yeah. I'm going to go to the next one. I was like oh yeah. I'm going to go to the next one. I was like oh yeah. I'm going to go to the next one. I was like oh yeah. I'm going to go to the next one. I was like oh yeah. I'm going to go to the next one. I was like oh yeah. I'm going to go to the next one. I was like oh yeah. I'm going to go to the next one. I was like oh yeah. I'm going to go to the next one. I'm going to go to the next one. I'm going to go to the next one. I'm going to go to the next one. I'm going to go to the next one. I'm going to go to the next one. I'm going to go to the next one. I
*  the one that seems weird to out they go how is what are the odds is there any other planet in our solar system. The experience is that yeah no biggest surprise. No one no one's like that yeah and yeah it's the one planet that has intelligent life is the Python and PowerPoint that'sinku net.
*  moon.
*  And what does that do?
*  Like, I don't know, man.
*  Maybe it's superstitious or something, but I think those cosmic cycles.
*  I think it's a reminder.
*  I think it's certainly a reminder of just the vastness and bizarreness of space itself
*  when you realize, oh, there's a giant nuclear explosion in the sky that keeps the lights
*  on.
*  Yeah, and then there's this other-
*  And then it gets blocked.
*  Yeah, the other fucking rock that just blocks it out is perfectly sized and shaped.
*  And that rock is also perfectly sized to give us a stable gravity.
*  We're not wobbling enough so that we don't vary too much in our temperature.
*  It keeps us stable because it's pretty big.
*  That moon's pretty fucking big.
*  And the tides and everything.
*  All that shit.
*  It's all very weird.
*  What the ant-eclipse of one of the moons of Mars looks like.
*  It's so small and doesn't fit perfectly.
*  Yeah, it doesn't fit perfectly at all.
*  It just goes across it.
*  So that's the shadow that it casts, that weird-
*  Yeah.
*  I wonder if there's, are there any other planets in the solar system that would experience
*  an eclipse that's similar to ours?
*  I was trying to just look at that.
*  I was thinking Saturn's got multiple moons, zero anyway.
*  It kind of would have to be-
*  They all line up at one time.
*  Right, it would have to be a moon.
*  One of them would have to line up and it would have to be the same size as the sun in terms
*  of how it fits in the sky, the distance so that it's the perfect size to block it out.
*  It's so perfect.
*  All you see is as it passes over, you just see the outside light.
*  You see this black circle in the outside light.
*  And there's a weird ring.
*  It's perfect.
*  Yeah.
*  It's perfectly established to give us an eclipse.
*  It is weird when you think about it.
*  It is, but the whole thing's weird.
*  It's probably one of the least weird things about space.
*  Yeah.
*  I had an astronomy class in high school and that class would just trip me out hearing
*  about how infinite and the white dwarves and the pulsars and all the shit that's out there
*  that they can see so far out there is wild.
*  And then I got really sad when Eddie said space is fake.
*  I don't think he's an expert.
*  I'm like, Eddie, I just...
*  Because you beat Hoyler, I'm going to listen to you.
*  There's some real interesting stuff that's going on now where they're finding galaxies
*  that are so far away and are so far formed, they're so well formed that they don't think
*  that they should exist given the timeline of the universe.
*  They're very confused as to how these things exist, where they exist, that they shouldn't
*  have been formed in this way.
*  It's one of those fucking things.
*  Well, I think what it is is it's probably the universe is probably older than we think
*  it is.
*  I think they're just with the web telescope, they're just starting to be able to detect
*  these structures in deep space that they're so far away and they're so old that they shouldn't
*  be able to exist if the Big Bang happened 13.7 billion years ago.
*  Maybe they found a way to stabilize themselves.
*  Like if you're...
*  Because you got to think, like if you're the right place, the right time, your technology
*  advances high enough before you destroy yourself, maybe you don't have a planet where everybody
*  likes to kill each other and you have world wars every fucking hundred years, and you
*  don't nuke whatever and you build your technology in a good way, maybe you could stabilize it
*  so a fucking Big Bang happens and you got some time wave zero shit that...
*  That's the least likely.
*  The most likely is that we have a bad understanding of how old space is.
*  Technologies that shouldn't exist keep being discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope.
*  A bright red speck appears against the backdrop of a space photo, but astronomers say that
*  it shouldn't be there.
*  But there it is.
*  Published today in the journal Nature, an international research team led by Carl Glazenbrook
*  from Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne says that the light reaching Earth
*  from this galaxy named JWST 7329 is 11.5 billion years old and comes from an ancient
*  assembly of stars likely formed 13 billion years ago.
*  It doesn't make sense because it's been thought until now there wasn't enough dark matter
*  in the early universe to prompt this formation.
*  Current understandings of what grows a galaxy suggest that dark matter halos which are filled
*  or fields of invisible material in space coalesce and collect stars and galaxies within their
*  structure.
*  It's only because of the James Webb Space Telescope that the team has been able to clarify
*  what the red speck was in seven years of long observations using ground-based Keck, the
*  Hawaii Observatory and the VLT in Chile.
*  All they could see was a faint red smudge.
*  NASA's James Webb Telescope, it's been such an incredible thing, been waiting for the
*  last 30 years, been delivering all those dreams we've had, Glazenbrook tells Cosmos this
*  is something we've been working on over the years.
*  Deeper and deeper surveys looking for the oldest and most massive galaxies that formed.
*  We did the calculations of how old it is and it's way beyond the bounds of what's reasonable
*  to form in the cold dark matter dominated universe.
*  It's really a huge puzzle.
*  So I think they have crude instruments, relatively crude instruments for seeing that far back
*  and they keep getting better.
*  The James Webb is better than the Hubble and the more they can see, the more it reveals
*  puzzles.
*  They're just not exactly sure what the fuck is going on out there.
*  And it's big!
*  And when they find out, dude, doesn't that make you wonder?
*  Like, what the fuck, what's the answer?
*  Well they also don't even know if the Big Bang was actually the beginning of the universe.
*  There's a lot of people, including Sir Roger Penrose, think the Big Bang, that the universe
*  existed before the Big Bang.
*  And that there's also people that believe that there might be this constant cycle of
*  Big Bang expansion and then ultimately compression and then Big Bang again.
*  Which is really wild.
*  But that makes sense because it's like, how is there nothing?
*  How is there just nothing and then all of a sudden?
*  A Big Bang.
*  Yeah, it'd be more likely like everything expands, contracts.
*  But isn't it a weird thing to think how is there something?
*  If there wasn't nothing, why is there something?
*  Why has there always been something?
*  That seems even less likely.
*  What the fuck is that?
*  Right, but we gotta assume if there's something now, probably always stuff was something.
*  But how could it always be something?
*  How did it start?
*  That's the freaking, yeah, that's the question.
*  If you ever got to meet God, you'd be like, what predated you?
*  What created you?
*  And then your mind blows up.
*  And he'd be like, chat GBJ.
*  And then you'd be like, I am a fucking cyborg.
*  I think we're gonna find out some very interesting stuff in the next five years.
*  I think in the next five years, things are gonna get real fucking squirreling.
*  But there's no other choice than to look forward to it.
*  Well, I mean, no one's gonna hit the brakes.
*  We gotta ride this out and enjoy it.
*  So you just gotta think, well, we live in interesting times.
*  We definitely live in interesting times.
*  I think the most interesting times.
*  Because there was an interview recently where someone was talking about this and he was
*  saying that this is the first time in history that no one has any idea what it's gonna look
*  like in 20 years.
*  We're probably even five.
*  Probably even five.
*  Yeah.
*  Because the way everything's expanding exponentially kind of leads you to believe it's gonna continue
*  to do that.
*  And then what are those unpredictable changes gonna be?
*  My fucking life is completely different than it was five years ago, bro.
*  Unpredictable shit happened to me.
*  But I don't know.
*  Well, the whole world's different than it was four years ago.
*  Right?
*  COVID comes along, everything changes.
*  The whole world's different now.
*  So yeah, what does that look like?
*  What does it look like five, 20 years from now?
*  It's gonna be weird, man.
*  I'll tell you that.
*  There's no way it's not gonna be weird.
*  It's weird already.
*  Yeah, it is.
*  But it's almost like, do you live your life fucking worrying about it?
*  Or do you just say, I'm alive.
*  Just fucking check it out.
*  This is gonna be wild, dude.
*  We don't know.
*  Because when those solar flares could take everything out and then we don't even have
*  a show to watch.
*  True.
*  At least it's something to do.
*  Well, it's definitely something to do and you definitely can't stop it.
*  So you definitely should just live your life and enjoy it.
*  But it doesn't make it any less fascinating.
*  It is absolutely fascinating.
*  This is the timeline that we're in for whatever reason.
*  That's what gets real weird.
*  It's like, why are we in this timeline?
*  Everyone listening to this right now, everyone watching this right now, why are you in this
*  timeline?
*  Why is this the time that you exist?
*  Have you existed before?
*  Is this your first time in this timeline?
*  You know, everybody wants to assume it is like someone said to me once that they wouldn't
*  like there's this, there's this theory, I'm sure you're aware of this theory that you
*  live the same life over and over and over again until you get it right.
*  You know, that enlightenment is possible.
*  But you, you have to, you, you got to go at it over and over and over and over and over
*  again until you nail it.
*  And I was talking with a friend of mine, like, fuck, I wouldn't want to do that.
*  I'm like, OK, if you wouldn't want to do that, do you like life now?
*  Because I love life now.
*  I'm having a great time.
*  So someone said to me that I have to do this all over again.
*  Why would that be so bad?
*  Why am I scared of that?
*  But everybody's scared of that.
*  Everybody's scared of starting from scratch again, being a baby again.
*  But remember when you were a white belt?
*  Sure.
*  It was fucking awesome.
*  Not really.
*  Well, no, I'm not talking about just getting smashed and choked.
*  I'm talking about looking forward to learning.
*  Sure.
*  And maybe I should have said blue belt.
*  But it's like I got smashed a lot as a blue belt.
*  I like looking forward to this big journey.
*  You know what I mean?
*  Like when I when I first started doing kung fu when I was like 19 or 20, I didn't know
*  it and we didn't have to get choked.
*  So it was just fun.
*  Right.
*  You know, and I was like, oh, I don't know anything about this, but I have so much to
*  learn.
*  It's going to be so cool.
*  And then after years and years, I'm kind of jaded.
*  I've done it so fucking long.
*  I don't think I really even appreciate it anymore.
*  I know what you're saying.
*  Yeah, there's there's a thing that you can get jaded by a thing.
*  Yeah.
*  And new things are all very exciting.
*  That's why it's really important for people.
*  It's just for you, the health of your mind to try new things or to try things where you're
*  not that good at, try to keep getting better, because it's like this thing that you have
*  to do to practice and learn.
*  It enriches the way you think about everything.
*  Yeah.
*  It's so valuable to be able to do that and to be able to to realize you're doing that
*  and you're capable of learning new things.
*  And that really is what makes you live is, dude.
*  And that is why people get stagnant, because it's like when you were a kid, you were always
*  trying to learn something new.
*  You weren't like, oh, fuck, I'm jaded.
*  I just, man, I don't know what I'm going to do.
*  You were trying to learn constantly.
*  And so if you continue to do that, learn and play and just accept and have fun, you don't
*  have to get old.
*  You don't have to get stale.
*  You don't have to get bored.
*  You can fucking enjoy this life.
*  You can.
*  You certainly can if you find things that are exciting.
*  That's the saddest thing, I think, is someone who doesn't have a thing, someone who
*  doesn't have a thing that excites them, someone that doesn't doesn't engage with
*  something that stimulates them.
*  I think you need it as a human organism.
*  The human organism needs little puzzles and stuff to do makes it exciting for it.
*  If you don't do that, like you're going to feel shitty.
*  Yeah, you do.
*  You get bored.
*  I mean, God, the best, most happy times in your life are when you have all these
*  exciting projects, you don't know if it's even going to work.
*  But like, holy shit, I'm going to try.
*  I'm going to get excited about this and fucking go after it.
*  Hey, let me ask you this about your work, because I always wanted to ask you this
*  question. When you're painting Crazy Horse, is there any part of you that doesn't want
*  to do that?
*  Because it's like Crazy Horse did not want to be photographed.
*  So you have to paint what you imagine Crazy Horse would be.
*  It's kind of crazy that that dude got so, you know, no pun intended, got so famous
*  and managed to avoid having his picture taken.
*  I think he knew there are mugshots.
*  I think when I when I look back at all those the photographs, I think they were
*  fucking he wasn't he was a smart dude.
*  He didn't want his picture out there so he couldn't be identified because they're
*  trying to kill him.
*  They're definitely trying to kill him.
*  I think like, you know, I definitely do a lot of spiritual work, do spiritual work.
*  But no, like spiritual introspection.
*  And, you know, I like I have friends from the Oglala tribe who are like related to
*  him that I talk to and learn stories from the Lakota, the Oglala themselves.
*  So I try to have a deep insight for it.
*  Do a lot of research what he really would have looked like.
*  And also just think is this is this the right thing to do?
*  Do I have permission to do this?
*  And if that kind of comes through and the Lakota's themselves, they don't get a
*  hold of me and I problem and I talk to them about it, then it's OK.
*  But it's it's like.
*  It's not from an actual photograph.
*  Of course, it's just right from your mind.
*  Yeah. Well, not even that.
*  I try to like I think about.
*  Black Elks description of them and just try to put together the facial features of my
*  mind. How did they deal with that sculpture, that giant sculpture of Crazy Horse, the
*  one that hasn't been finished yet?
*  I don't know, but I don't really.
*  I like the idea of what they're doing, but it doesn't look that much to me like how I
*  imagine looking.
*  It's weird. You know, how do you how do you do a giant sculpture of a guy and say,
*  it's this guy? Yeah.
*  You don't even know what that guy looked like.
*  I know. How do you do?
*  But I think I think they're doing that to kind of just pay tribute to him.
*  Seems like a weird thing to do, though.
*  Yeah. You know, well, because I from I don't think I don't know.
*  I don't want to talk. It's like one family that's doing this, right?
*  Yeah. And I want to talk shit on this project.
*  What is that image of him?
*  Scroll up or you above that right there, right there.
*  Click on that. What is that?
*  That's a bronze statue or something.
*  That's supposed to be crazy horse.
*  Random stuff. Yeah.
*  But he didn't he like cut pieces off of his body like before he went to war,
*  cut like a hundred pieces off of his skin.
*  Sitting Bull.
*  Sitting Bull. Yeah. Didn't crazy horse do that as well?
*  No. Crazy horse didn't participate in a lot like the Sundance where you pierce.
*  No, no, no. I mean, he cut like pieces of his skin off, like marked his skin.
*  No, he that was sitting bull.
*  See if there's a story about crazy horse before we go to battle, cutting pieces of
*  his skin off, because I thought I thought they said that crazy horse did it as well.
*  That he had like like cut little pieces of himself off of his arms.
*  They had little scars all over his arms.
*  I hadn't heard that, but I heard Sitting Bull before the Battle of Little Big Horn,
*  before the Battle of Little Big Horn, Sitting Bull cut like a hundred pieces off
*  his shoulders and his back.
*  Maybe that's what I'm remembering.
*  And all that to get a vision of what the battle was going to be like.
*  And then he stared into the sun and he saw all these soldiers falling into the camp.
*  And so that's where, because Sitting Bull was kind of like the.
*  The general, he was a little older at the time of the battle and he had a bad wound
*  on his leg, but he was a visionary, really respected medicine man leader and crazy
*  horse was the actual fighter.
*  So he'd go and kind of lead the troops and do the actual fighting.
*  Did you find anything about crazy horse cutting pieces of his skin off?
*  So maybe I'm fucking it up.
*  But the, the thing that gets me is that they had these methods.
*  I mean, these are people that are living in a time where you had to be pragmatic.
*  You couldn't, you couldn't pretend that you could see things if you did a certain
*  thing, you were trying to achieve a vision.
*  So they had probably done it before and they had methods to do it.
*  And a lot of their methods involve pain, you know, like the thing where they would
*  pierce their nipples and suspend them.
*  Yeah.
*  Sundance crazy shit, man.
*  Yeah.
*  They did these things in a time where, you know, you're living a subsistence
*  lifestyle, you don't have a lot of time for fucking around for nonsense.
*  And yet they found value in like self torture.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, it's, I mean, it kind of, do you have any paintings on the Sundance?
*  No, I was, I was working on a painting of a Sundancer that has the white sage.
*  They would put white sage around their head like this, kind of like a halo and
*  then a where Eaglebone whistle here.
*  Yeah.
*  And they'd paint themselves white with the spots there.
*  And you're suspended.
*  Yeah.
*  Hanging by your nipples.
*  And you have to not eat for four days, not drink water.
*  And everybody around the village like gets to tease you and throw a little
*  spear twigs at your legs and shit.
*  And just like, it's an endurance ritual.
*  And eventually it rips out of your chest.
*  Yup.
*  Once it rips out and like, dude, friends of mine from South Dakota, they still
*  have those, those scars like this.
*  Bro.
*  Yeah.
*  Did you ever see a male cold horse?
*  I met a fuck yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I own that.
*  I got that on DVD.
*  That was, what was that gentleman's name?
*  Richard Harris.
*  That's right.
*  Yeah.
*  He goes through that ritual.
*  Yeah.
*  There's always that story though about that's why people get angry.
*  There's a story about the white guy who goes and kicks ass with the Indians.
*  Everyone's like, shut the fuck up.
*  Yeah.
*  Cause it like doesn't give the Indians enough credit.
*  Right.
*  In a way.
*  Right.
*  That one you can see has a little bit of the white savior thing to it.
*  Sure.
*  But it's not, it's not like they're not giving you something there.
*  That's what I think is that the native culture has taught me so much.
*  That's why I paint it.
*  That's why I got into that as a kid, because it was an alternative to mind
*  prison of the system of the schools.
*  I could see in the people's eyes that they were free, that they were real,
*  that they were powerful individuals.
*  And I wanted to follow that.
*  I didn't want to listen to like my second grade teacher who is, you know,
*  nothing I ever want to be like.
*  Right.
*  So I'd those books and I still have those books, you know, that's what inspired me
*  to do this and that's what keeps me going and sharing it with the world.
*  Because I want to say this is a valuable, amazing culture that we blindly destroyed
*  and committed a genocide on.
*  There are millions of people over here and the whites came over and were just so
*  fucking dumb that they just, they wasted a lot of good knowledge, but there's
*  still pieces of it alive and maybe we could do what we can to pay that back.
*  Learn from it.
*  My, yeah, my fear is that if it wasn't for the ability to use media in the
*  20th and 21st century, we might've lost the true story forever.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, you have a imagine if we did, you know, because the world wasn't much
*  different in terms of our technological capabilities from like 1500 to 1700.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  But from 1800 to the year 2000, it's a giant fucking difference.
*  And that's when people started going, Hey, what happened?
*  What fucking happened?
*  We should write books, like real books.
*  Yeah.
*  We should fucking really research this.
*  Like perspective.
*  Yeah.
*  I remember the first time I read Empire of the Summer Moon, which is about this
*  place right here, right where we're at.
*  I was like, Jesus, like how could we, how did I not know this?
*  Yeah.
*  How did, how does this not taught in school?
*  Like what happened?
*  Cause it's a fascinating story.
*  I know.
*  And you do really, really have to wonder that.
*  Why is that left out when it's one of our best stories?
*  Like I was talking to some of these guys out here earlier about, you know, why is
*  Quana's story just not as popular as like Custer and Crazy Horse and that?
*  Right.
*  Quana Parker.
*  Yeah.
*  And I think it's, it's because it's more complex.
*  It's not as easy as like the one guy from the one culture, the one battle,
*  Custer, Crazy Horse fight.
*  Right.
*  Done.
*  It's more of like, it's all over.
*  There's Jack Hayes.
*  There's, you know, Quana Parker.
*  There's the formation of the Texas Rangers.
*  There's a technology of the cult.
*  And there's another example of Cynthia Ann Parker.
*  Another example of someone who was kidnapped at a young age, became a
*  command ship and then they rescued her and she's like, I don't want to be rescued.
*  Yeah.
*  I want to go back.
*  Trying to escape.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a, what a time, man.
*  And it's so sad how she, like how she died thinking that Quana was dead and he wasn't.
*  Yeah.
*  And just how much he like wanted to honor her memory and how much, you know, he
*  loved his mom and he like what a good dude he was, like just such a bad ass warrior.
*  And then he was also a diplomat and took care of everyone and built that star house.
*  You know?
*  Also kind of crazy that he killed all that shitload of white people.
*  Yeah.
*  And still managed to like meet the president, hang out with everybody.
*  But people like forgave shit back then.
*  They're like, yeah, let's let that go.
*  That's the time we live in.
*  Everybody was murdering everybody back then.
*  That's what was really wild.
*  It's like just human life back then was worth so much less.
*  Yeah.
*  People were so much more savage.
*  Dude, the story of just Texas and the fucking Comanches is so wild and it's so
*  unappreciated and I like, I really think that with, with our country and our culture,
*  we really do have a cool history that was so unique where, you know what I mean?
*  Nothing like that really ever happened.
*  And like, to your point, we had a way to keep records of it, but there's dude,
*  there's all these rad stories about native history.
*  Like there's this dude, William Weatherby.
*  If you can look up the story of William Weatherby, the Creek warrior, Red Eagle.
*  He, he led this big rebellion of the Creek Indians and the government hired
*  Andrew Jackson, who was later president, I think to go fight him.
*  He's this big civil war general and these Creeks would build these big fortifications
*  and try to fight off the, the army and they blow it apart with cannons and just
*  slaughtered like, you know, hundreds of Creeks fought this big protracted war
*  with them, like in Alabama.
*  No one even knows about the fucking Creek war or who William Weatherby is.
*  But when you hear his story, dude, he's like William Wallace of America.
*  You wouldn't believe this motherfucker.
*  Okay.
*  His whole village is getting wiped out in there and he's the leader and they're
*  like, where's William, I was going to say Wallace, where's William Weatherby?
*  Weatherford?
*  Is it, is it Weatherford?
*  Why?
*  I couldn't find a Weatherby, but I got a Weatherford.
*  I got it wrong.
*  Weatherby's a rifle.
*  Yeah.
*  Okay.
*  Weatherford.
*  So anyway, he's this Creek warrior and he's like the leader and he's, he's
*  getting tracked down and they're trying to find him and they're, they're like,
*  basically it's kind of like the Braveheart, how they're like,
*  Why does he have an American name?
*  I mean, back then they were interacting a lot with the English and it wasn't
*  uncommon for a native to have a white name.
*  I think it was half white, half Indian too, but he was such a bad ass dude.
*  So they're, they're basically like saying, if you don't, if red eagle,
*  that's his Indian name doesn't come in, we're going to just really devastate
*  these people.
*  We're going to, you know, all your people are going to be having a bad time.
*  So they were like, basically going to hurt his tribe if he doesn't surrender.
*  Okay.
*  And so he's riding in to surrender and he sees a deer, fucking shoots it,
*  picks it up, guts it, throws it over a saddle and keeps riding in to go
*  surrender.
*  Right.
*  And he gets there to Andrew Jackson and he's like, if I had an army, I'd
*  fight you to the death, but you've killed all my warriors and I only have women
*  and children and I'm not going to let them suffer so you can chase me.
*  So here I am fucking kill me if you want to do whatever.
*  And what'd they do to him?
*  Well, Andrew Jackson actually said, this dude's so brave.
*  Let's have a drink.
*  And they went in the tent, drink some whiskey.
*  And as they're in the tent, everybody's chanting, all the soldiers are chanting.
*  See, there he is.
*  Kill him, kill him, kill him.
*  That's the soldiers big chance all around from the army.
*  Kill him, kill him, kill him.
*  Jackson walks out.
*  Everyone's quiet.
*  Let me tell you, Red Eagle is the bravest motherfucker of all of y'all.
*  And if anybody touches a hair on his head, you're going to answer to me.
*  Don't fuck with Red Eagle and let some go.
*  Imagine being a fly on the wall during that meeting.
*  Yeah.
*  See that guy come in and sit down.
*  Yeah.
*  But just the bravest, if you read the story and he gives this incredible
*  speech, like I didn't really do it justice, but he's just very eloquent.
*  You know, says this shit is like, do what you want with me.
*  Don't fuck with my people.
*  I don't.
*  The history of Native Americans is there's so many people don't know what happened.
*  So many people that don't know that Native Americans went to Paris and met with
*  whoever the hell was in charge back then.
*  Yeah.
*  Crazy shit.
*  Dude, the actual like truth is stranger than fiction.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, cause we, we like the people writing fucking movies are going to go,
*  I don't want to try that fucking hard cowboy Indian.
*  Right.
*  Can't put in the can.
*  Whatever they say.
*  I wonder if someone's going to do like a real realistic movie about the
*  Comanche and the Texas Rangers.
*  The dude, the Yellowstone dude doing the empire of a summer moon.
*  That's right.
*  Is he doing that?
*  Is that official?
*  Ooh, that's going to be wild.
*  He'll do it right.
*  Taylor Sheridan knows what the fuck he's doing.
*  He'll do it right.
*  If anybody should be entrusted with that.
*  Did you see 1883?
*  Oh yeah.
*  Amazing.
*  Right.
*  Amazing.
*  I mean, yeah.
*  And how like the Lakota is how they put the, the feces on the air to poison them.
*  Yellowstone, Taylor Sheridan lands empire of the summer moon will write and direct
*  epic Comanche leader Kwanah and the rise and fall of old West fiercest tribe.
*  January 18th, 2024.
*  Fuck.
*  Yeah.
*  He's going to nail it.
*  What's that going to be like?
*  It's going to be incredible.
*  I hope that the Westerns come back as a genre.
*  Cause I really think we should take pride in our history more.
*  You know what I mean?
*  I think it would bond us more as just like we're Americans or our, uh, like
*  ancestors, they fucking went across the sea.
*  They went across the continent.
*  They fucked with the command.
*  Jeez.
*  Like they were brave.
*  They're crazy.
*  That's who our ancestors are.
*  They should be honored, dude.
*  We should be thinking about them going, we're Americans.
*  We're bad ass.
*  We won the fucking world war two.
*  We, the, you know,
*  someone's had a couple of lone stars.
*  Look at you.
*  God damn it.
*  We're fucking Americans.
*  Well, you know what I mean?
*  We fucking did it, bro.
*  Like the, this is the history, dude.
*  It's a fascinating history.
*  Yeah.
*  It's certainly a fascinating history and it's just riddled with horror
*  stories, horror stories and amazing accomplishments and brave people and
*  all of it mixing together.
*  Yeah.
*  Crazy stuff.
*  Yeah.
*  And listen, brother, no one captures it better.
*  No one captures the native American imagery and just the feeling of it
*  better than you.
*  Your stuff's awesome, man.
*  And so it's been dope getting to become friends with you.
*  Yeah.
*  Same here, dude.

*  me get my art out there to the world.
