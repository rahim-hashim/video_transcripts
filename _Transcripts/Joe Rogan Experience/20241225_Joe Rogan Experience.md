# Joe Rogan Experience #2247 - Duncan Trussell
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [December 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day! [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6.0s)]
*  Oh shit, I didn't know we had bells. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=10.0s)]
*  Yeah bro, we got bells. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=15.0s)]
*  It's probably super annoying to people listening. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=17.0s)]
*  It's fucking Christmas. The war on Christmas must end. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=19.0s)]
*  How dare we say Merry Christmas? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=24.0s)]
*  How dare you say that? It offends me! [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=26.0s)]
*  Did you ever see Kamala Harris do that? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=29.0s)]
*  When she had the speech? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=31.0s)]
*  She said how dare you say fucking Christmas? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=33.0s)]
*  You've never seen it? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=34.0s)]
*  No. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=35.0s)]
*  Oh my god. Okay, let's start with this. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=36.0s)]
*  Because it's so crazy. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=37.0s)]
*  I don't understand the context. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=39.0s)]
*  So like, I wish I could be charitable. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=41.0s)]
*  And say, well there's probably a context where this makes sense. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=45.0s)]
*  Yeah, Satan is the lord of the earth is the context. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=48.0s)]
*  But you know you see something and it's only a 15 second clip and you go like, okay. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=51.0s)]
*  Let me just be the nicest person possible. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=56.0s)]
*  Like what could be the reason why you would say, how dare we say Merry Christmas? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=58.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=62.0s)]
*  Unless you're playing a character. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=63.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=64.0s)]
*  Unless she's on stage doing a play. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=65.0s)]
*  She's like, I want to read from my college play. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=67.0s)]
*  Or I was the Grinch. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=69.0s)]
*  Can you imagine saying that? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=71.0s)]
*  Like it seems like a nightmare that you would wake up from. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=73.0s)]
*  It says Harris fumed at Americans saying Merry Christmas before illegal migrants were protected in resurfaced clips. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=76.0s)]
*  Oh, you're not allowed to say it until there's absolute peace and harmony on the planet. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=84.0s)]
*  Then we could start saying it again. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=87.0s)]
*  This is so scolding and weird. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=89.0s)]
*  Only when they cleared that vet did we give them DACA status. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=91.0s)]
*  And now we're talking about taking it away. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=95.0s)]
*  It is morally wrong. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=98.0s)]
*  No, thank you. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=101.0s)]
*  I didn't know. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=102.0s)]
*  And when we all sing happy tunes and sing Merry Christmas and wish each other Merry Christmas. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=103.0s)]
*  These children are not going to have a Merry Christmas. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=109.0s)]
*  How dare we speak Merry Christmas? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=112.0s)]
*  How dare we? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=116.0s)]
*  They will not have a Merry Christmas. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=119.0s)]
*  Who are you to say that? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=121.0s)]
*  We don't know if they will be here in a matter of days, weeks and months. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=122.0s)]
*  Since September 5th, over 12,000 have lost their status. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=127.0s)]
*  This is the here's why you can't be charitable, because it's just a bad perspective. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=134.0s)]
*  It's just a bad perspective. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=141.0s)]
*  Charitable? What do you mean? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=143.0s)]
*  Because if you wanted to like, what does she say? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=144.0s)]
*  Does anything she's saying make sense? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=147.0s)]
*  They're not mutually exclusive. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=149.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=152.0s)]
*  You can't. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=153.0s)]
*  It's like celebrating joy and happiness and some people suffering. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=154.0s)]
*  It's like you can't. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=159.0s)]
*  You can't say no one is going to suffer anywhere before I celebrate. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=160.0s)]
*  No, because that's crazy. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=166.0s)]
*  Now you're taking in the entire Earth's consciousness and all of its decisions [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=169.0s)]
*  as to whether or not you will or will not be happy. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=174.0s)]
*  Like you and I didn't force anybody to work in the cobalt mines. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=178.0s)]
*  Not yet. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=182.0s)]
*  We buy these fucking phones. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=183.0s)]
*  We buy these fucking phones and we know, we know that electronics that have cobalt in them [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=184.0s)]
*  were probably pulled out of the ground by slaves. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=191.0s)]
*  Should we never celebrate anything again until those people are free? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=193.0s)]
*  No, never. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=198.0s)]
*  Never? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=199.0s)]
*  We should just be shitting in our hands, rubbing in our faces, whipping our backs [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=200.0s)]
*  until the whole world experiences a simultaneous orgasm. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=204.0s)]
*  Then, Merry Christmas to you. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=208.0s)]
*  But if you were a drone, so let's just say they really are intergalactic beings [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=210.0s)]
*  and you're watching all of our hypocrisy and our scolding of each other [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=214.0s)]
*  and these like untested perspectives just jizzed out into the world [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=220.0s)]
*  and you're looking at all this craziness, like the manufacturing of almost everything that we have [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=226.0s)]
*  that comes from overseas is probably from horrible conditions. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=234.0s)]
*  We've just accepted that. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=239.0s)]
*  Like if aliens were watching this, they'd be like, who are they bullshitting? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=241.0s)]
*  Who are they bullshitting each other? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=245.0s)]
*  Are they bullshitting themselves? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=247.0s)]
*  They're trying to figure out how many genders there are. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=248.0s)]
*  They're trying to decide who's the most protective status who you can't discuss about anything. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=250.0s)]
*  Currently, that's illegal immigrants. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=257.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, you know, I was just, dude, I don't know why I started doing this. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=260.0s)]
*  Highly recommend it. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=265.0s)]
*  I started listening because I forgot a lot of the New Age ideas. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=267.0s)]
*  So I started listening to New Age-channeled audibles, aliens channeled through New Age people. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=271.0s)]
*  Oh, cheers, my brother. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=279.0s)]
*  Cheers! Merry Christmas! [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=281.0s)]
*  We're off to a great start. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=283.0s)]
*  Isn't that Seth Speaks? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=285.0s)]
*  It's a whole genre. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=288.0s)]
*  But is that Seth Speaks person? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=290.0s)]
*  That's the whole deal behind that, right? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=292.0s)]
*  Okay, so it's, again, I'm like, my mom got into it briefly because she dated this New Age dude [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=294.0s)]
*  and I fucking hated it. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=300.0s)]
*  He wore Birkenstocks, he'd force us to go on hikes. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=302.0s)]
*  He wouldn't let me take my fake gun. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=304.0s)]
*  You know, you're a kid, you want to take your fake gun on the hike? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=306.0s)]
*  He's like, we don't do that on hikes. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=309.0s)]
*  The fucking fascist hike where you're forced to recognize the beauty of nature. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=311.0s)]
*  And it's like, dude, don't put that on me. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=317.0s)]
*  I'll find it on my own. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=319.0s)]
*  But he got my mom into New Age stuff. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=321.0s)]
*  And this was prime New Age time. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=324.0s)]
*  This is like, this is when they all killed themselves. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=327.0s)]
*  It's like they were part of it, too. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=330.0s)]
*  They were wearing the sneakers, what were they called? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=332.0s)]
*  Heaven's Gate. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=335.0s)]
*  That was a New Age cult. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=337.0s)]
*  So I remember watching these old grainy VHS tapes with my mom and this dude [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=339.0s)]
*  and thinking they were cool. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=345.0s)]
*  There was some sound that was playing in one and my mom looks at me like, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=349.0s)]
*  hopefully, do you recognize that sound? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=353.0s)]
*  Because I guess... [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=355.0s)]
*  Here's the thing about all this. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=361.0s)]
*  I think some telepathy is real. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=363.0s)]
*  It is real. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=367.0s)]
*  I think it is real. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=368.0s)]
*  Have you listened to the telepathy tapes? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=369.0s)]
*  No. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=371.0s)]
*  You haven't? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=372.0s)]
*  I haven't listened to it. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=373.0s)]
*  It's a new podcast. It's out. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=374.0s)]
*  And it's all about this scientific research that was done with nonverbal autistic kids [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=376.0s)]
*  and their parents. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=382.0s)]
*  And they were able to go into another room and they would bring up things to one, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=384.0s)]
*  whether it was... I think they would bring things up to the mom or the mom would say things. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=391.0s)]
*  The kid was accurate 95% of the time. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=395.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=399.0s)]
*  With numbers, with colors, like three numbers in a row. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=400.0s)]
*  You know how crazy that is? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=406.0s)]
*  Just to guess three numbers in a row 95% of the time? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=408.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=410.0s)]
*  Like whatever it is, they think it's real. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=411.0s)]
*  I'm only on episode two. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=413.0s)]
*  But it's really fascinating, man, because it's a dismissed thing. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=415.0s)]
*  It's a woo woo thing. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=420.0s)]
*  But if it's real, shouldn't scientists study it like it's real? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=422.0s)]
*  And it seems like through scientific study, it's real. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=426.0s)]
*  Yeah. I think it's definitely... You've probably experienced it. I've experienced it. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=429.0s)]
*  I think it's an emerging part of human consciousness that we don't agree to or we don't admit to. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=433.0s)]
*  Like we know there's something there, but we're not like, that's too silly. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=441.0s)]
*  It's just there's so many people that fake it. That's the problem. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=445.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=449.0s)]
*  Because everybody wants to have some special thing that they have. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=450.0s)]
*  You just have a special thing. You have a special thing, Duncan. You have a special talent. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=456.0s)]
*  I mean, think of all... Firestarter, Carrie, Stranger Things. This is the fantasy. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=460.0s)]
*  When I was a kid, dude, I would sit when my dad was working in his apartment and try to make shit on the table move with my mind. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=466.0s)]
*  Because I've been reading books on telekinesis. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=473.0s)]
*  One day, you know when you've got a cold drink and it gets a little wet on the bottom? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=476.0s)]
*  One day as I'm doing that, because of that it slid forward. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=485.0s)]
*  And I was totally freaked out because I thought I'd use telekinesis to slide. It was just luck. It was just luck. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=489.0s)]
*  It was just a badly balanced floor. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=498.0s)]
*  It was just a shitty fucking apartment in College Station. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=500.0s)]
*  But once you recognize the flaw in the operating system in humans, as a kid, for a few days I was like, shit, I might be telekinetic. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=504.0s)]
*  But once you know people want that or want to believe in it and how easy it is to manufacture those moments and then claim responsibility, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=516.0s)]
*  holy shit, dude, you can really pull some strings on people because there's an assumption. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=524.0s)]
*  I really believe in telepathy. I'm positive it exists. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=530.0s)]
*  But the assumption then would be like you get around a telepathic person. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=535.0s)]
*  Well, they must be good because they're telepathic, right? They have magic. So we should trust them. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=539.0s)]
*  This is where people get real fucked up. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=545.0s)]
*  These are called, in India they call them cities, which is if you meditate a lot, you begin to like, well, I would say comedy is a city. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=548.0s)]
*  It's not special. I was talking to Luis Gomez about sales. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=557.0s)]
*  That's the really good people who can get in your head and get you to buy shit. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=562.0s)]
*  He was saying it's basically magic. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=567.0s)]
*  Hypnosis. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=569.0s)]
*  Hypnosis, yeah. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=571.0s)]
*  Have you ever been hypnotized? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=573.0s)]
*  Yes, I have. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=575.0s)]
*  It's interesting, right? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=576.0s)]
*  Dude, my mom hypnotized me when I had a wart because she had heard you could hypnotize people and the wart goes away. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=577.0s)]
*  Hypnotized me, said something about the wart going away. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=584.0s)]
*  Within a couple of weeks, I swear to you, that wart fucking dried up and just fell off my hand. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=588.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=594.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=595.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=596.0s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=597.0s)]
*  Whoa. What the fuck? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=598.0s)]
*  So that's the placebo effect. The placebo effect is real. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=600.0s)]
*  You know, I had a guy tell me this once. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=604.0s)]
*  He was like a kind of a wacky healing chiropractic type guy. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=606.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=611.0s)]
*  He was telling me that if you believe what I'm saying is true, because I was asking him, like, how does this work? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=612.0s)]
*  How is this working? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=618.0s)]
*  How are you healing people by working on, like, pressing on things? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=619.0s)]
*  If you believe it works. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=623.0s)]
*  So it's a lie. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=625.0s)]
*  But if I believe the lie, so what are you selling? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=626.0s)]
*  You're just fucking manipulating people and saying mumbo jumbo muscular structural words. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=631.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=638.0s)]
*  And you're doing hypnosis, kind of, because you're sort of admitting that by healing, like a person who's going to heal you with words and talking and touching you, they're tricking you into doing it yourself. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=639.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, the placebo effect is real. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=652.0s)]
*  I've heard it's one of the most powerful effects in medicine. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=655.0s)]
*  Is it really? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=659.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, yeah. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=660.0s)]
*  Think of, like, the new cancer drugs. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=661.0s)]
*  They tell your immune system what to attack, right? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=663.0s)]
*  So if somehow you could do that without the drug, and that's where it gets interesting, right? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=666.0s)]
*  Because we, these are our bodies. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=673.0s)]
*  Perfectly metabolizing, transforming so many things instantaneously, the heart effortlessly beating all the fucking time. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=677.0s)]
*  So theoretically, purely theoretically, what if you could control more of it? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=689.0s)]
*  Like, how much of this thing can we actually control? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=695.0s)]
*  And by the way, that's a really fun thing to think about because, like, not much. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=697.0s)]
*  So you ever think about that? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=704.0s)]
*  Like, you sort of think, like, OK, like, how much of my body can I really do anything about? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=706.0s)]
*  I can eat good food. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=712.0s)]
*  I can exercise. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=713.0s)]
*  But all the quantum processes that are happening within, all of the things, you kind of realize you're just the tip of the iceberg. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=714.0s)]
*  You're just the yappy tip of the iceberg. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=722.0s)]
*  And underneath it is all this stuff that is you, but really isn't you if having control of yourself is like a way to identify this as me. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=724.0s)]
*  So what are you in that swirl of particulates? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=734.0s)]
*  Like, what are you in there? [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=737.0s)]
*  Yeah, what are you? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=739.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=741.0s)]
*  That's most people. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=742.0s)]
*  And that's one of the reasons why ideologies are so interesting. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=743.0s)]
*  Because it's the same thing. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=748.0s)]
*  It's the same person. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=751.0s)]
*  It's just they've agreed to one thing or they agreed to the other thing. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=753.0s)]
*  And it could be how you were raised or it could be you rebelling or it could be. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=757.0s)]
*  But people find a way to fucking slip into a groove. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=761.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=765.0s)]
*  And it's so much easier than trying to look at like, what is this? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=766.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=771.0s)]
*  What is this thing we're doing? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=772.0s)]
*  Or I'm making noises with my mouth. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=773.0s)]
*  You're reading my mind. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=775.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=776.0s)]
*  And we're like broadcasting it to the world by making noises with your mouth. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=777.0s)]
*  We're speaking through each other's minds. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=781.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=783.0s)]
*  And also, though, you know, when you get into the telepathy idea, which is sort of like the question is like, you know, right now we identify our minds as some kind of neurological process. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=784.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=798.0s)]
*  So the idea is like we have this like bio computer and somewhere in there is our mind. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=799.0s)]
*  Everything out here, not our mind, even though everything out here from a neurological perspective is our mind. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=805.0s)]
*  Everything you're seeing is an instantaneous interpretation of a variety of phenomena that gets compressed into reality. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=813.0s)]
*  And then you say, oh, out there is that's not me. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=823.0s)]
*  But it is you. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=828.0s)]
*  It's like it's you in the way if you put on VR goggles, you know, except in this case, the VR goggles, it's your neocortex. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=829.0s)]
*  It's all the processes that are making color, light, sound, etc. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=836.0s)]
*  So if we're sort of sharing a dual reality, which is all the phenomena that's being interpreted into our minds, somewhere in there is the possibility that we kind of share a mind. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=839.0s)]
*  So from that perspective, all these other things become possible. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=850.0s)]
*  Telepathy, all of this stuff. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=855.0s)]
*  Like, you know, you get around funny people, you get funnier. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=858.0s)]
*  When I was doing the Midnight Gospel, I was around all these artists. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=861.0s)]
*  I got better at drawing. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=863.0s)]
*  Like you share a mind. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=865.0s)]
*  It's the gestalt or you know, the three or two or more of you gathered there will be that something else comes in the room. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=866.0s)]
*  I think we're collaborating with something that we're we don't truly understand because we're still trapped in primate bodies. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=874.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=882.0s)]
*  So I think I think we have these moments of recognition of these connections, you know, and in great moments in life and these beautiful things that can happen. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=883.0s)]
*  And it's all being twisted up by this ape, this wild ape that had to survive for thousands and thousands of years by killing its neighbors. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=894.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=906.0s)]
*  And eating monkeys and fucking running around and clubbing things to death and eating raw meat. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=907.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=913.0s)]
*  Until it figured out how to harness fire. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=914.0s)]
*  And then it had to deal with neighboring tribes coming in with hordes of people with swords and spears. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=916.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=922.0s)]
*  You had to run for the hills. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=923.0s)]
*  They killed your kids in front of you. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=924.0s)]
*  They fucked your wife in front of you. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=926.0s)]
*  They cut your dick off and stuffed it in your mouth. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=928.0s)]
*  And this was thousands and thousands of years. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=930.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=935.0s)]
*  This thing we're doing right now is so recent. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=936.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=939.0s)]
*  This thing where you can meet strangers, you don't have to worry about killing them. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=940.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=943.0s)]
*  Super recent. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=944.0s)]
*  Dogs aren't there yet. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=946.0s)]
*  That's why dogs freak out when someone comes to your door. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=947.0s)]
*  They're not there yet. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=949.0s)]
*  They still remember the old days. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=950.0s)]
*  And the that's a great point that they're still like, dude, usually if someone's coming up, we have to kill it. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=952.0s)]
*  Like they're reminding you of that. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=958.0s)]
*  You know, it's true. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=961.0s)]
*  I mean, but if you look at that collective epigenetic trauma as an egregore, as a ghost, a ghost haunting the planet, the ghost of like not that long ago. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=963.0s)]
*  Yeah, the ghost of primate past. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=976.0s)]
*  The ghost of primate past haunts us. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=978.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=980.0s)]
*  And that's why it's so easy to slide into aggressive patterns and defensive patterns that are completely unnecessary. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=981.0s)]
*  And that's what they are, too. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=990.0s)]
*  This is what you have to realize. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=992.0s)]
*  It's not you. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=993.0s)]
*  It's patterns that you've selected and you've you've selected them over and over and over again. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=994.0s)]
*  And they've become you. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=999.0s)]
*  It's like you went down a groove. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1001.0s)]
*  You don't have to stay on that groove. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1002.0s)]
*  No, you don't have to. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1004.0s)]
*  But I think you have to find something in life that's physical that you enjoy, because I think that's one of the best ways to manage this fucking weirdness. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1006.0s)]
*  The absolute best way is through getting physically exhausted. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1019.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1023.0s)]
*  Just get forget on purpose, get physically exhausted and then you can manage the craziness. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1024.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1030.0s)]
*  Of existing. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1031.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1032.0s)]
*  Because everybody wants to pretend that it's normal. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1033.0s)]
*  Everyone wants to pretend that existence is like, oh, you know, get up on the morning and fucking have your eggs and your bacon and you do your thing. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1035.0s)]
*  You know what Chappell-Roehan said? [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1041.0s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1043.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1045.0s)]
*  It's like every day it's like, oh, my God, this is happening. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1046.0s)]
*  What do you think the drones are? [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1049.0s)]
*  What do you think the drones are? [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1050.0s)]
*  You know, how much to dance your blows he make this week in the stock market? [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1052.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1055.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1056.0s)]
*  You might like, what? [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1057.0s)]
*  What is this? [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1058.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1059.0s)]
*  What are we doing? [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1060.0s)]
*  Did you see the new shit that they found out about consciousness in the human brain? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1062.0s)]
*  This popped up on my feed. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1067.0s)]
*  This dude Penrose, this guy used to be an anesthesiologist. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1069.0s)]
*  He already knew about these neurological structures that are these quantum tubules that apparently anesthesia impacts. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1072.0s)]
*  And he began to think maybe consciousness is not associated as much as we thought with neurons, but is a microstructure within the brain, these quantum tubules that get shut down when there's anesthesia. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1079.0s)]
*  And so there's this new controversial sort of emergent theory of consciousness, which is that when you are awake, you go from being a wave to a particle. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1095.0s)]
*  You, in other words, the whatever you want to call it, the I am the all one situation that we actually are experiencing gets compressed into a particle, which is your experience of reality. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1107.0s)]
*  But when you fall asleep and taking a facet, you go into a superposition when that's that feeling of being connected to everything, part of everything, not even being there anymore. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1121.0s)]
*  So we're those things simultaneously. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1131.0s)]
*  And I guess as far as the default reality that you're talking about, that's a situation where it's a bunch of particles that have focused in on like a buffet of moments that the news curates. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1133.0s)]
*  So the news is like, OK, be mad at this person. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1151.0s)]
*  This person's wrong. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1154.0s)]
*  This person's right. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1156.0s)]
*  Here's what you should be afraid of. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1157.0s)]
*  Here's a celebrity that sucks. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1159.0s)]
*  This sucks. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1160.0s)]
*  That's the whole business model. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1165.0s)]
*  Business model. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1167.0s)]
*  And that's the way we get the news. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1168.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1170.0s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? And sponsored by pharmaceutical drug companies. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1171.0s)]
*  There you go. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1174.0s)]
*  And everybody else. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1175.0s)]
*  I was watching a regular movie the other night. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1176.0s)]
*  I was in a hotel. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1180.0s)]
*  And so it was the only thing they had in the hotel was regular movies on TV. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1181.0s)]
*  TV. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1186.0s)]
*  I was watching John Wick on TV and it's every five minutes. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1187.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1192.0s)]
*  You're bombarded with nonsense. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1193.0s)]
*  They stop the show and give you five minutes of nonsense. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1196.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1201.0s)]
*  Just nonsense about the end side effects. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1202.0s)]
*  It's unnerving. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1205.0s)]
*  And also when you realize we think the show is John Wick, that ain't the show. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1206.0s)]
*  The show is the nonsense that's happening in between John Wick. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1211.0s)]
*  Because when you still go out when you're watching a good movie, you relax. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1214.0s)]
*  You calm down. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1219.0s)]
*  You open up. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1220.0s)]
*  It's the perfect, perfect state of consciousness to manipulate people. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1222.0s)]
*  I also thought it was incredible that they bleeped out all the bad words when the commercials were far more offensive. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1227.0s)]
*  They bleeped out fuck. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1238.0s)]
*  They bleeped out this. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1240.0s)]
*  I was like, how are they going to handle this scene? [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1241.0s)]
*  Because there's this scene where the Russian mobster, his son, comes home from this job in Atlantic City after he did this thing with John Wick. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1243.0s)]
*  And the guy's like, who the fuck? [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1253.0s)]
*  Nobody goes that fucking nobody is John Wick. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1255.0s)]
*  And it's like the whole setup of John Wick. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1259.0s)]
*  And it's that nobody. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1262.0s)]
*  Like, no, you're gross. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1264.0s)]
*  You can't say fuck. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1267.0s)]
*  You took out the fuck. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1268.0s)]
*  But meanwhile, you're telling me about a bloody diarrhea that might kill you. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1269.0s)]
*  You take this drug. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1273.0s)]
*  You're telling me about side effects that are like suicide, like all kinds of like wild shit, depression, anxiety, fear, violent tendencies, dude, gambling addictions. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1275.0s)]
*  This is so when you think about the idea that if you know what a group of witches is called a coven, a group of Christians is called a church. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1289.0s)]
*  The idea is sort of simultaneous prayer causes change. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1298.0s)]
*  Now, there's different words. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1303.0s)]
*  Some people call the prayer spells. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1304.0s)]
*  Some people call the prayer a pep rally. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1306.0s)]
*  We're going to go, go, go. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1308.0s)]
*  You look at the football game, you're seeing covens of witches cheering to direct energy at the team they want to try to like move the needle a little bit. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1310.0s)]
*  But when you consider the power of directing little bubble universes, which is every single human focusing that beam of attention onto certain ideas, dude, you could you're you're you're not only are you going to create whatever it is you want to create in the case of an advertiser makes some money, but theoretically you could guide history that way. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1320.0s)]
*  And the last thing you want them to figure out is if they all stop focusing on what you're telling them to focus on and trust themselves enough to focus on what they want to focus on, which is usually not bad, then all of a sudden you would lose that kind of magical control. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1345.0s)]
*  You lose the actual steering wheel of the of the weird vehicle. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1362.0s)]
*  You know, and we you know, they're like, it's democracy. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1367.0s)]
*  The steering wheel is your vote and the president and the elected officials who guide the country. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1370.0s)]
*  But the real steering wheel is here's what we're going to need to pay attention to. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1376.0s)]
*  You need to pay attention to this right now. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1380.0s)]
*  And if we all pay attention to that, it like where attention goes energy flows that you know what I think it is. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1382.0s)]
*  I think it's like if we're in a factory. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1389.0s)]
*  If we're in a factory and there's certain gears that turn certain machines and they think they're the only thing that exists. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1394.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1402.0s)]
*  But it's a chain of things that have to take place in order to manufacture something like a Tesla. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1403.0s)]
*  Yeah. Imagine if you are if if we just don't realize it. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1410.0s)]
*  But if everything has a consciousness, at least in some sort of a limited capacity. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1415.0s)]
*  Yeah. Literally everything, even tables. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1419.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1421.0s)]
*  Everything has some thing. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1422.0s)]
*  Yeah. Just we were super egotistic and we believe that only we possess this. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1424.0s)]
*  But we know dogs have it, too, which gets where it gets weird. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1428.0s)]
*  Yeah. Animals have it. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1431.0s)]
*  Yeah. We know that, you know, but this whole thing that we're doing is trying to understand how we interface. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1432.0s)]
*  Yeah. How are we doing this? [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1444.0s)]
*  It's like if we're in a world where it's 2024 and there's drones flying over New Jersey and they're gaslighting us saying they're all airplanes. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1446.0s)]
*  They're saying we have it under control. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1457.0s)]
*  Yeah. And then it appears there was a satellite that we shot out of the sky. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1459.0s)]
*  Yeah. Have you seen that? [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1463.0s)]
*  No. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1464.0s)]
*  No, you haven't seen that? [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1465.0s)]
*  I missed it. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1466.0s)]
*  So this is the big conspiracy. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1467.0s)]
*  And again, I have done no research. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1468.0s)]
*  So do not believe me, ladies and gentlemen. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1470.0s)]
*  OK, Alf. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1472.0s)]
*  The big conspiracy is that these are Chinese drones and they're being piloted by a satellite that they shot out of orbit. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1473.0s)]
*  And this is a conspiracy, unfounded conspiracy. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1482.0s)]
*  Unfounded. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1485.0s)]
*  But I'm just for funsies, for funsies. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1486.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, do you remember when those weird green fucking lights showed up in Hawaii? [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1488.0s)]
*  Well, I remember where there was a ship, right? [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1494.0s)]
*  And there was like these triangle looking things that were flying over a ship. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1497.0s)]
*  Those laser lights that shot out of the sky. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1500.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1502.0s)]
*  Remember that? [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1503.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1504.0s)]
*  What was that? [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1505.0s)]
*  What are the drones? [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1506.0s)]
*  I mean, that's what I love about the drones is, I mean, aside from the obvious, like, you know, getting to imagine, fantasize, it could be they're chasing orbs and the orbs or whatever. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1507.0s)]
*  What I love about the drones is that it's another step in shaking people awake. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1518.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1525.0s)]
*  Because it's like part of living in default reality, I think, is you sort of lean into the idea that the government is you could trust. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1526.0s)]
*  You can trust the government. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1537.0s)]
*  Of course. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1538.0s)]
*  Like you have to trust the people that make the weapons. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1539.0s)]
*  You could trust them. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1541.0s)]
*  They're really guys. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1542.0s)]
*  Good guys. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1543.0s)]
*  Sure. Yes. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1544.0s)]
*  Some of them, you know, are hyper violent. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1545.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1547.0s)]
*  But ultimately, we can trust these people. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1548.0s)]
*  And so then you have over fucking New Jersey experimental vehicles that people are filming. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1551.0s)]
*  Welcome to Earth, bitch. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1558.0s)]
*  Do you see that one? [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1559.0s)]
*  And it's so funny. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1560.0s)]
*  People in New Jersey reacting to them. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1562.0s)]
*  Did you see the guy shooting into the sky at the drone? [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1565.0s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1568.0s)]
*  I mean, I'm surprised more people haven't. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1569.0s)]
*  Well, the problem with that, you fucking idiots, is that bullets fall. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1571.0s)]
*  OK, and they fall with almost the same kind of velocity. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1575.0s)]
*  I mean, I'm sure they lose a lot of steam, but it's enough to kill people. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1578.0s)]
*  People definitely died from bullets falling from the sky. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1583.0s)]
*  You know what else falls? [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1585.0s)]
*  Drones. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1586.0s)]
*  Experimental fucking drones. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1587.0s)]
*  The government's flying over fucking New Jersey, hoping those fuckers don't crash. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1588.0s)]
*  They're apparently half the size of a car. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1593.0s)]
*  Some of them are bigger, bro. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1595.0s)]
*  Some of them are suburban size. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1596.0s)]
*  They're like SUV size. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1598.0s)]
*  And these are flying over houses. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1599.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1600.0s)]
*  So it's just like, no, listen, number one, most of what you guys are seeing, it's stars [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1601.0s)]
*  or you're seeing commercial vehicles mostly. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1606.0s)]
*  And the other stuff we don't really know. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1610.0s)]
*  So at that point, you're like, wait a minute. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1614.0s)]
*  I'm paying almost half of my income in fucking taxes so you know what the car size mystery [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1616.0s)]
*  things flying over the cities are. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1623.0s)]
*  And you don't know what that fucking is? [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1625.0s)]
*  What am I paying you for? [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1627.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1629.0s)]
*  You're making a lot of money, man. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1630.0s)]
*  You should know what the drones are. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1632.0s)]
*  And so but then when you see what's his name? [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1634.0s)]
*  Bolt? Is it Bolton? [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1637.0s)]
*  The guy with the mustache? [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1638.0s)]
*  Not Bolton. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1640.0s)]
*  When you see, I don't know, the DOD dudes up there in the way that they're just lying [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1641.0s)]
*  their fucking asses off. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1646.0s)]
*  Did you see the press secretary talking about it? [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1647.0s)]
*  And she's wearing a necklace that looks like a UFO. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1649.0s)]
*  Is it Corrine Jean-Pierre, that lady? [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1653.0s)]
*  Not Jean-Pierre. It was another one. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1655.0s)]
*  It was some print. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1656.0s)]
*  A new one? [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1657.0s)]
*  It was a... [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1658.0s)]
*  How do they just shuffle new people in without announcing them? [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1659.0s)]
*  No, I don't think they got rid of Pierre. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1661.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1663.0s)]
*  I hope not. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1664.0s)]
*  Because most of them don't last as long as Pierre. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1665.0s)]
*  She's like the marathoner. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1666.0s)]
*  Oh, dude. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1668.0s)]
*  Most of them, they quit that job. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1669.0s)]
*  They're like, fuck this job. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1670.0s)]
*  I just gotta lie all the time? [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1672.0s)]
*  Horrible. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1673.0s)]
*  Horrible. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1674.0s)]
*  Imagine like dunking this is what you're gonna sell. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1675.0s)]
*  War with Sudan. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1677.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1679.0s)]
*  Okay? Here's the reason why. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1680.0s)]
*  The rebels, children problems. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1681.0s)]
*  Children problems. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1683.0s)]
*  Economy. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1684.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1685.0s)]
*  Pollution. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1686.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1687.0s)]
*  You know, we gotta vaccinate them. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1688.0s)]
*  Got it. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1689.0s)]
*  We can tell this. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1690.0s)]
*  There's a lot of data right now. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1691.0s)]
*  Sell this. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1692.0s)]
*  But I got... [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1693.0s)]
*  And then... [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1694.0s)]
*  What about the data showing vaccinations are bad for you? [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1695.0s)]
*  No, no, fuck that data. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1696.0s)]
*  These people are in trouble and we need to help them. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1697.6s)]
*  We need to help them. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1700.36s)]
*  So war, Sudan, war, Sudan. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1701.36s)]
*  War, Sudan. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1702.36s)]
*  War, Sudan. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1703.36s)]
*  Very important. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1704.36s)]
*  Got it. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1705.36s)]
*  Okay, no problem. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1706.36s)]
*  Sell it. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1707.36s)]
*  Sell it. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1708.36s)]
*  Okay, I got it. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1709.36s)]
*  I'll sell it. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1710.36s)]
*  I'm going out there. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1711.36s)]
*  Okay, you just put on your Rachel Maddow glasses. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1712.36s)]
*  The Rachel Maddow glasses. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1713.36s)]
*  Everybody's wearing them to look super serious. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1714.36s)]
*  Well, this is... [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1715.36s)]
*  It's part of the costume, isn't it? [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1716.72s)]
*  It is. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1718.2s)]
*  And you know, we also, by the way... [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1719.2s)]
*  We're in costumes while we're saying this. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1720.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1722.84s)]
*  We are in elf costumes. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1723.84s)]
*  But yeah, I don't understand the Rachel Maddow glasses phenomena, but I have done research [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1726.1599999999999s)]
*  into it because I wanted to create a vision board of all the people wearing those glasses. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1733.52s)]
*  And it's a thing. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1739.12s)]
*  It's like a thing on the left. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1740.12s)]
*  They wear those fucking glasses. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1741.68s)]
*  It identifies that you have a certain set of beliefs if you're wearing the Maddow glasses. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1742.96s)]
*  I mean, it's a real thing. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1748.56s)]
*  It is a real thing. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1750.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1751.0s)]
*  If you have those glasses on and you're a Republican, you're an assassin. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1752.0s)]
*  You're a guy who kills people for a living. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1756.0s)]
*  You're a very strange person. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1760.24s)]
*  Dude, isn't that... [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1761.96s)]
*  But that's, to me, the invasion of the body snatchers experience. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1762.96s)]
*  Have you seen that movie in a while? [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1766.4s)]
*  The remake? [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1768.76s)]
*  I saw the remake, but it was a long time ago, right? [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1770.16s)]
*  Wasn't it like five years ago? [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1772.96s)]
*  How long ago was it? [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1773.96s)]
*  I think it's from... [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1775.44s)]
*  The one I like is from the 70s. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1776.44s)]
*  Oh, the Donald Southerland one. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1777.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1779.0s)]
*  That one's amazing. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1780.0s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1781.0s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1782.0s)]
*  They point at you and make that noise. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1783.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1785.0s)]
*  Oh, that's it. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1786.0s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1787.0s)]
*  Oh, Southerland killing it. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1788.0s)]
*  Look how creepy his eyes are. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1790.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1793.0s)]
*  Bro, can you imagine that reality? [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1795.0s)]
*  And by the way, not that hard. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1800.0s)]
*  You know what's way harder than that? [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1802.0s)]
*  Building a planet. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1804.0s)]
*  There's plenty of planets. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1806.0s)]
*  That is not that hard. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1808.0s)]
*  That is essentially what happens all the time in the insect kingdom where they get infested [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1809.0s)]
*  by another parasite that controls their brain. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1815.0s)]
*  There you go. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1817.0s)]
*  Dude, I went down a deep rabbit hole with this shit because I was looking right after [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1818.0s)]
*  Trump won, which by the way, I want to remind you, I'm sorry, I don't want to pat myself [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1824.0s)]
*  on the back, but when we were hunting for Bigfoot, do you remember I said to you, one [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1828.0s)]
*  day you're going to get a president elected? [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1833.0s)]
*  Did you say that? [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1835.0s)]
*  No. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1836.0s)]
*  Back then that would have been the least likely scenario. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1837.0s)]
*  I'm in the woods with the Fear Factor guy. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1841.0s)]
*  And we're legitimately looking for Bigfoot. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1844.0s)]
*  Legitimately. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1849.0s)]
*  Legitimately with Bigfoot experts. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1850.0s)]
*  Dude, that was one of my favorite camping trips I've ever had in my life. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1851.0s)]
*  It was fun, dude. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1854.0s)]
*  I would love to do that again. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1855.0s)]
*  Hunting for Bigfoot. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1857.0s)]
*  It's like, because hunting for animals, which I know you love, I have nothing against it, [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1858.0s)]
*  but you still got to kill an animal. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1862.0s)]
*  Hunting for Bigfoot? [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1864.0s)]
*  You just look for a twig out of place and you get to imagine he's nearby. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1865.0s)]
*  It's really fun. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1871.0s)]
*  Squatching is fun. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1872.0s)]
*  Somebody asked me if I saw Bigfoot, would I kill it? [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1873.0s)]
*  Because if I could kill it, then I could show people that it's real. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1877.0s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1881.0s)]
*  Interesting, would you? [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1882.0s)]
*  No. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1884.0s)]
*  Why would I kill Bigfoot? [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1885.0s)]
*  Well. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1886.0s)]
*  But why would you do that? [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1887.0s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1889.0s)]
*  Just to prove that it's real? [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1890.0s)]
*  Well, guess what? [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1891.0s)]
*  Guess we can't prove it. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1892.0s)]
*  There's no other way. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1893.0s)]
*  It's not like I tell you where it happened and you fucking close off a thousand square [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1894.0s)]
*  miles and start pushing in with soldiers. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1898.28s)]
*  Well. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1901.0s)]
*  Don't kill it. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1902.0s)]
*  Why would you kill it, stupid? [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1903.0s)]
*  I'm telling you where it is. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1904.56s)]
*  Why do you want me to shoot an arrow through it? [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1905.56s)]
*  You know, man. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1907.0s)]
*  Why don't you just trust me and spend a billion dollars on drones? [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1908.0s)]
*  Imagine, like, why did we spend all this money? [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1911.0s)]
*  Oh, Joe said he saw Bigfoot and so we weren't looking. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1914.0s)]
*  But by the fucking way. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1918.0s)]
*  No one would spend any money to go look for Bigfoot. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1919.0s)]
*  You can fly a swarm of drones over fucking New Jersey. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1922.0s)]
*  You could find Bigfoot. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1926.0s)]
*  You could fly him in the Pacific Northwest and we'd know once and fucking for all. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1927.0s)]
*  See, this, you know, they talk about democracy. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1931.0s)]
*  Sometimes I like to think about what would actual democracy look like? [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1934.0s)]
*  And you know, it wouldn't look like some dude getting in front of a microphone and gaslighting [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1938.0s)]
*  your ass about experimental craft. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1943.2s)]
*  It would be like, all right, I'm just going to tell you guys, we figured out anti-gravity. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1945.0s)]
*  That's anti-gravity drones. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1951.0s)]
*  We wanted to show you. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1953.0s)]
*  And tomorrow we're going to drop ketamine on the neighborhoods. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1954.0s)]
*  Democracy. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1959.0s)]
*  But you know what I mean? [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1961.0s)]
*  Like, that would be true democracy versus what we have right now, which is sort of democracy. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1963.0s)]
*  It does work. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1970.0s)]
*  The voting works and all that stuff. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1971.0s)]
*  But ultimately, our impact, the non-political classes impact is very little. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1973.0s)]
*  And the political classes impact is very little when you consider now there's a security class. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1979.0s)]
*  So you have the politicians like Harry Reid trying to figure out what the fuck is going on with the UAPs. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1984.0s)]
*  And even they can't do it because there's another level in that level is like that's that those are the people controlling things because they know the secrets. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=1990.0s)]
*  It's just so infuriating to me that now they feel comfortable enough to fly whatever the fuck these things are over a major city and not tell us what they are and then say we don't know what they are. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2000.0s)]
*  Because if the realities, they don't know what they are. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2013.0s)]
*  If we're going to believe them, which I guess you're not just not supposed to. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2016.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2022.0s)]
*  Are you supposed to? [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2023.0s)]
*  No, I don't think you're supposed to. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2024.0s)]
*  I think at the point where they're just telling you it's like stars. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2025.0s)]
*  But let's be honest. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2029.0s)]
*  If you are in possession of the actual information, you know what it is. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2030.0s)]
*  You know it's China or you know it's aliens or you know it's a combination of both. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2036.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2041.0s)]
*  Or it's US government or it's all three. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2042.0s)]
*  Maybe it's all the above. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2044.0s)]
*  How the fuck do you tell people that? [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2046.0s)]
*  How do you tell people that while you're also governing? [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2048.0s)]
*  You're also doing all these different things. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2051.0s)]
*  You're very busy. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2053.0s)]
*  How does the president get on television and say ladies and gentlemen, aliens are real? [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2054.0s)]
*  We are being visited on a regular basis by non-human intelligence that is far superior to our own. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2059.0s)]
*  We don't understand why they're here. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2068.0s)]
*  We have been working with them. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2070.0s)]
*  We have back engineered their products. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2072.0s)]
*  That's how you got fiber optics and capacitors and all these things that sort of emerged after Roswell. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2074.0s)]
*  That's the most fun one. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2081.0s)]
*  You were bioengineered. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2083.0s)]
*  They seeded your culture with your religions. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2084.0s)]
*  Everything. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2088.0s)]
*  It's for a good cause. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2089.0s)]
*  Everything. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2090.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2091.0s)]
*  We're a piece of the fucking factory, dude. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2092.0s)]
*  That's what we are. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2094.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2095.0s)]
*  We're a piece of the factory that doesn't recognize that there's a whole other building connected to this that's filled with machines. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2096.0s)]
*  We're a piece. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2103.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2104.0s)]
*  So that is exactly what you want pieces of your factory to think like. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2105.0s)]
*  And that is why at any moment anybody can actually just turn the channel. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2112.0s)]
*  You're not a piece of the fucking factory. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2117.0s)]
*  Actually, you're the universe. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2120.0s)]
*  You are the universe. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2122.0s)]
*  And you're the universe who has been. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2123.0s)]
*  Dude, I mean, look what they could do to a lion at a circus. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2125.0s)]
*  It's a deadly fucking thing. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2130.0s)]
*  They can make it jump through hoops. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2132.0s)]
*  They can make it catch a frisbee. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2134.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2136.0s)]
*  Most of the time. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2137.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2139.0s)]
*  When they can't, those make for some wild Instagram videos. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2140.0s)]
*  Oh, they do. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2145.0s)]
*  There's a lot of those out there. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2146.0s)]
*  There is. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2147.0s)]
*  It's the assassination of a fucking CEO. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2148.0s)]
*  And by the way, I am not assigning any kind of like, I think it's a slippery slope if we start publicly fucking executing CEOs. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2150.0s)]
*  Like if you start, you know what I mean? [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2160.0s)]
*  That's a real slippery slope. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2161.0s)]
*  It's super slippery. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2163.0s)]
*  But I'll tell you, if you sort of look at the factory, the way it works is like, number one, you really aren't supposed to identify the actual like what's causing like a lot of suffering. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2164.0s)]
*  Like once you start making those identifications, then and you follow through with some kind of action based on those identifications. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2178.0s)]
*  Number one, the action can't be based on the rules of the factory. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2187.0s)]
*  Of course, the factory is going to create up create rules. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2191.0s)]
*  You can go out with your fucking signs or whatever if you're at the right place, not at him Amazon where they arrested those people protesting. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2194.0s)]
*  But there's places in the factory where you can go and be like, I need more oil. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2200.0s)]
*  I'm squeaking. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2205.0s)]
*  But that but only once in a while and only in the right way. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2207.0s)]
*  It's a peaceful protest is what we call it. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2209.0s)]
*  You do it at the wrong time. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2211.0s)]
*  It's a fucking insurrection. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2213.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2215.0s)]
*  So the factory's got rules about how we do this. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2216.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2218.0s)]
*  So the moment you go outside of those rules, the moment you like actually and to do that, you have to somehow really think outside the factory. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2219.0s)]
*  Then then you see something like that happen. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2227.0s)]
*  And then you see the way the factory responds, which is the perp walk they did with that dude. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2230.0s)]
*  They've got fucking SEAL Team Six walking that guy in. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2236.0s)]
*  He's handsome. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2239.0s)]
*  He's a movie. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2240.0s)]
*  It's like a movie. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2241.0s)]
*  If you saw that handsome guy getting arrested and it was like SEAL Team Six behind and protecting. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2243.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2247.0s)]
*  You'd be like, that's no way they would do that. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2248.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2250.0s)]
*  It's just a regular killer. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2251.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2252.0s)]
*  There's no way they would have that many guys guarding that guy. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2253.0s)]
*  Well, they're not guarding that guy. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2255.0s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2257.0s)]
*  They're sending a fucking message. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2258.0s)]
*  They're saying, listen, we will surround you. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2259.0s)]
*  And like that. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2262.0s)]
*  So because like what's really scary about what he did is like and I think if you want to like take murder, cold blooded murder and just for a second call it activism. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2263.0s)]
*  What that guy did is he didn't just like, you know, send a message, which is really scary for people like CEOs, which is saying, listen, man, like you can't keep fucking us with the insurance. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2276.0s)]
*  If you do, you're not safe. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2291.0s)]
*  And so that's scary as fuck because that's the CEOs, of course, are the ones who pay for the lobbyists, who pay for the laws. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2294.0s)]
*  And so he sends a message of a methodology, which again, I think if we if we're going to get into a better place, you can using violence. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2300.0s)]
*  I just don't think that's the path. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2313.0s)]
*  But just as an analysis dude, I would say you could expect more of that to happen. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2316.0s)]
*  And and that is going to lead to the Darth Vader people coming out more. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2322.0s)]
*  You're not cosigning it. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2327.0s)]
*  I'm not cosigning it at all. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2329.0s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2331.0s)]
*  It's a realistic assessment. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2332.0s)]
*  There's something going on. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2334.0s)]
*  People are very upset and they've been able to do this to people for so long. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2335.0s)]
*  Deny people treatment for so long. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2340.0s)]
*  You remember when your dad had to come downstairs like you're fucking up or you're like misbehaving with your brother. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2342.0s)]
*  You're doing something really bad. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2349.0s)]
*  You set something on fire. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2350.0s)]
*  Right. Your dad comes downstairs. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2351.0s)]
*  He's been at work. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2353.0s)]
*  He's fucking pissed. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2354.0s)]
*  That's how you know you're really fucked. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2355.0s)]
*  When people start doing stuff like that, then the dad has to come downstairs. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2357.0s)]
*  And when the dad comes downstairs, it looks like the dudes in the Darth Vader outfits. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2361.0s)]
*  All of a sudden, this, you know, this facade for a second, they have to stop the show, turn on the fucking lights. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2365.0s)]
*  These guys in fucking full body armor come out, spray chemicals into your face and drag you away. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2372.0s)]
*  And then, all right, start the show up again, start the show up again. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2380.0s)]
*  It gets memory hold. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2383.0s)]
*  So that that is an example of what happens when the factory is imbalanced. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2384.0s)]
*  And right now, the factory is imbalanced, dude. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2390.0s)]
*  It's just that's the problem. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2392.0s)]
*  There's a reason we need the middle class. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2394.0s)]
*  There's a reason you need some path forward. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2395.0s)]
*  That is, there's a reason you need to be able to buy a fucking house. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2398.0s)]
*  And aside from like the human comfort and starting a family and all that stuff, the moment you pull that away from people, now what? [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2401.0s)]
*  It's like, so wait, they're what am I supposed to do here? [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2410.0s)]
*  Now, again, I am not advocating violence. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2414.0s)]
*  I think that if we keep doing violence, we're going to keep getting violence. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2419.0s)]
*  But it's a really scary thing when shit gets so imbalanced. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2423.0s)]
*  And when you hear about like the health insurance, I'm lucky because like I'm on this. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2428.0s)]
*  I'm on Crapopolis on Fox. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2433.0s)]
*  I have incredible health insurance, dude. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2435.0s)]
*  But like you read about the people denying like really important medication, really important procedures to people, [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2437.0s)]
*  sending them stacks of paper explaining why we're not going to pay. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2447.0s)]
*  You know, I got my colonoscopy recently. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2454.0s)]
*  It cost me $100. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2457.0s)]
*  You know how much they charged my insurance company? [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2458.0s)]
*  $9,000. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2460.0s)]
*  Have you ever talked to Brigham Bueller about this? [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2462.0s)]
*  No. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2464.0s)]
*  I should. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2465.0s)]
*  You know, because he understands it from top to bottom. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2466.0s)]
*  He can tell you exactly what's going on. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2470.0s)]
*  He's talked about it on the podcast. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2472.0s)]
*  But it's, you know, it's a giant machine. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2474.0s)]
*  It's a giant money machine. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2477.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2479.0s)]
*  That's really what it is. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2480.0s)]
*  It's not really about making you better. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2481.0s)]
*  It's about it's a giant money machine. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2482.0s)]
*  Making you better is what they sell. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2484.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2486.0s)]
*  But it's about making more money. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2487.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2488.0s)]
*  And they can make incredible amounts of money for surgeries that maybe you don't need. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2489.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2494.0s)]
*  You know, I'm not saying everybody does it, but some people do it. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2495.0s)]
*  It's been, it's this, there's a guy that just got arrested recently. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2497.0s)]
*  I don't know if you heard about this guy. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2500.0s)]
*  I sent this to Peter Attia. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2502.0s)]
*  I could send it to you, Jamie, or maybe you could find it. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2504.0s)]
*  This dude, he was telling people they had cancer and they didn't. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2506.0s)]
*  And it was like a ton of cases. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2512.0s)]
*  And you'd give them chemotherapy, man. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2515.0s)]
*  And he'd make them like severely ill. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2518.0s)]
*  Yeah. Demon. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2520.0s)]
*  He did it to like, I don't know. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2521.0s)]
*  I don't remember the number because I think the number stunned me so much. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2523.0s)]
*  I didn't want to remember it. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2527.0s)]
*  But this guy told a ton of people they had cancer. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2529.0s)]
*  Just scared the fuck out of them, ruined their lives. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2532.0s)]
*  Dude. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2535.0s)]
*  And then gave them poison that's designed to kill cancer. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2536.0s)]
*  Is it a few, like 10 years old? [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2540.0s)]
*  It could have been. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2542.0s)]
*  Someone sent it to me on Instagram. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2543.0s)]
*  It was a news story. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2546.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2547.0s)]
*  He got 45. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2549.0s)]
*  That's all he got was 45 years. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2550.0s)]
*  That's a pretty long time. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2552.0s)]
*  13 counts. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2553.0s)]
*  He's 50. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2554.0s)]
*  That's a life sentence. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2555.0s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2557.0s)]
*  Well, yeah, man. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2559.0s)]
*  I don't know if this is the same guy. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2560.0s)]
*  Maybe more doctors have done it. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2564.0s)]
*  I did try. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2565.0s)]
*  You know, this is one of the things that I found out I was doing a bit about this fertility clinic doctor that was using his own jizz. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2566.0s)]
*  That's not one case. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2573.0s)]
*  There's a fucking shit ton of cases. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2575.0s)]
*  I wonder how many of these doctors were... [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2577.0s)]
*  There's these creepy doctors. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2581.0s)]
*  Just like there's creepy carpenters. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2583.0s)]
*  Just like there's, you know, like some doctors don't give a fuck about people. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2586.0s)]
*  Why do they use their own jizz? [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2590.0s)]
*  They want all the babies. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2592.0s)]
*  They want everyone to have their baby. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2593.0s)]
*  They're just psychos. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2595.0s)]
*  People aren't coming in. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2597.0s)]
*  No, there's women that went in with their husbands' jizz. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2598.0s)]
*  And he's like, eh, I gotta buy her up. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2601.0s)]
*  She'll fool you, sweetheart. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2603.0s)]
*  That's what this guy did. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2605.0s)]
*  He ran a fertility clinic and I think people started figuring it out when 23andMe came around. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2606.0s)]
*  And this is just one of these guys. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2611.0s)]
*  There's been a ton of those guys. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2613.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2615.0s)]
*  That fundamentally is the difference between men and women. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2616.0s)]
*  Could you imagine a clinic where a woman was getting other people to carry her babies? [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2620.0s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2629.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2631.0s)]
*  Not a chance in the fucking world. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2632.0s)]
*  No woman would want that. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2633.0s)]
*  Yeah, take my baby. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2634.0s)]
*  You take my baby. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2635.0s)]
*  I trust it with you. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2636.0s)]
*  You don't, the guy I don't even know, have a baby with me. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2637.0s)]
*  Have the most precious thing. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2640.0s)]
*  You can have it. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2642.0s)]
*  You can have it. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2643.0s)]
*  You can have it. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2644.0s)]
*  It's literally the fundamental difference between men and women that a guy could run a sperm clinic and think I'm going to get away with everybody having my babies. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2645.0s)]
*  And he doesn't give a fuck what happens to those kids. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2654.0s)]
*  Because they might fuck. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2657.0s)]
*  They might fuck. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2658.0s)]
*  They might not know. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2659.0s)]
*  They might find out. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2660.0s)]
*  223andMe, they're trying to find out. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2661.0s)]
*  They might find out 223andMe, they're cousins. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2663.0s)]
*  Like holy shit, we're cousins. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2666.0s)]
*  And then you find out everyone's a cousin. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2668.0s)]
*  Because this creep's been just using his own jizz for 35 years. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2670.0s)]
*  Dude, that guy could be like, you know, based on the depopulation that's happening, based on population decline, that guy could be like the next Genghis Khan. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2673.0s)]
*  Like in the future, like 80% of the planet's related to this dude. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2681.0s)]
*  I think he's got a lot of catching up to do to get where Genghis Khan's numbers were. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2688.0s)]
*  It is interesting. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2692.0s)]
*  It's like, you know, you read Elon Musk is the top Diablo player in North America, right? [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2693.0s)]
*  I think in the world, dude. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2699.0s)]
*  In the world. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2701.0s)]
*  I think he's number one in the world, which is fucking insane. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2702.0s)]
*  And dude, I know you. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2705.0s)]
*  And I'm not trying to high road you here. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2707.0s)]
*  But unless you've played Diablo 4, you can't understand what that means. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2709.0s)]
*  I absolutely accept that. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2716.0s)]
*  I do not understand what that means. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2718.0s)]
*  It is insane. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2719.0s)]
*  Like when I was addicted to that fucking game, like I just wasn't sleeping because, you know, I had to do dad duty in the day, Diablo at night. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2721.0s)]
*  And I was I sucked. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2729.0s)]
*  So when you realize this guy shooting rockets into space, making e-vehicles, starting a new fucking Department of the government is also the top. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2731.0s)]
*  It's so crazy. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2745.0s)]
*  It's the one time I actually let myself think maybe he actually is an alien because there is no there's just no way unless he's paying people to do it for him, which obviously he's not. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2747.0s)]
*  That is that is insane, man. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2758.0s)]
*  That is insane. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2761.0s)]
*  So, dude, when you when you consider, I don't even know where I was going with that. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2762.0s)]
*  I got lost in Diablo 4. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2766.0s)]
*  Just thinking about it. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2768.0s)]
*  We were just talking about how he was the number. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2769.0s)]
*  He's the number one player that Elon, how preposterous it is. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2771.0s)]
*  It's no, it's that I don't know. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2775.0s)]
*  I don't play Diablo 4, so I really don't know what that means. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2777.0s)]
*  But I believe it's huge. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2780.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2782.0s)]
*  Like, it's crazy. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2783.0s)]
*  It's crazy because, you know, Diablo 4, it's all about your build. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2785.0s)]
*  It's all about like it. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2788.0s)]
*  I hand coordination is obviously a big part of it. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2790.0s)]
*  But then it's just and then you see the chopsticks catch the fucking rocket. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2793.0s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, that's a side job. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2800.0s)]
*  Side job. He's had more space innovation in the last five years than NASA has since the Apollo missions. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2803.0s)]
*  It's amazing. I mean, I'm just saying that. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2811.0s)]
*  I don't know if it's a true number, but he gets rockets to land and rockets get caught with robot arms. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2813.0s)]
*  What? And that to me, it's like, my God, you know, you get those feelings like, OK, I'm on the right timeline. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2820.0s)]
*  If the guy who's going to make us a galactic civilization is also a master Diablo player, the number one, we're in the right timeline. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2825.0s)]
*  It seems so unlikely that if it was in a movie, I go, shut the fuck up. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2837.0s)]
*  He's not the number one Diablo player. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2843.0s)]
*  I don't care how smart he is with rockets and electric cars and satellites that give broadband Internet and tunneling under the earth. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2845.0s)]
*  And also owns X. It's suspicious. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2854.0s)]
*  I must say it's and he's tweeting 48 times an hour. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2858.0s)]
*  He's he's so prolific. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2863.0s)]
*  Well, like where where's your head? [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2865.0s)]
*  One of the it's like he's in another dimension. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2868.0s)]
*  He could be he could be by locating like this is one of the ideas. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2871.0s)]
*  Is there where are you actually physically? [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2874.0s)]
*  Is this a is this an avatar? [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2876.0s)]
*  OK, here's an here's something. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2879.0s)]
*  I just fully believes it's simulation, by the way. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2881.0s)]
*  Oh, he does. Oh, fully. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2883.0s)]
*  Not only does he say fully, but he says the chances of it not being a he said this publicly, the chances of it not being a simulation are in the billions. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2885.0s)]
*  I mean, OK, so we talked about this in the green room. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2894.0s)]
*  Willow, the new quantum chip that Google is right. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2899.0s)]
*  So I think you and I both do the same thing with our minds. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2903.0s)]
*  I think anyone who is exposed to the Atari 2600 does this naturally, which is like we play the Atari 2600. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2906.0s)]
*  Did you have an Atari when you were a kid? [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2913.0s)]
*  Yeah. And you remember how that blew your mind? [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2915.0s)]
*  Right. You control the thing with the joystick was insane. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2917.0s)]
*  You can control the buttons. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2920.0s)]
*  What the fuck? Yeah. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2922.0s)]
*  Like you readable you'd been going to arcades. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2924.0s)]
*  You can only play for a second. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2926.0s)]
*  You have enough quarters. Suddenly you could just do it at home. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2928.0s)]
*  You could play till you fainted. Oh, my God. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2931.0s)]
*  And and so we got to witness like every phase of that technology to where it is now, which is just fucking insane. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2933.0s)]
*  And so you just take the Atari 2600 model and apply it to any new thing. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2940.0s)]
*  And so you think, all right, what's it going to look like in 10 years? [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2946.0s)]
*  Then you take Musk's neural lace, what some kind of brain human interface, mix that in with some quantum chip. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2949.0s)]
*  Yeah, right now, right now, it's apparently unstable. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2959.0s)]
*  It's like you've got to keep it at like you have to keep it at the low. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2963.0s)]
*  I don't know what it's called. It's like colder than space or something like it has to be basically below freezing. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2967.0s)]
*  And then suddenly it can do things that all the supercomputers on the planet couldn't do. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2973.0s)]
*  But, you know, there's a trajectory here between the human brain and this technology. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2979.0s)]
*  And it's getting closer and closer and closer together, [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2984.0s)]
*  meaning that we are and you know, a lot of people are like, look, that's probably like 20 years away. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2987.0s)]
*  That is not that long. We are. When did Teen Wolf come out, man? [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2992.0s)]
*  I don't think it's anywhere near 20 years. I think it's way closer than that. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=2998.0s)]
*  That's right. So that that to me, when you when you just do the math and you realize humanity is about to merge [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3001.0s)]
*  with a thing that is solving equations that all the super take a supercomputer. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3010.0s)]
*  What is it? Double Tillion amount of years. That's going to be us. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3016.0s)]
*  Yeah. And so then to answer the simulation idea, of course, we're in a simulation. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3020.0s)]
*  If we were just monkeys and now we are using qubits, [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3025.0s)]
*  using superpositioning to create some infinitely faster way of calculating data, [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3031.0s)]
*  then obviously, once we get that thing connected to our brain, [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3038.0s)]
*  we will be able to simulate any reality we want if this is truly our past. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3044.0s)]
*  And you wanted to like right now, the way I remember something, having done acid for most of my life is very foggy and kind of like my memory isn't the best. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3050.0s)]
*  Every once in a while, I have a very clear memory of things. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3059.0s)]
*  But with this tech, theoretically, it could reconstruct memories in your mind and not just that, [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3061.0s)]
*  put you into them and allow you to experience them in real time, meaning in a few minutes you could live your life over a thousand times. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3067.0s)]
*  Easily, we could just be in we could be in the future. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3074.0s)]
*  And this is a memory that some quantum computer of neural interface is allowing us to experience totally all encompassing memory. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3077.0s)]
*  And that would be a form of eternal life because in every second, [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3086.0s)]
*  how many lifetimes could you live based on merging with that kind of chip? [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3089.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3094.0s)]
*  And you wouldn't want to know it was a memory. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3095.0s)]
*  You know, you might want to be like, you know what, let me just live that life over again. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3097.0s)]
*  I just want to feel the whole thing. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3100.0s)]
*  Well, you know, that's one of the scariest things for people to consider is the there's this. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3102.0s)]
*  I asked someone once, would you rather die or would you rather live your life over and over and over again forever? [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3110.0s)]
*  What they say? [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3121.0s)]
*  They're like, oh, my God, I couldn't do this forever and ever and ever. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3122.0s)]
*  I'm like, why not? Can you can you can do it now? [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3125.0s)]
*  Like, it's not even hard. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3127.0s)]
*  But aren't you enjoying life? [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3128.0s)]
*  Like, I love it. I'm having a great time. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3129.0s)]
*  I have great friends. I have a lot of fun. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3131.0s)]
*  Lots of amazing things. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3134.0s)]
*  I have a great family. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3136.0s)]
*  I enjoy what I do for a living. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3137.0s)]
*  Like, why would no one keep doing this? [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3139.0s)]
*  But the thought of keeping even for me, the thought of me doing this forever and ever and ever is fucking terrifying. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3140.0s)]
*  Yeah. For some weird reason. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3147.0s)]
*  Well, that was like Nietzsche had this whole thought experiment, which was I don't remember what it's called. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3149.0s)]
*  Something like infinite return. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3154.0s)]
*  But basically, the way he put it is you don't live it again and again and again and make changes within the echo. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3155.0s)]
*  It's exactly the same over and over and over again. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3163.0s)]
*  And so in other words, like whatever you it's just a rerun over and over and over again forever. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3166.0s)]
*  That's what we're in. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3172.0s)]
*  And his point in that was like, therefore, if most of your life you've been miserable, you're in hell. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3173.0s)]
*  I know. But he wanted to use that more as a kind of to leverage people out of despondency, to make them understand. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3185.0s)]
*  Get going now. Make it happy now. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3194.0s)]
*  Because if we do repeat. Yeah. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3196.0s)]
*  But dude, I think that by all this measure of talking about like quantum computers and artificial intelligence and all these emerging things, [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3199.0s)]
*  isn't it more likely then that a lot of this shit that people are seeing is human created? [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3208.0s)]
*  Because isn't it more likely that if we really do get to some sort of quantum computer, AI civilization, [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3214.0s)]
*  so you attach quantum computer with AI like 20 years from now? [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3223.0s)]
*  What does that even mean? Did you just make a God? [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3227.0s)]
*  And if you did, it can this thing just completely travel between dimensions and understand like everything about every subatomic subatomic particle that exists in the entire universe? [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3230.0s)]
*  Yeah. All at once. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3244.0s)]
*  Like if that's the case, like why do you need people anymore? [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3245.0s)]
*  Maybe you don't just make it like maybe Australia Pythagoras isn't around anymore. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3248.0s)]
*  That was our guy. Right. He was our guy. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3252.0s)]
*  If it wasn't for him, we wouldn't be here. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3254.0s)]
*  Allegedly. Well, I mean, I think the model you could use for that theory would be the the the various like you look at the an embryo and then you watch the way the appendages change. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3256.0s)]
*  Then you could look at it that way, which is like, well, I mean, you don't want I met someone who had a tail, by the way, like some people get born. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3272.0s)]
*  I think I was at that party. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3285.0s)]
*  I met someone who had a tail. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3291.0s)]
*  Because something happens. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3292.0s)]
*  How big was it? [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3293.0s)]
*  I didn't look at it. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3294.0s)]
*  What did it taste like? [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3295.0s)]
*  Oh, cinnamon. It tasted like cinnamon and whiskey. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3296.0s)]
*  Yeah, dudes are born with like a stub, right? [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3302.0s)]
*  You know, like a regular tailed monkey billy. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3304.0s)]
*  Look at this bitch ass tail. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3306.0s)]
*  Yeah. But there's something to it. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3307.0s)]
*  Something there. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3308.0s)]
*  So, you know, that if you. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3309.0s)]
*  Yeah, there it is. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3312.0s)]
*  There you go. God. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3313.0s)]
*  That's so weird. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3314.0s)]
*  There you go. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3315.0s)]
*  That is like an ancient. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3316.0s)]
*  By the way, if you're born with a tail, I'm not trusting you with my taxes. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3317.0s)]
*  Oh, come on. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3321.0s)]
*  I don't care if you get the surgery. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3322.0s)]
*  Well, it's weird. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3324.0s)]
*  Others like some of those tails look better than others. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3325.0s)]
*  But some of them are clearly got to be fake. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3327.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3329.0s)]
*  Some people probably got surgically put the take off my big toe and stick it on my ass. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3330.0s)]
*  I'm afraid to look at it. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3334.0s)]
*  It's like it goes out there. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3335.0s)]
*  Give me a dude that your alliance fucking bit. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3336.0s)]
*  I still think about it sometimes. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3339.0s)]
*  What would you do if you had a tail? [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3341.0s)]
*  Like, give me a break. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3343.0s)]
*  If you get like if it, you know, they're already getting these body suits you can wear to help help you lift shit. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3344.0s)]
*  They have the new things for your legs that like, oh, you know, but, dude, if there was some cyborg tail that you could attach with a belt. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3350.0s)]
*  What if there was a way? [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3357.0s)]
*  What if genetic engineering and AI merge in a way that like Duncan, we can switch you one time to anything you want. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3359.0s)]
*  And one of the options is you could become one of the Navi. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3367.0s)]
*  What are the Navi? [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3370.0s)]
*  The Navi from the movie Avatar. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3371.0s)]
*  I'm not. I don't want to be a Navi. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3375.0s)]
*  The blue people. Not interested. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3377.0s)]
*  Giant, giant blue people who fucking live in the forest and sleep in the trees and they're connected to the earth. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3378.0s)]
*  Now they dance together. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3383.0s)]
*  No, thank you. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3384.0s)]
*  I'm going to pass on the Navi. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3385.0s)]
*  I don't like it. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3387.0s)]
*  They ride dragons. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3388.0s)]
*  They ride dragons, bro. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3389.0s)]
*  I don't know, man. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3390.0s)]
*  Dude, I wanted to be one of them people so bad. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3392.0s)]
*  Everybody did. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3394.0s)]
*  There was literally a psychological condition called Avatar Depression. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3395.0s)]
*  Yeah, I do. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3399.0s)]
*  How many people just let's just have a guess. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3401.0s)]
*  If I said we could do that to you, how many people do you think would sign up? [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3403.0s)]
*  I think the streets would be filled with giant blue people. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3408.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, if it's only once. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3410.0s)]
*  You have to stay. We can't do it again. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3413.0s)]
*  It's too dangerous. Your DNA gets volatile. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3416.0s)]
*  It melts down. You could become a frog. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3418.0s)]
*  We can't control it, but we can switch you one time. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3420.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's not going to be one time, man. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3423.0s)]
*  No, it's one time. One time. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3425.0s)]
*  Why? [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3427.0s)]
*  Because you either stay a person or you become a werewolf or turn into a Navi. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3428.0s)]
*  Imagine if that was an option. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3434.0s)]
*  Every time the moon goes black, you have to lock yourself in your house. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3437.0s)]
*  Yeah, or you'll kill. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3440.0s)]
*  Or you have to let people know or you'll tear everybody apart. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3441.0s)]
*  You might just jump through the windows of the second floor and roam the streets. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3444.0s)]
*  And it's going to hurt when you change. It's a painful transformation. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3447.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, you're screaming in your back. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3450.0s)]
*  Remember the movie American Werewolf in London when he's like on his back? [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3452.0s)]
*  Dude, the best. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3455.0s)]
*  Oh my, Joe. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3457.0s)]
*  Fucking great movie. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3459.0s)]
*  Here's a movie you've got to watch. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3460.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3462.0s)]
*  The Substance. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3463.0s)]
*  What is that? [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3464.0s)]
*  Dude, I don't want to ruin it for people because it just came out. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3465.0s)]
*  But, you ever watch any Cronenberg movies? [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3468.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3472.0s)]
*  Okay, so it reminds me of that. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3473.0s)]
*  It's got Demi Moore in it who, by the way, looks so great. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3475.0s)]
*  And she's like, dude, it is so fucked up. This movie is so fucked up. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3479.0s)]
*  But it's got the effects. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3484.0s)]
*  Something that happens in it is very similar to an American Werewolf in London. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3486.0s)]
*  And it's basically this star. She's a fading star. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3491.0s)]
*  And so, oh, and he kills it too. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3495.0s)]
*  But she's like a fading star. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3499.0s)]
*  So it's called The Substance? [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3501.0s)]
*  Oh my god, it's fucking trippy, man. It's so good. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3502.0s)]
*  I'm going to make a note, Duncan. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3505.0s)]
*  You will love it. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3507.0s)]
*  I can't use, I have to take my gloves off. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3508.0s)]
*  But it's really wild, man. And it's very, there's parts of it that are so disturbing. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3511.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3516.0s)]
*  Oh, maybe they're going to show it. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3517.0s)]
*  The Substance. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3518.0s)]
*  No spoilers. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3520.0s)]
*  You've seen it? [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3522.0s)]
*  No, but if you say it's that good, then why see something? [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3523.0s)]
*  I'm sorry, so what is it on again? [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3527.0s)]
*  We had to get it on Prime. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3529.0s)]
*  Oh, okay. So it's out. It's out. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3531.0s)]
*  But, dude, this is again, and I think one of the fun things about being alive right now. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3533.0s)]
*  It's a fun time. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3540.0s)]
*  It might be the funnest time anybody's ever had. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3542.0s)]
*  Dude, really? Because if I had to pick time periods. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3544.0s)]
*  Oh, we picked the right one. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3548.0s)]
*  Well, the second one I would pick is when cocaine was legal. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3549.0s)]
*  I think you would have been dead already. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3554.0s)]
*  I would, well, yeah. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3557.0s)]
*  Did I tell you about my buddy Steve? His ophthalmology, he was in his residency. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3559.0s)]
*  He did in Miami in the 80s during the cocaine days. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3565.0s)]
*  No. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3568.0s)]
*  Oh my God, dude. He said every day it was just gunshot wounds and guys with things stuffed up their ass. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3569.0s)]
*  They would get coked up and they'd shove something up their ass to try to cum harder. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3576.0s)]
*  And they just got things stuck up their ass. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3580.0s)]
*  That's a problem. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3583.0s)]
*  GI Joe's. Oh yeah, dude. My friend Steve. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3584.0s)]
*  Shout out to Steve Graham. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3587.0s)]
*  He told me like all kinds of, they find light bulbs, guys that have light bulbs. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3589.0s)]
*  Why light bulbs? [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3593.0s)]
*  Like those twisty little pinecone-y light bulbs. They stick those up their ass. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3594.0s)]
*  But you know it's going to break. Like that's going to break. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3597.0s)]
*  Part of the fun. Part of the fun. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3599.0s)]
*  The risk. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3601.0s)]
*  Well, they're coked out of their fucking minds, dude. They don't know what they're doing. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3603.0s)]
*  This is the 80s in Miami. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3607.0s)]
*  Holy shit, dude. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3609.0s)]
*  Yeah, and there was more banks per capita in Miami at the time. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3611.0s)]
*  I don't know if it's still the case, but more banks in Miami per capita than anywhere else in the country. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3617.0s)]
*  Because it was all just moving in that Yale, son. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3622.0s)]
*  Moving in that Yale. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3626.0s)]
*  It was a cocaine city. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3628.0s)]
*  That was where it was probably somewhat common to find like a bag of coke on the beach, right? [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3631.0s)]
*  Probably every day. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3637.0s)]
*  You'd have to get your kid. Your kid would bring you a bag of coke. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3639.0s)]
*  Like seashells. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3642.0s)]
*  You've seen cocaine cowboys, right? [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3646.0s)]
*  Yes. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3648.0s)]
*  Oh my god. And both. One and two. Both are equally good. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3649.0s)]
*  Dude, I've heard. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3652.0s)]
*  But that story is so insane. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3653.0s)]
*  Again, I would never. I'm too much of a pussy to live that kind of lifestyle. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3655.0s)]
*  But when you think about the possibility that once we do get interfaced in some way or another with these new computers that are just right around the corner, [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3661.0s)]
*  we will be able to simulate experiences like that. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3672.0s)]
*  I would be into simulating the experience. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3677.0s)]
*  And then when you consider, yeah, but you're going to simulate the experience, you know it's a simulation. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3680.0s)]
*  At some point you're going to be like, you know what, let's just turn that off where I know it's a simulation. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3686.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? We would all be doing that shit. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3691.0s)]
*  And I don't just mean like literally like, I mean, at some point you've done 20,000 lifetimes. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3695.0s)]
*  You've experienced what it's like to be George Washington, Genghis Khan. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3702.0s)]
*  You've experienced what it's like to be Joan of Arc. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3705.0s)]
*  You've experienced being one of Jesus's disciples. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3708.0s)]
*  Imagine if that's one person and that's your backstory. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3711.0s)]
*  That you've done all of those things. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3714.0s)]
*  What a timeline you're on. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3716.0s)]
*  That's going to be everybody. That's going to be everybody. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3717.0s)]
*  Because it's going to be fake. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3719.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, is it? [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3720.0s)]
*  Just plug into it. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3721.0s)]
*  That's where it gets really. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3722.0s)]
*  Right. Is it? [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3723.0s)]
*  Is it going to be fake? [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3724.0s)]
*  And what is reality anyway? [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3725.0s)]
*  And what is data? [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3726.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3727.0s)]
*  What is data? That's the real question because it's like how much of data can we recover from light? [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3728.0s)]
*  And if we get faster than light travel, can we get ahead of light? [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3733.0s)]
*  We know that when we take a picture, that's just light. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3736.0s)]
*  So if we can get ahead of light, we can go faster than light. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3738.0s)]
*  If we can go exponentially faster than light, theoretically, you're basically moving into the future, I guess. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3741.0s)]
*  Then couldn't you take pictures of Earth in the past? [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3747.0s)]
*  If you could take pictures of Earth in the past, why couldn't you recreate them with this new technology? [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3750.0s)]
*  There's your time machine. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3755.0s)]
*  You're not you have to worry about fucking up the timelines. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3757.0s)]
*  You're just taking pure data, having it interpolated by whatever the next computer is after quantum wave. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3759.0s)]
*  The next computer is after quantum computers. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3765.0s)]
*  Right. And then simulating that reality and traveling into it as whoever you want to be. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3767.0s)]
*  I mean, it's pure hedonism. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3772.0s)]
*  You know, it's like right now we think of hedonism as fucking great meal, making some money, nice car, red wine. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3775.0s)]
*  But future versions of hedonism could really just be like, I just want to be a dinosaur for 50 years. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3784.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, for sure. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3796.0s)]
*  Well, there's going to be look, think about how many people play video games most of the day. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3798.0s)]
*  Like how many young guys, so many young guys with no girlfriends, 100 percent. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3802.0s)]
*  You're playing some kind of video game all the time with your friends. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3807.0s)]
*  And you're probably having the most fun you're ever going to have in your life. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3811.0s)]
*  So enjoy it. Yeah. Before the prison comes. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3814.0s)]
*  Why? Why'd you say it? [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3819.0s)]
*  Before you get told that you're a toxic piece of shit. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3820.0s)]
*  You can't. And that is, by the way, I think there's a new phase in recently married dudes who I think there's a new phase that happens. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3823.0s)]
*  I think I went through it actually, which is like that experience you had. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3832.0s)]
*  And when I reminisce on my life in the past, prior to having kids, which I fucking love. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3836.0s)]
*  But when I reminisce on the past, the memories that come to mind, a lot of them are like snorting rails of ketamine and playing God of War. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3841.0s)]
*  It was good times. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3853.0s)]
*  But nothing like and I really mean this. It sounds cheesy, but I really mean it. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3860.0s)]
*  Like what I was going for there. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3864.0s)]
*  That's what I get just on any given day. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3867.0s)]
*  When the most right, you're looking for highs in the highs of the love of your families above and beyond anything else. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3870.0s)]
*  Unquantifiable. You ever tell you Chappelle's take on it? [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3877.0s)]
*  No, he goes, not only did increase the love in my life, but it increased my capacity for love. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3880.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. And that can hurt. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3886.0s)]
*  You know, this whole like romantic hippie dippy version of love, it doesn't. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3889.0s)]
*  I don't think that's quite what love is a fairy tale love. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3894.0s)]
*  Real love. It's like that that expansion like, you know, that thing where you go from one size butt plug. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3897.0s)]
*  To the next. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3906.0s)]
*  Yeah, you know that thing. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3909.0s)]
*  But you know what I mean? It's like you it stretches you out in a way that nothing else could have. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3910.0s)]
*  And when you consider and when I think of like the past versions of me and realize in this confused way, that's what you're looking for. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3917.0s)]
*  You're looking for that. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3926.0s)]
*  And that impulse is being subverted or captured by, you know, hedonic technologies that are paradoxically probably keeping you from having that experience. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3928.0s)]
*  You know, they're they're they're getting in the way of that experience. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3941.0s)]
*  But and then and then like new dads, you got to shed that skin like, you know what I mean? [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3944.0s)]
*  I had to like fucking like let go of that. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3949.0s)]
*  That it's such a habit, you know, that form of life, video games, drugs, like, you know what I mean? [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3953.0s)]
*  It's a real it's a real like you have to be responsible now. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3961.0s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. Yeah. But yeah, it probably sounds like a bummer to a lot of people out there. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3964.0s)]
*  But it actually this is the way, you know, and it feels good when you're in it. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3970.0s)]
*  It's just hard to convince people to do it. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3977.0s)]
*  And that's why there's this the Elan's terrified of this population crash, this idea that younger kids, young kids today are not having babies. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3979.0s)]
*  And as they're getting older, you're less and less fertile. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3989.0s)]
*  And so people are choosing to have kids later in life. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3992.0s)]
*  They or not have kids. More people are choosing to not have kids. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3995.0s)]
*  And by the way, I'm not judging to do whatever you do, whatever you want. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=3999.0s)]
*  You should be able to do whatever you want in this life and no one should force you to fucking live with somebody, have a family. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4002.0s)]
*  I don't know what kind of anxiety you have or not. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4007.0s)]
*  You're a real legitimate loner. You like being alone most of the time. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4010.0s)]
*  But it's just like the amount of people that are like super bummed out all the time is quite terrifying. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4014.0s)]
*  Yeah. If you if you really stopped and think about that, just the number of people that are just running through life bummed out. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4022.0s)]
*  I know. And there was some obviously polls. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4028.0s)]
*  Who knows who the fuck is running them? But there was some poll about liberal women and mental illness. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4033.0s)]
*  It's so it's such a meme. It's so unfortunate. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4040.0s)]
*  Yeah, it seems to like hold up to the meme. Yeah. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4044.0s)]
*  So unfortunate. But the numbers like crazy high. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4047.0s)]
*  Well, you know, man, this is the thing about mental illness. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4051.0s)]
*  Like in there's lots of studies that have been what do they call it? [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4055.0s)]
*  A fully ado. Right. That's the name for if you are around a crazy person, it's an you can actually like if you're around a paranoid person long enough, you really might start thinking the walls are bugged if they're charismatic enough. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4058.0s)]
*  Right. Sure. So yeah, there's there's a quality to people who are charismatic and distorting reality that is contagious. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4070.0s)]
*  And then when you add to it, it becomes a fashion statement. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4079.0s)]
*  Right. So so basically, the idea is, if you have some form of mental illness, it's not like I should shame you for it. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4083.0s)]
*  Obviously, like you need care, you need compassion. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4090.0s)]
*  But one of the really, I think, very dangerous things that has emerged into the zeitgeist is that compassion has been confused. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4093.0s)]
*  Like, so in other words, they what you might call enabling, they are calling compassion because the idea would be you're right now. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4103.0s)]
*  You need to get better. Let's get you fucking better. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4112.0s)]
*  Right. Not like right now. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4115.0s)]
*  This is just how you are. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4117.0s)]
*  And you really don't have any hope. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4119.0s)]
*  So this is where and also I congratulate you on your courage. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4121.0s)]
*  And all that's good, by the way, it is courageous if someone has mental illness to announce it. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4126.0s)]
*  But when you go to the next step, which is actually the fact that you're trying to lose weight, the fact that you're trying to balance your life, that is an aggression. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4132.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like now you're aggressing against all the people who have this. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4146.0s)]
*  It is a slap in the face to the people who have it. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4150.0s)]
*  What I'm saying is there's a culture where the normal societal pressure to try to make yourself healthy, which, by the way, if you go back a long time ago, if it's just like you and me and everyone in the green room and we have to survive in the wilderness or something like that, there really isn't time for somebody to, you know, it's dangerous if someone is doing things that keep them sick because we have to carry them. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4152.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? We have to carry them through the fucking wilderness. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4179.0s)]
*  And that means we might die. That lowers our survival chances. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4182.0s)]
*  So the idea is you don't want to enable people who are hurting themselves. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4186.0s)]
*  You don't want to enable people who have a chance to no longer like continue the patterns or take the medicine or whatever the fuck it is to feel better. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4197.0s)]
*  You actually want to help them feel better, not keep them frozen in this thing, which is a demonstration of their enlightenment. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4207.0s)]
*  Because that's the thing when health, when sickness is health and health is sickness. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4216.0s)]
*  Well, that's the ant death spiral, dude. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4222.0s)]
*  Like if, if you know, that's how you create a very sick, unhealthy world. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4224.0s)]
*  And then you, you know, you, you wouldn't want like, in other words, like you, if you met some like raving, paranoid person who was convinced that there were nanobots inside of them that were reading their minds and controlling their thoughts. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4230.0s)]
*  I told you that in private. I'm sorry, Joe. It's just not good that you think like that. That's scary. That's a sad place to be. We got to get you out of there. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4244.0s)]
*  We got to get you on Reddit. Exactly. Exactly. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4252.0s)]
*  And I know bots are legit, dude. Shut the fuck up, dude. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4257.0s)]
*  The main, the main, this is a, this is, you know what I'm really scared of legitimately though. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4261.0s)]
*  I don't think nanobots are controlling us right now, but that this technology that they have where they have these like little miniature robots that they can send into your bloodstream to repair tissue and repair. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4266.0s)]
*  You've seen these right. Yeah. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4277.0s)]
*  Once that becomes an actual thing, like what's the stop someone from injecting a few of those inside of you at the hospital next time you go in for a procedure. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4280.0s)]
*  Right. And if it gets to that point, like 20 years from now where they could do that, they could just like, we, we chip Duncan. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you very much. Yeah. Very important to find out. Yeah. Where, where this guy goes. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4291.0s)]
*  Yeah, we have to track him everywhere he goes. And then you're linked up to some GPS computer by these fucking nanobots inside of your body. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4302.0s)]
*  And by the way, if you and I are talking about this shit in elf suits, you better believe somebody in the DOD, somebody in the Raytheon or Lockheed Martin is like, mention these D these little little robots. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4310.0s)]
*  They do work for a while. What after a while they decay inside your body and they create rampant inflammation, horrible rheumatoid arthritis destroys all of your joints because they die inside of you. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4323.0s)]
*  Well, you know, it's like we didn't know that. Yeah, I didn't know. Got to break a few eggs to make an omelet man. We regret. Yeah. The Tuskegee experiment. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Fuck. Infected people with syphilis. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4337.0s)]
*  I'm really sorry. Tell people they had syphilis. We're sorry. In retrospect, it was a mistake. Like we shouldn't have done that. I mean, the again, how crazy is that? That's a real thing. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4351.0s)]
*  Or when they release some shit in the subways, you know, whoopsie. Whoopsy. That was a big whoopsies boys. Gain of function research. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4361.0s)]
*  Whoopsie. Whoopsie. Whoopsie. No. Whoopsies. It was true. Dude. So when you this is where to me, if you do want to align with a classic paranoid state of consciousness, the way you align with it is you you and without having to go on info wars without having to go on reddit conspiracy, just look at what is true. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4373.0s)]
*  Like is verifiable. Like what do we know right now? So what we know right now, there are unknown drones hovering over New Jersey. We know that the president of the United States has been incapacitated for years. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4393.0s)]
*  For years. No way. Who saw that coming? Dude. We were conspiracy theorists. Not anymore. We were conspiracy theorists. Now our shit is like mainstream, just basic journalism. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4409.0s)]
*  The fucking president of the United States has apparently been out of commission for years. By the way, I welcome him on my podcast. He has an open invitation. God damn it. That'd be awesome. Anytime. And he would be fun. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4422.0s)]
*  I hope so now. Dude. We'd have to give him a little nap in the middle of the podcast, but then wake him up, throw some water on him. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4439.0s)]
*  When he's all there, when they got the cocktail right, and he's like dialed in, and he turns into a warlock for a second, like you get it. It's scary. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4444.0s)]
*  When the eyebrows move up, locks up. That's like something, that's a lich. That's like if you were in a cursed tomb and that thing comes around the corner, that is scary. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4458.0s)]
*  The Sauron that comes out of him before he goes back to sleep is terrifying, but even more terrifying is the network of people around him. You know, you see those, it's really cool, the dancing dragons. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4469.0s)]
*  It's like six dudes in a dragon suit dancing and it looks like a real dragon dancing. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4484.0s)]
*  Biden is the dancing dragon of presidents. He's got God knows how many people just fucking like working so hard to get that thing to function just in like brief moments. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4491.0s)]
*  You only need him to function for like 10 minutes at a press conference, 20 minutes here, get him off the plane, get him in the fucking building. If we can pull that off, we'll have power for a little bit longer, a little bit longer. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4505.0s)]
*  Dude, when you consider that we apparently live in a democracy, you elect this dude who makes decisions because in some way, shape, or form, he aligns with what you want the country to be, and the people fucking puppeteering that poor old man are just like no, actually fuck you. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4516.0s)]
*  He's not going to make any fucking decisions because he's incapacitated. He's gone, gone with a fucking wind, and now we're in control and you didn't vote for us. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4534.0s)]
*  That is terrifying. That is so, that's in a way, that's worse than a coup because at least with a coup, you see the military, they come in, the tanks are in front of the White House, some dude is suddenly the leader, and you know it's not the guy you voted for. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4544.0s)]
*  Well, it was certainly by definition, it was a coup against Biden. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4561.0s)]
*  Oh, with Kamala? [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4566.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4567.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4568.0s)]
*  I mean, isn't that by definition? Does a coup have to be military? [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4569.0s)]
*  Oh, no, no, no. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4573.0s)]
*  What's the definition of a coup? [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4574.0s)]
*  I think a coup is just when you've- [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4576.0s)]
*  Is it just like some sort of a conspiracy to- [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4577.0s)]
*  Overthrow the leader and install a new leader. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4581.0s)]
*  That's it, right? It doesn't have to be violent, right? [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4584.0s)]
*  That's right. And what a brilliant coup. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4586.0s)]
*  I love the bell. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4588.0s)]
*  It does have to be violent? [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4590.0s)]
*  Sudden violent unlawful seizure. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4591.0s)]
*  I guess we have to redefine that. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4593.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4595.0s)]
*  Because again- [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4596.0s)]
*  That's interesting. Is there any other coup d'etat? [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4597.0s)]
*  Maybe- [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4600.0s)]
*  Right. I know it comes from that, but- [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4601.0s)]
*  Is there a difference between a coup and a coup d'etat? What's a coup? [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4603.0s)]
*  No, I think it is coup d'etat. That's the actual definition. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4607.0s)]
*  What's coup? [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4609.0s)]
*  It's the same thing. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4610.0s)]
*  It's the same thing. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4611.0s)]
*  A sudden violent- [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4612.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4613.0s)]
*  In America. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4614.0s)]
*  Essentially, we shortened it. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4616.0s)]
*  So it does say violent, but if there's a bunch of people that conspire behind the scenes, [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4618.0s)]
*  and they force you out, and your wife doesn't want you to get forced out, [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4626.0s)]
*  and then there's all these arguments, and then you wear a MAGA hat, [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4631.0s)]
*  and then your wife wears red when she votes. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4635.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4638.0s)]
*  Like, ehh. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4639.0s)]
*  Yeah, you send the signal. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4640.0s)]
*  And then your wife gives a speech where she's mocking Kamala Harris. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4641.0s)]
*  She's talking about joy, and like, just nonsensical fucking word salad. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4645.0s)]
*  Dude, I know. I saw that. It's like, they're so pissed. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4651.0s)]
*  It's kind of a coup. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4654.0s)]
*  It seems like it's kind of a coup. And also, the right thing to do. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4655.0s)]
*  That guy should not be- he might have won. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4659.0s)]
*  I mean, it was the right thing to do in terms of, like, you can't have a guy who's just a figurehead. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4662.0s)]
*  That's not what the deal is. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4668.0s)]
*  The deal is, this guy is going to be doing his best to look out for us, [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4670.0s)]
*  and to make sure that he navigates this world of finance and environment and international relations [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4675.0s)]
*  perfectly where he doesn't blow anything up, and he makes our economy happier. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4681.0s)]
*  Go. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4684.0s)]
*  Go. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4685.0s)]
*  That's the deal. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4686.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, but again, like- [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4687.0s)]
*  You can't, like, have only a mask. Like, who's running the deal? [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4690.0s)]
*  Well, that was- okay. So again, it's like, and this is the fantasy of any hippie or whatever. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4694.0s)]
*  So the idea is, predicted in the New Age movement, and I think you would argue in a lot of religions, [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4699.0s)]
*  is the consciousness shift is happening. The Age of Aquarius, whatever the fuck you want to call it. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4708.0s)]
*  Consciousness shift. And so, the idea is that what we're witnessing is essentially the collapse [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4713.0s)]
*  of a way of doing things that is collapsing, and as it collapses, it starts making big mistakes. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4723.0s)]
*  One big mistake would be people figure out that we have had a president who is basically incapacitated, [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4731.0s)]
*  meaning we don't really need a president. The whole model starts falling apart. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4742.0s)]
*  Also, when you realize, like, if you watch basketball, or skateboarding, [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4748.0s)]
*  watch skateboarding now versus skateboarding when people started skateboarding. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4756.0s)]
*  Like, the tricks people are doing now versus what they used to do, right? [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4761.0s)]
*  And you see how quickly people, when something's fun or important, how quickly it evolves, right? [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4765.0s)]
*  So, the coup is problematic in that, again, you know a coup has happened. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4770.0s)]
*  The ultimate coup is to have a figurehead. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4776.0s)]
*  Now, you know, it's a hacky trope, I guess, the idea being that, like, every president is just a fucking puppet, right? [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4782.0s)]
*  But the problem with that puppet is that, like, these are puppets who actually do have power. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4791.0s)]
*  They will make decisions, even if there's a lot of pressure from God knows whatever the web of unknown people is [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4797.0s)]
*  to, like, grab the steering wheel, they can say no. So that's a problem. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4803.0s)]
*  So, if I want to control the steering wheel completely, dude, what's better than an old man who has dementia? [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4808.0s)]
*  Because I could tell him shit happened that didn't happen. I could show him news sources that aren't even real. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4818.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? I could literally, like, just... [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4824.0s)]
*  He probably pretends to be able to read. His eyes are probably gone. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4827.0s)]
*  Dude, absolutely. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4830.0s)]
*  Probably pretends. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4831.0s)]
*  Absolutely. And then the other side of it, aside from it's a coup, it's completely unconstitutional, [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4832.0s)]
*  it's a fucked up takeover of the US government, if you just look at the abuse of, like, the right thing to do [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4840.0s)]
*  when you have a president, a bus driver, whoever who's got senile dementia, is to say, [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4849.0s)]
*  is to say, hey, guys, he's really sick and he can't do the job anymore. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4856.0s)]
*  And we have to find somebody else to do the job now. That's the right thing to do. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4861.0s)]
*  But these motherfuckers are like, no, no, no, no, no, no, we'll lose our jobs. We're in the fucking cabinet. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4866.0s)]
*  Exactly. They're like, we don't want a primary because if another Democrat comes in, [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4871.0s)]
*  if Shapiro comes in, if Newsom comes in, whole new cabinet. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4875.0s)]
*  That's right. That's right. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4878.0s)]
*  Everybody knew. Everybody knew. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4879.0s)]
*  That's it. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4880.0s)]
*  Everybody wants to keep their job. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4881.0s)]
*  It's so fucked up. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4882.0s)]
*  Even if you are sad that Trump won and you wish Kamala Harris won, [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4883.0s)]
*  if she did win, it would be the first time that anybody won without winning a primary. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4889.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4895.0s)]
*  And that's kind of crazy. And it's not a good precedent to set. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4896.0s)]
*  It's not good to let people weasel around this system that we have in place. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4898.0s)]
*  And by having a vice president and then immediately appointing them as the Democratic candidate, [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4904.0s)]
*  that's kind of illegal. It seems like it's kind of illegal. Is it illegal? [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4909.0s)]
*  Well, dude, I mean, should it be illegal? How about let me say this. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4913.0s)]
*  That should be illegal. Right. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4917.0s)]
*  You should have to have a vote from the people to decide who their Democratic elected person who's going to run for president is. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4918.0s)]
*  Right. That's the whole deal. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4926.0s)]
*  Yeah. Maybe people didn't vote for you when you were running for president, which is a fact. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4929.0s)]
*  And so then when you ran for vice president or when he chose you as vice president, [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4935.0s)]
*  all of a sudden we're supposed to pretend that you're a really good candidate for president. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4939.0s)]
*  Let's find out what the people think. If you guys believe that she's the best person for the job, [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4943.0s)]
*  the whole idea is supposed to be sell it and then people vote. Like really vote. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4949.0s)]
*  Actually vote. Don't fuck with the vote. Yeah. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4954.0s)]
*  The mail-in ballots seem kind of odd. Let's not do that. Yeah. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4956.0s)]
*  Nixon was talking about how they could be rigged in the 70s. Yeah. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4960.0s)]
*  Let's just do it in person like we always do. That's right, man. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4963.0s)]
*  Let's just vote. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4966.0s)]
*  The idea is like if I'm a kidnapper and I kidnap you and I, I don't know, knock you out or something, [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4967.0s)]
*  you come to and I explain we're married, I need to pull that off. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4975.0s)]
*  We're now married. I've just kidnapped somebody, but now they think that we're married. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4979.0s)]
*  What I'm saying is, you know, if you're gaslighting, you really need to execute perfectly gaslighting. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4983.0s)]
*  And so the problem with, and I think this is the buried fucking headline in the drones, in the Kamala coup, [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=4992.0s)]
*  the president with senile dementia, is that all of these actions taken by the federal government [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5001.0s)]
*  have not just corroded people's trust in the federal government, but potentially like annihilated it. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5010.0s)]
*  Like dilated it. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5018.0s)]
*  Meaning now, you know, if I'm kidnapped by somebody and they're like, no, here's why I kidnapped you. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5019.0s)]
*  Oh God, there's that great movie where like somebody ends up in someone's survival bunker [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5024.0s)]
*  and you wonder, is it really the end of the world or is this person kidnapped? [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5029.0s)]
*  He's saying, you can't go out there. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5032.0s)]
*  But it's like the idea is the moment if I've been kidnapped and I actually buy into your shit, [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5034.0s)]
*  that's going to create a lot less anxiety for me. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5040.0s)]
*  But the moment your kidnappy stops believing you, whoa, that's not fun for anybody. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5043.0s)]
*  And right now I feel like that's the general mood is people just don't trust. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5051.0s)]
*  And the people that do have Stockholm syndrome. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5057.0s)]
*  That's it, dude. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5059.0s)]
*  That's it. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5060.0s)]
*  That's it. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5061.0s)]
*  That's it. Those are the people that are still getting boosted. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5062.0s)]
*  I am up to date. I have all nine of my boosters. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5064.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5067.0s)]
*  They've got boosters in their eyeballs. You can see them swimming around behind their eyeballs. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5068.0s)]
*  Eventually they're going to be just pointing at you. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5071.0s)]
*  You haven't had your boosters. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5075.0s)]
*  That is... [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5076.0s)]
*  Six feet distance. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5082.0s)]
*  That's what it felt like, man. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5083.0s)]
*  That's what it felt like being unvaccinated in the pandemic. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5084.0s)]
*  Well, it felt like some people looked at you like you were the dirty. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5087.0s)]
*  Like I heard dudes I know. I know them. I've hung out with them. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5091.0s)]
*  And they were calling people plague rats. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5097.0s)]
*  Plague rats. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5099.0s)]
*  And unvaccinated people plague rats. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5100.0s)]
*  Listen, this is... [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5102.0s)]
*  And maybe you're not supposed to do this. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5105.0s)]
*  Like when you're saying you try to find the compassionate way of looking at Kamala Harris. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5107.0s)]
*  I try to find that with everybody, man. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5111.0s)]
*  That as like an exercise that I've been doing more and more over the last few years. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5114.0s)]
*  I try to push it all day long. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5120.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5123.0s)]
*  There's so many things to get upset about. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5124.0s)]
*  But there's also... [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5126.0s)]
*  There's so many good things in the world too. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5129.0s)]
*  And we can't fall into the... [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5131.0s)]
*  We're not designed to soak up 8 billion people worth of bad news. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5133.0s)]
*  That's right. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5137.0s)]
*  We're just not designed that way. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5138.0s)]
*  That's right. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5139.0s)]
*  And if you suck all that stuff in, you're going to have a lot of negativity in your life. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5140.0s)]
*  And it's not about forgiving people. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5146.0s)]
*  For like even like CNN people that are spitting out propaganda. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5148.0s)]
*  Like your demise is self-created. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5152.0s)]
*  You will be punished by your own doings. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5155.0s)]
*  That's right. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5157.0s)]
*  The world has responded to all... [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5158.0s)]
*  Have you seen this crazy interviewer, Don Lemon, interview some dude on the street? [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5160.0s)]
*  No. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5164.0s)]
*  You haven't seen this? [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5165.0s)]
*  No. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5166.0s)]
*  It's so funny because Don Lemon's doing like these on the street interviews. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5167.0s)]
*  And he's talking to this guy about the news. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5170.0s)]
*  And the guy is essentially telling Don Lemon, like, I don't trust all these sources you're saying. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5174.0s)]
*  He's like, look, here it is, Washington Post. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5179.0s)]
*  I forget what the subject was, but he got Don Lemon to say, I don't listen to mainstream news either. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5181.0s)]
*  What? [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5189.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5190.0s)]
*  Play this. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5191.0s)]
*  Play this from the beginning. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5192.0s)]
*  Because this is so crazy. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5193.0s)]
*  Who is the real president-elect, do you think? [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5195.0s)]
*  Donald Trump, I believe. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5200.0s)]
*  Democratic lawmakers in Washington are calling Elon Musk president. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5202.0s)]
*  They're saying Donald Trump is the vice president or the head of communications. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5205.0s)]
*  What, what, what, wait a second. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5209.0s)]
*  No, no one said that. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5210.0s)]
*  Really? [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5211.0s)]
*  Have you not watched and paid attention to the news? [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5212.0s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5214.0s)]
*  I'm paying attention to what I'm doing during my day so I can try and get a better life. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5215.0s)]
*  Okay, do you have your phone with you? [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5217.0s)]
*  I do. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5219.0s)]
*  Why don't you Google right now, President Musk can see what comes up. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5220.0s)]
*  No, but that's already a loaded question, do you realize? [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5223.0s)]
*  Tell me, give me the sources. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5225.0s)]
*  Axios, Business Insider. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5226.0s)]
*  We don't trust any of these. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5228.0s)]
*  The common man doesn't trust any of this. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5229.0s)]
*  ABC News, Washington Post. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5231.0s)]
*  So what? [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5233.0s)]
*  The Atlantic. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5234.0s)]
*  I don't trust any of these. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5235.0s)]
*  I don't trust any of them. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5236.0s)]
*  I don't trust any of these. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5238.0s)]
*  We're the common man. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5239.0s)]
*  We don't trust any of these. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5240.0s)]
*  No one trusts the government. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5241.0s)]
*  No one trusts the common news. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5243.0s)]
*  We don't trust any of that anymore. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5245.0s)]
*  Independent News, we are the ones that own the news now. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5246.0s)]
*  People trust me. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5249.0s)]
*  They don't trust MSNBC because I care about actually one of them. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5250.0s)]
*  I can't disagree with you. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5254.0s)]
*  Okay. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5255.0s)]
*  Well then. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5256.0s)]
*  A lot of people come to me saying I only watch, I don't watch corporate media anymore. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5257.0s)]
*  Oh, he said a lot of people coming to him. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5261.0s)]
*  I misunderstood. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5263.0s)]
*  I got a heart on when I saw that. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5264.0s)]
*  Dude, that is incredible. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5265.0s)]
*  Well that guy just geniusly broke down this illogical assumption that because it's on [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5268.0s)]
*  these accepted sources it must be true. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5274.0s)]
*  Like oh, he's President Musk. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5277.0s)]
*  Maybe we have the good guy super genius on our side. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5279.0s)]
*  And this idea that he's doing it for money, hey you fucking half wits, he has all the [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5283.0s)]
*  money. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5289.0s)]
*  He has more money than anybody. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5290.0s)]
*  He's simultaneously running multiple businesses that are at the peak, the cutting edge of [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5292.0s)]
*  technology. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5298.0s)]
*  Shut the fuck up and let him cook. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5299.0s)]
*  Let him cook. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5302.0s)]
*  Also though, when you realize, this is like, when the DNC starts astroturfing Reddit, when [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5303.0s)]
*  the DNC starts astroturfing 4chan, when the DNC started doing that using all that fucking [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5313.0s)]
*  money. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5318.0s)]
*  And it's so funny because the astroturfing, after she lost it just stopped. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5319.0s)]
*  Explain astroturfing to people. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5323.0s)]
*  So the idea is like I infiltrate message boards, post political messages disguised as like [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5324.0s)]
*  somebody just putting a post up. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5331.0s)]
*  I try to redirect the conversation or essentially imply a consensus that doesn't exist. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5333.0s)]
*  And so there's ways of manipulating the algorithm. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5340.0s)]
*  The algorithm apparently on the DNC's Discord server, they were talking about the best ways [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5343.0s)]
*  and times to post on Reddit to attempt to move the fucking needle. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5348.0s)]
*  It's kind of amazing, isn't it? [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5352.0s)]
*  It should be illegal. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5354.0s)]
*  It's so fucked up. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5356.0s)]
*  Full-blown propaganda. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5358.0s)]
*  If we, I don't know, we did a renegade rogue commercial for nicotine pouches on Instagram, [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5360.0s)]
*  you have to say this is a sponsored post. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5366.0s)]
*  So why is it that if you work for the DNC or volunteer for any state entity, you don't [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5368.0s)]
*  have to say also I'm doing this as a volunteer for the DNC. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5374.0s)]
*  That's why I posted this. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5378.0s)]
*  You don't have to do that. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5379.0s)]
*  So that's invasion of the body snatchers. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5380.0s)]
*  That's the, I'm pretending to be a normal person. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5383.0s)]
*  I'm infecting the data sphere with propaganda. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5387.0s)]
*  And if I do it enough, it will create the illusion that this is the consensus. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5391.0s)]
*  And the reason you want to create that illusion is because people like to sync up. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5397.0s)]
*  That's what they know. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5402.0s)]
*  They love to sync up. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5403.0s)]
*  And really smart people like to get really good at syncing up. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5404.0s)]
*  They like to get really good at it and really good at correcting others who don't sync up correctly. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5408.0s)]
*  There you go. Sync up. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5412.0s)]
*  And you know what it is? [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5414.0s)]
*  It's just dorks. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5415.0s)]
*  It's dorks. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5416.0s)]
*  And dorks have found a thing. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5417.0s)]
*  They found a thing. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5419.0s)]
*  Maybe your thing could have been chess. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5420.0s)]
*  It's not. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5421.0s)]
*  It's politics. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5422.0s)]
*  Maybe, you know what I mean? [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5423.0s)]
*  Like whatever your thing is, that's what's really going on. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5424.0s)]
*  And your denial of objective reality in order to win, it exposes you. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5428.0s)]
*  It exposes you to people in this new world that are recognizing that we are the only people that have ever gone through this. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5435.0s)]
*  And we are in this insane moment of realization about how much we've been bullshitted and manipulated in the past. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5446.0s)]
*  How much of all of our resources are going to things that we would never agree to. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5456.0s)]
*  And how much of this chaos is being pushed upon us by people who are profiting from it in a fucking spectacular way that's almost indescribable. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5462.0s)]
*  Insane amounts of money in control of the narrative. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5475.0s)]
*  And it's not working. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5479.0s)]
*  It's still not working. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5481.0s)]
*  It's not working. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5482.0s)]
*  It's not working. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5483.0s)]
*  You and I and Jamie in a fucking room are working. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5484.0s)]
*  That's not working. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5491.0s)]
*  What they're doing is not working because people are getting information from multiple sources now. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5492.0s)]
*  And the sources that aren't reliable, like that guy listed off, they're dying off. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5498.0s)]
*  They're dying off. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5503.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5504.0s)]
*  You know, the New York Times app is more people use it for Wordle than anything. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5505.0s)]
*  Like New York Times has essentially become a gaming company. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5509.0s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5511.0s)]
*  See if that's true. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5512.0s)]
*  I don't want to get sued. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5513.0s)]
*  I'm pretty sure it's true. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5514.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, Wordle is fun. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5515.0s)]
*  I'm sure it's fun. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5517.0s)]
*  I think it's a separate app. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5518.0s)]
*  Is it a separate app? [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5519.0s)]
*  Pretty sure. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5520.0s)]
*  Or is it that Wordle gets... [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5521.0s)]
*  Do you mind if I do more of this? [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5522.0s)]
*  I do mind. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5523.0s)]
*  I'm tired of you drinking. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5524.0s)]
*  No, thank you. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5525.0s)]
*  I'm kidding. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5526.0s)]
*  Is that what it is? [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5527.0s)]
*  That's probably that. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5528.0s)]
*  So that Wordle gets more activity for the company. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5529.0s)]
*  That's what essentially... [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5532.0s)]
*  Yeah, there was a graph. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5533.0s)]
*  I was too lazy to read the whole graph. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5534.0s)]
*  But it was breaking down how Wordle is more used than anything. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5536.0s)]
*  Well, listen, this is... [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5540.0s)]
*  Is it true? [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5541.0s)]
*  Let's make sure that's true. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5542.0s)]
*  Otherwise, we'll have to cut this out. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5543.0s)]
*  I don't want New York Times on my ass. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5544.0s)]
*  Oh my God, that would suck. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5546.0s)]
*  It sucks so bad. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5548.0s)]
*  They've done it before. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5550.0s)]
*  It's just... [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5551.0s)]
*  That's their job. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5552.0s)]
*  That's their job. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5553.0s)]
*  You know, they're just like... [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5554.0s)]
*  That shouldn't be a job where your... [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5556.0s)]
*  There you go. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5559.0s)]
*  New York Times games are more popular than it's news. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5560.0s)]
*  If that's what you want it to be, but here's the thing. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5563.0s)]
*  It's not necessary anymore. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5566.0s)]
*  And I think that through the rise of independent journalism, one of the things we're realizing [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5568.0s)]
*  is that all someone has to do is be consistently objective and intelligent and post things [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5573.0s)]
*  and post takes on things, like Coleman Hughes or some of these people. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5581.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5584.0s)]
*  Consistently intelligent, objective, and then you'll develop a following. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5585.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5588.0s)]
*  And then you'll become a reliable source of news. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5589.0s)]
*  That's right. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5591.0s)]
*  Because I know that if I ask Coleman about X, Y, or Z, and he's informed, he's going [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5592.0s)]
*  to give me a very intelligent breakdown of what it is. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5597.0s)]
*  There's a few people in my life that are like, like Andrew Huberman, if they have some sort [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5600.0s)]
*  of health-related question, Peter Atiyah. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5604.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5606.0s)]
*  Some sort of like, how are they doing this? [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5607.0s)]
*  Is this legitimate? [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5609.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5610.0s)]
*  And they'll look at it and they'll analyze it. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5611.0s)]
*  I've sent Huberman stuff and he goes over the data. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5613.0s)]
*  He's like, this is fascinating. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5616.0s)]
*  This theoretically should work, and then this will explain why and what the pathways are [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5617.0s)]
*  and how interesting this is. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5622.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5624.0s)]
*  It's an amazing resource that wasn't available before to any person. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5625.0s)]
*  Forget, I mean, it's too difficult. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5630.0s)]
*  You'd have one line of inquiry. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5632.0s)]
*  Like, you have one lane, whether it's archeology or language, one lane where you look super [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5635.0s)]
*  well-read in. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5640.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5641.0s)]
*  You don't have access to all these other professors that are working on quantum physics. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5642.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5645.0s)]
*  You don't have access to the James Webb Telescope. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5646.0s)]
*  You don't have access to all this data. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5648.0s)]
*  It's too hard to get. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5650.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5651.0s)]
*  Now it's fucking everywhere. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5652.0s)]
*  Everywhere. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5653.0s)]
*  It's everywhere all the time. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5654.0s)]
*  That's right. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5656.0s)]
*  It's a question away on your phone. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5657.0s)]
*  It's a question away. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5659.0s)]
*  You pick up your phone and you just fucking press a button. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5660.0s)]
*  You say, hey Google, why don't you tell me what the James Webb Telescope's been up to? [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5663.0s)]
*  ChatGPD. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5667.0s)]
*  Yeah, hey ChatGPD, why don't you talk to me like Santa Claus and explain to me why these [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5668.0s)]
*  drones are fake? [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5671.0s)]
*  The best. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5673.0s)]
*  It's the best. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5675.0s)]
*  Dude, I don't know if the drones are China's or ours or water people. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5676.0s)]
*  They're coming out of the water. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5682.0s)]
*  No telling. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5684.0s)]
*  Imagine if there's a civilization under the water. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5685.0s)]
*  That's where I would hide if I was trying to hide from a civilization. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5687.0s)]
*  It's the ocean. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5690.0s)]
*  It's clear. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5691.0s)]
*  They can't get in there. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5692.0s)]
*  They can't breathe under there. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5693.0s)]
*  It's the perfect place to hide. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5694.0s)]
*  You know what I've been saying for a while, the last few weeks at least? [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5695.0s)]
*  I think maybe what the aliens are is custodians. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5697.0s)]
*  I think maybe they're just here, they're like some sort of autonomous creation that's designed [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5702.0s)]
*  to accelerate our evolution, stop us from blowing ourselves up, and make sure that we [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5710.0s)]
*  build a quantum computer with AI. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5716.16s)]
*  This is like, it's all a part of this endless cycle of integration in the great universe. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5720.0s)]
*  We're at this like, oh I don't want to get out of my cocoon. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5727.0s)]
*  We're in that stage. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5730.0s)]
*  We're in this like bizarre, strange, Australia Pythagoras wandering around in the grass fields. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5731.0s)]
*  We're in this weird stage where we're going to launch into some completely new way of [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5738.0s)]
*  interfacing with the universe itself. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5745.0s)]
*  And it's going to happen, whether you like it or not. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5748.0s)]
*  And this is just what's happening right now, and that's why everything's so chaotic. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5751.0s)]
*  Like McKenna used to talk about this. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5755.0s)]
*  He used to talk about how the end of civilization, it's not going to be a whimper. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5757.0s)]
*  It's going to be people screaming and agony and flailing and trying to hold on to the past. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5760.0s)]
*  Hold on to the way! [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5766.0s)]
*  Hold on to Norman Rockwell paintings. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5767.0s)]
*  I want to bake my own fucking bread. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5769.0s)]
*  You're trying to do a waltz at a rave. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5771.0s)]
*  How many fucking genders? [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5773.0s)]
*  What are you saying? [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5774.0s)]
*  Why are these fucking drones, they're drones goddammit! [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5776.0s)]
*  It's the meltdown. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5779.0s)]
*  And you know, if you, what you're saying, like so if you look at like Crick and, I think [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5780.0s)]
*  it was Crick wrote the, he wrote a paper theorizing about directed panspermia, which is where [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5785.0s)]
*  you put it. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5793.0s)]
*  So, so okay, directed panspermia, I get some kind of nanobot, which is, I guess you could [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5794.0s)]
*  say that's what DNA is, nanobot precursor, essentially like, well I think it's weird. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5799.0s)]
*  And maybe I don't understand what he's doing completely. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5805.0s)]
*  It's weird to me that Musk wants to send humans to Mars, because it seems like it would make [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5807.0s)]
*  way more sense, pre-sending humans to send drones, robots, to construct whatever it is [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5812.0s)]
*  you need to survive on Mars, to go in the caves, build the fucking... [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5820.0s)]
*  Well that's the plan, Duncan. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5824.0s)]
*  Oh, really? [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5825.0s)]
*  So it's not people first? [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5826.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, the first voyage to Mars is going to be unmanned. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5827.0s)]
*  Okay, great. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5830.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5831.0s)]
*  I think they have to do that. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5832.0s)]
*  They have to have a certain amount of supplies, because I think they can only come back in [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5833.0s)]
*  two years. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5836.0s)]
*  But I don't even mean supplies. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5837.0s)]
*  I mean, if we jump for 20 years... [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5838.0s)]
*  I'm missing that bus. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5841.0s)]
*  The Mars bus? [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5842.0s)]
*  The two-year bus? [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5843.0s)]
*  Oh, Duncan, you were late. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5844.0s)]
*  You slept in. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5846.0s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5847.0s)]
*  Yeah, you missed the bus. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5848.0s)]
*  You watched the rocket go up. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5849.0s)]
*  No. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5851.0s)]
*  No, nobody woke me. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5852.0s)]
*  You cocksuckers. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5854.0s)]
*  It's fucking hilarious. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5855.0s)]
*  Imagine if you're like, Duncan is such a fucking douchebag. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5856.0s)]
*  Let's leave him here. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5858.0s)]
*  Let's leave him on Mars. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5859.0s)]
*  There's plenty of potatoes. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5860.0s)]
*  He can live. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5861.0s)]
*  That is so fucked up. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5862.0s)]
*  Let's leave him here. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5863.0s)]
*  Fuck him. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5864.0s)]
*  Make him fertilize his potatoes with his own shit like... [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5865.0s)]
*  So, Damon. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5868.0s)]
*  Yeah, like Matt Damon did. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5869.0s)]
*  Like Matt Damon did in that Marsha movie. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5870.0s)]
*  Dude, so... [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5873.0s)]
*  So, obviously, the way you're going to want to colonize habitable worlds is you create [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5874.0s)]
*  not just this nanobot, but you make it so the nanobot can only survive in environments [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5883.0s)]
*  that you would live in. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5887.0s)]
*  Meaning, and then encoded in the nanobot is the end destination, what you're talking about. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5888.0s)]
*  The quantum computer is some kind of AI that then will naturally uncover faster than light [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5893.52s)]
*  And then when the wormholes open up, you can instantaneously travel to habitable planets. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5899.56s)]
*  Can I tell you Terrence Howard's idea? [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5905.56s)]
*  It's a great idea. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5908.56s)]
*  He thinks that we have it all wrong when it comes to the formation of planets and the [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5910.56s)]
*  creation of life. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5916.56s)]
*  He thinks what happens is the sun is constantly ejecting things. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5918.56s)]
*  You see these coronal mass ejections. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5923.56s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5926.56s)]
*  Millions of times longer than the distance between whatever and whatever. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5927.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5933.56s)]
*  Just scary. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5934.56s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5935.56s)]
*  Bigger than Earth. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5936.56s)]
*  Right? [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5937.56s)]
*  That he thinks these particles coalesce in space outside of the gravity of the sun, and [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5938.56s)]
*  they orbit the sun, and very close at first. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5943.56s)]
*  But then as time goes on, they move further and further away. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5946.56s)]
*  And they get to a place where they're in this position like Earth is, and then they people. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5949.56s)]
*  They flower, just like when you plant a seed, when the water comes. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5954.56s)]
*  So cool. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5959.56s)]
*  And then it has to be sophisticated enough to adapt because the planet is eventually [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5960.56s)]
*  going to move out of the habitable zone. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5966.56s)]
*  Wow. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5968.56s)]
*  He thinks that Mars at one point in time probably had civilization and life. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5969.56s)]
*  And then as Mars got further and further and further out from the protection of the sun, [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5975.56s)]
*  it eventually got too cold, and it eventually got hit by something. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5980.56s)]
*  It lost its atmosphere, and now it's just desert. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5983.56s)]
*  That's so cool. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5986.56s)]
*  Well, now they know there's water on Mars. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5987.56s)]
*  They know. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5989.56s)]
*  It used to be just the craziest of conspiracy theories. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5990.56s)]
*  Oh, there's no water on Mars. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5992.56s)]
*  There's no evidence of water. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5994.56s)]
*  How could a society live there? [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5996.56s)]
*  But this is the nuttiest of nutty. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=5998.56s)]
*  But some remote viewer went to Mars a million years ago and said there were pyramids there, [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6001.56s)]
*  and there was a civilization there. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6007.56s)]
*  And you know, there's tribes. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6009.56s)]
*  Actually, they think they came from the planet Sirius, right, like the Dogon tribe. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6012.56s)]
*  They believe that all people came from another planet. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6016.56s)]
*  If you were in Mars and you're a thousand years advanced from us and they never figure out AI, [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6020.56s)]
*  so they could just go in a different direction, they're like super, super advanced though, [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6026.56s)]
*  where they could travel through the space between the planets. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6029.56s)]
*  And you get to a point where you're like, hey guys, we've got about a decade. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6032.56s)]
*  We've got about one decade where life can exist on this fucking planet. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6037.56s)]
*  We've got to get off of this now. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6041.56s)]
*  Earth is ready. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6043.56s)]
*  There's some monkeys there. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6045.56s)]
*  There's a bunch of shit there. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6047.56s)]
*  It's like, you know, we could just go there. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6049.56s)]
*  We should just go there. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6051.56s)]
*  And then we just munked around with them. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6053.56s)]
*  These guys are developing really slowly. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6055.56s)]
*  And then homo sapiens. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6057.56s)]
*  Yay, look, homo sapiens. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6059.56s)]
*  Man, listen, whatever it is, I'm sure... [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6061.56s)]
*  It's definitely not what I just described. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6064.56s)]
*  Whatever it is, it's not bad. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6066.56s)]
*  I wasn't believing it as I was saying it. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6068.56s)]
*  I was like, that's crazy. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6070.56s)]
*  But dude, you know, I think you look at just the concept of epigenetics [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6071.56s)]
*  and what we're doing right now, [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6077.56s)]
*  you look at the statistical probability of DNA evolving based on the age of the planet. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6079.56s)]
*  You look at these things and not just that, you look at the mythologies of the world. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6085.56s)]
*  It all points towards some kind of advanced intelligence, [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6089.56s)]
*  bioengineering a planet for some reason or another. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6095.56s)]
*  I mean, even like, have you ever read the parable of the sower? [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6099.56s)]
*  You know that? Jesus said... [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6102.56s)]
*  Do you mind pulling that up, Jamie? [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6105.56s)]
*  I don't have it memorized yet. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6107.56s)]
*  The parable of the sower? [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6109.56s)]
*  How do you spell sower? [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6111.56s)]
*  Sower, S-O-W-E-R. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6113.56s)]
*  Oh, like a sow? Like sowing things? [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6115.56s)]
*  No, like planting seeds. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6117.56s)]
*  S-O, sower of seeds. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6118.56s)]
*  The parable of the sower. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6120.56s)]
*  But when you think about this, generally this is the idea of like, [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6122.56s)]
*  people are going to understand Jesus as God, [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6125.56s)]
*  but if you look at it as an extraterrestrial intelligence, [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6128.56s)]
*  planting seeds on planets versus... [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6131.56s)]
*  It becomes this like crazy... [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6134.56s)]
*  The sower is the... [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6137.56s)]
*  Yeah, the parable of the sower. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6139.56s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6142.56s)]
*  Though seeing, they do not see. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6144.56s)]
*  Though hearing, they do not hear or understand. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6146.56s)]
*  And then, where is it? [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6149.56s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6151.56s)]
*  And he told... [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6153.56s)]
*  A farmer went out to sow his seed. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6155.56s)]
*  As he was scattering the seeds, some fell along the path, [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6157.56s)]
*  and the birds ate it up. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6159.56s)]
*  Some fell on rocky places where it did not have much soil. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6161.56s)]
*  It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6163.56s)]
*  But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6166.56s)]
*  and they withered because they had no root. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6168.56s)]
*  Other seeds fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6170.56s)]
*  Still, other seed fell on good soil where it produced a crop, [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6173.56s)]
*  160 or 30 times what was sown. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6176.56s)]
*  Whoever has ears, let them hear. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6179.56s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6181.56s)]
*  Listen to this. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6184.56s)]
*  The disciples came to him and asked, [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6186.56s)]
*  why do you speak to the people in parables? [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6188.56s)]
*  He replied, because the knowledge of the secrets of the Kingdom of Heaven [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6190.56s)]
*  has been given to you, but not to them. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6194.56s)]
*  Whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6197.56s)]
*  Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6202.56s)]
*  This is why I speak to them in parables. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6206.56s)]
*  I'd be like, bro, what the fuck did you just say? [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6208.56s)]
*  Can you break that down? [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6210.56s)]
*  If I had that guy on the podcast, if I had God on the podcast, [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6212.56s)]
*  I'd be like, okay, do you have friends? [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6214.56s)]
*  Okay, when you talk to friends, like, you should, [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6217.56s)]
*  when you say, like, complicated things, you should make them make sense. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6219.56s)]
*  So I know you're smart. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6223.56s)]
*  You made the whole universe. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6225.56s)]
*  I'm not being disrespectful, sir. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6227.56s)]
*  But what did you just say? [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6229.56s)]
*  Well, let me answer it in a parable. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6231.56s)]
*  You see, imagine a flower growing from stone. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6233.56s)]
*  Sometimes the stone is angry at the flower, [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6237.56s)]
*  but sometimes the stone glows with light. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6240.56s)]
*  This is why. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6243.56s)]
*  Is it because we teach kids that way, kind of? [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6245.56s)]
*  We kind of teach kids almost in parables. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6250.56s)]
*  We teach kids like a simplistic form of everything. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6253.56s)]
*  Well, I think it's an acknowledgement of a kind of spectrum of intelligence, right? [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6258.56s)]
*  It's like the idea is like, let me give you a little data fractal here. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6263.56s)]
*  That's why it's so rude when someone talks down to you. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6267.56s)]
*  Oh, the worst. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6269.56s)]
*  When someone's like, I don't know if you know, but let me explain to you. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6271.56s)]
*  Oh, please. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6275.56s)]
*  What's wrong with the way you're thinking. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6276.56s)]
*  I can't wait to hear. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6278.56s)]
*  It's the grossest way to talk to people ever. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6279.56s)]
*  It is. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6281.56s)]
*  It's absolutely a sign of low intelligence if you're so idiotic that you think. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6282.56s)]
*  And you'd be mean. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6287.56s)]
*  Yeah, but how do you feel? [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6288.56s)]
*  But you're deciding to be mean about a point of discussion. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6289.56s)]
*  That's right. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6295.56s)]
*  That's what it is. You're deciding to be mean. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6296.56s)]
*  Instead of saying, I have a lot of knowledge about this, if I could tell you what I know. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6297.56s)]
*  This is why I believe what you're saying is not true. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6304.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6307.56s)]
*  Because I actually have a PhD in this, and this is how we know this, and this is how we know that. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6308.56s)]
*  And then you go, oh, that's essentially what Eric Weinstein did to Terrence Howard. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6312.56s)]
*  So when Terrence Howard was on the podcast, there was a lot of things that you're saying that were true and really fascinating and very interesting. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6316.56s)]
*  He's a very brilliant guy. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6321.56s)]
*  Eric Weinstein is a legitimate PhD in mathematics. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6323.56s)]
*  He's super fucking crazy, scary smart. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6326.56s)]
*  And he said to him, he said, look, I'm not giving you peer review. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6329.56s)]
*  He goes, I'm not a peer. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6332.56s)]
*  You're not my peer. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6334.56s)]
*  He goes, I'm an expert. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6335.56s)]
*  I'm giving you an expert review. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6336.56s)]
*  I'm saying you have a lot of really interesting ideas. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6337.56s)]
*  Just stop teaching people. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6339.56s)]
*  It's offensive to the people that actually do this for a living. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6341.56s)]
*  That's all it is. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6344.56s)]
*  It doesn't, you are like us. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6345.56s)]
*  And this is what he said of him. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6347.56s)]
*  He said he's one of us. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6348.56s)]
*  He just went down a different path. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6349.56s)]
*  That's right. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6350.56s)]
*  He's a brilliant guy who has a strong desire to understand the universe. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6351.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6356.56s)]
*  Strong desire to understand things. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6357.56s)]
*  But he's not, you have to go down the path of peers. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6358.56s)]
*  You have to go down the path of you got to be with all these other legitimate people to bounce these ideas about. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6362.56s)]
*  And the only way you're really going to get in, you have to find some online community of legitimate people that accept you. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6367.56s)]
*  You have to be invited into something or you have to fucking attend a university like all the other ones did. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6373.56s)]
*  That's right. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6377.56s)]
*  That's that's how you find out, especially when it comes to shit like mathematics. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6378.56s)]
*  Boy, you know, when you're talking about like things like physics. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6382.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6385.56s)]
*  Boy, you need that's these are cold, hard, fact based disciplines. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6386.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6391.56s)]
*  You need to be around the people that are the cream of the crop of that. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6392.56s)]
*  That's it. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6394.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6395.56s)]
*  That's right, man. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6396.56s)]
*  That I watched some of that and I loved it because, well, that's what compassion looks like. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6397.56s)]
*  You got to see also that Terrence is a good guy. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6407.56s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6409.56s)]
*  He didn't get upset. He didn't get angry. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6410.56s)]
*  Yeah, it wasn't designed to humiliate. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6411.56s)]
*  It wasn't at all. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6413.56s)]
*  And it was also an acknowledgement that a lot of his ideas are really fucking good. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6414.56s)]
*  That peopling idea is really fucking good. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6417.56s)]
*  The other thing that he has that he invented. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6420.56s)]
*  You've seen that linchpin thing that he invented. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6422.56s)]
*  I saw something like that. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6424.56s)]
*  It's like modular drone technology. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6425.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6427.56s)]
*  That can be used for construction and fucking moving giant girders and shit. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6428.56s)]
*  Creative vortex or something. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6432.56s)]
*  Well, they all link together. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6433.56s)]
*  It's like a geometric pattern. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6435.56s)]
*  But the nerdiest of nerdy things was Weinstein calling him out on the degree of the angle of one of the fucking calculations that he made. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6436.56s)]
*  I don't even remember exactly what it was. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6447.56s)]
*  He was, you had to cheat that, right? [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6449.56s)]
*  Right. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6450.56s)]
*  And he's like, yeah, I did. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6451.56s)]
*  I did that to make it work. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6452.56s)]
*  And he's like, ah. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6453.56s)]
*  And they were like fucking with each other because he understood why there would be something problematic about linking all these specific geometric patterns. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6454.56s)]
*  And then he had to make some slight adjustment to make them link up perfectly. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6462.56s)]
*  I love that. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6465.56s)]
*  Super nerd talk. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6466.56s)]
*  Inside baseball, comedians do it too. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6467.56s)]
*  Right. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6469.56s)]
*  When we're breaking down a joke to a minute pause or something. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6470.56s)]
*  It's the same thing. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6475.56s)]
*  But yeah, man, I mean, this this was this is what I love when you read about the history of science. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6477.56s)]
*  You read about like famous physicists getting in real, like intense fights with each other. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6483.56s)]
*  And you see that the process of discovering the truth does involve a kind of mutual curiosity, but not being afraid to say this is fucking wrong, but allowing the other person to fire back. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6491.56s)]
*  Because you both know that via this conflict, potentially you discover something new. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6506.56s)]
*  And that that was the attitude. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6511.56s)]
*  I mean, like this whole thing where suddenly normal people aren't supposed to engage in science is really fucked up when you look at like the history of science, which used to be maniacs like Newton, who they analyzed his hair, mercury in his fucking hair. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6513.56s)]
*  Bro, everything had poisoned it back then. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6534.56s)]
*  Well, no, but he was experimenting with mercury. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6536.56s)]
*  He was interested. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6538.56s)]
*  He's like building scale replicas of the Temple of Solomon. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6539.56s)]
*  You know, like you look at that and you see that. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6542.56s)]
*  Now, Newton today, you know, somebody like Don Lim would be like, oh, really? [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6545.56s)]
*  So you're going to believe Isaac fucking Newton with mercury in his hair and his little dollhouse like the Temple of Solomon. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6550.56s)]
*  Oh, yeah, he's he's a real scientist. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6557.56s)]
*  That's not what they look like. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6560.56s)]
*  It's like these people are out of their fucking minds. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6561.56s)]
*  Sigmund Freud just injecting fucking liquid cocaine into his veins. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6564.56s)]
*  You look at like the history about his mom freaking out about his mom fucking shoving cigars up his ass. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6571.56s)]
*  I don't think he really did that, but I wouldn't be surprised. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6577.56s)]
*  I would be surprised. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6579.56s)]
*  But, you know, you look at the history of what brilliant people who have shifted the culture actually behave like Tesla. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6580.56s)]
*  Fucking Tesla did like, I don't know. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6588.56s)]
*  He was in love with his pigeon. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6590.56s)]
*  In love with a pigeon. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6591.56s)]
*  Didn't want to like the thought about castrating himself because his sex drive was getting in the way of his research. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6592.56s)]
*  So he's like, I'll just chop my dick off. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6598.56s)]
*  He did, dude. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6600.56s)]
*  I think there was a description of him destroying his sexuality. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6601.56s)]
*  Yeah, dude. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6604.56s)]
*  So so you sort of like realize that for whatever reason, the priest class of default reality of which Don Lemon is a high priest have suddenly created this ridiculous version of scientists [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6605.56s)]
*  of philosophers, of intellectuals that are domesticated people, normal fucking people is actually really awful in the sense that all of the like philosophers and scientists out there today who are like, you know, in their filthy fucking apartments, [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6619.56s)]
*  who've been staring into a candle for like five hours, they're not thinking like I'm a scientist. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6638.56s)]
*  They might be. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6644.56s)]
*  You don't know. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6645.56s)]
*  You don't know. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6646.56s)]
*  Like this this this new basically like it appears that the power structures in the world want to create this homogenous version of humanity within which there's all these D Claude people who completely align on a few ridiculous facts. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6647.56s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6668.56s)]
*  And you can make those people very Claude if you bond them together to attack anybody who doesn't stay in line. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6669.56s)]
*  That's right. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6675.56s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6676.56s)]
*  And that is what again, like a coup or you you get rid of the president, at least, you know, it's not the president tyranny where you don't have soldiers in the streets, but a kind of societal pressure and unending pressure trying to online bots, tick tock, the reels, the algorithm like, dude, have you ever looked at pendulums think up, but I don't watch tick tock. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6677.56s)]
*  I don't have to talk. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6702.56s)]
*  I know it sucks because I try to send you some tick tock shit. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6703.56s)]
*  You can't look at it. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6705.56s)]
*  I won't click on it. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6706.56s)]
*  But I don't the the the they probably already infected my phone just because you sent me those links. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6707.56s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6713.56s)]
*  Probably in the user agreement. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6714.56s)]
*  I still send them agree to infect other people's phones every time you send them a link. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6715.56s)]
*  I keep hoping you all of like I try not to give it in. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6718.56s)]
*  Well, it's it is so incredibly hypnotic like it is so advanced in what it does. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6722.56s)]
*  But not interested. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6729.56s)]
*  It's really creepy, though, because like it's it's sinking. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6730.56s)]
*  It's homogenizing people. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6734.56s)]
*  And that's what I don't like is like it's creating this synced up and it's creepy because like the tick tock dance is actually if you think about it, it's really a symbol of what it's doing for a lot of other things. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6736.56s)]
*  Like maybe you're not doing a choreographed dance with your family in front of the Christmas tree to some dumb song. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6747.56s)]
*  But why is it that everything you say I've read, I've seen written exactly in the same way on Reddit? [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6753.56s)]
*  Why is it that every opinion you have matches not just like the idea doesn't match, but the way you're verbalizing the idea is like a sentence that I've heard over and over and over again in different places. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6760.56s)]
*  That is so spooky to me. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6773.56s)]
*  So to me like that and also that it's called tick tock, which in my fucking paranoid universe, I keep thinking, is that the tick tock of a metronome that they're talking about? [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6776.56s)]
*  Getting people to dance to a certain cultural BPM. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6786.56s)]
*  Jamie, I'm going to send you something. [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6790.56s)]
*  I'm not sure if it's true. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6791.56s)]
*  So I want you to find out if it's true. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6792.56s)]
*  And it was someone was saying that there's a whole series of I saved it on Twitter. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6794.56s)]
*  It's a link on Twitter. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6802.56s)]
*  That's what it is. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6803.56s)]
*  There's a whole series of people who are claiming to be doctors saying the exact same thing. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6804.56s)]
*  I saw that. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6811.56s)]
*  I know. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6812.56s)]
*  Is that real though? [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6813.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6814.56s)]
*  The problem with those things is like people bullshit. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6815.56s)]
*  And when people bullsh- here it is. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6817.56s)]
*  I'll send it to Jamie. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6819.56s)]
*  When people bullshit, it's really hard to tell, you know, because if you change this and, you know, create this in Photoshop and then people start spreading it, then all of a sudden that narrative gets out. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6820.56s)]
*  And most people don't ever hear, oh, no, no, no, somebody made that in Photoshop. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6832.56s)]
*  Right. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6835.56s)]
*  So by the time it gets around, it's like, I don't know. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6836.56s)]
*  I don't know if it's true or not. [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6837.56s)]
*  Right. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6838.56s)]
*  These are one of those. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6839.56s)]
*  So it's like if that's true and if all these doctors were tweeting out the exact same verbiage exactly, I wonder if that's a mandate. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6840.56s)]
*  I wonder if they're sent something like a mass email. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6851.56s)]
*  Mass email. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6853.56s)]
*  That says copy and paste this perhaps. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6854.56s)]
*  Discord server. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6857.56s)]
*  Or I wonder if they're fake doctors or I wonder, you know, if it's like some bot program designed to encourage people to go get vaccinated or whatever it was. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6858.56s)]
*  I just don't know if it was real. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6867.56s)]
*  So I don't want to like I want to Dr. Jamie to look at it real quick. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6868.56s)]
*  Thank you, Jamie. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6872.56s)]
*  Jamie's super skeptical to the point of being a liberal. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6873.56s)]
*  Oh. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6875.56s)]
*  Why does that have to- why is that the end result? [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6876.56s)]
*  He's triggered. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6881.56s)]
*  He's triggered. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6882.56s)]
*  That narrative gets around. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6883.56s)]
*  I know, I know. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6884.56s)]
*  Jamie's not a liberal, folks. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6885.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6886.56s)]
*  Jamie's very down the middle. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6887.56s)]
*  Hey, Jamie's not a liberal. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6888.56s)]
*  I would say you're a centrist. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6890.56s)]
*  Is that correct? [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6891.56s)]
*  Sure. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6892.56s)]
*  I think so, right? [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6893.56s)]
*  This is weird. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6894.56s)]
*  I'm just looking at the account. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6895.56s)]
*  I'm trying to figure out a way to research it. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6896.56s)]
*  I might have to like Twitter's or Google search the image. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6898.56s)]
*  See if the thing has been community noted. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6901.56s)]
*  I do see one different- here's what difference I'm noticing just looking at it. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6905.56s)]
*  Different font. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6909.56s)]
*  Well, the third thing that they're saying is a little different because it's starting to be a joke. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6910.56s)]
*  Suggma is a joke. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6914.56s)]
*  It's something that's Suggma nuts. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6915.56s)]
*  Oh, really? [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6917.56s)]
*  Suggma variant. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6918.56s)]
*  Suggma is another one. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6919.56s)]
*  Hilarious. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6920.56s)]
*  It's hilarious. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6921.56s)]
*  That's a brilliant troll. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6922.56s)]
*  That's very funny. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6923.56s)]
*  It's already in troll space. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6924.56s)]
*  Okay, so it does mean- so it could be that a bunch of people just decided to retweet it for funsies? [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6926.56s)]
*  Some of them are response. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6932.56s)]
*  Well, why don't you go to their accounts? [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6934.56s)]
*  Look up any of these accounts. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6935.56s)]
*  I was going to- that's what I was going to do next. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6936.56s)]
*  Or it could have been one of those things where someone got caught. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6937.56s)]
*  Do you remember when there was this like misinformation video that got out? [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6940.56s)]
*  There was all these local news anchors giving the same exact speech in verbatim, in tune, in time. [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6945.56s)]
*  It's really weird. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6952.56s)]
*  Play that, Jamie. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6954.56s)]
*  Do you know how that happens? [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6955.56s)]
*  Yeah, they get given some- [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6957.56s)]
*  They just get the same script. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6959.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's like local news stuff. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6960.56s)]
*  It usually happens with Sinclair Media. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6962.56s)]
*  Right, but it's about misinformation. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6964.56s)]
*  Oh, yeah, right. [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6966.56s)]
*  It's weird. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6968.56s)]
*  It's weird because they're basically protecting their job. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6969.56s)]
*  So what it is, they've been caught stealing money. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6972.56s)]
*  They've got a big fucking pot of gold. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6974.56s)]
*  And the people are at the door like, I heard you got gold in there. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6976.56s)]
*  What you're hearing is misinformation. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6980.56s)]
*  It's all misinformation. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6982.56s)]
*  We are the number one source of news and we're dedicated to give you the true objective. [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6984.56s)]
*  They're all reciting the same script. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6991.56s)]
*  Right. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6993.56s)]
*  Is it what company? [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6994.56s)]
*  Sinclair Media. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6995.56s)]
*  Sinclair. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6996.56s)]
*  So they make them- let's just play it though because it's so crazy. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=6997.56s)]
*  That these people are the people that are in charge of giving you the news [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7000.56s)]
*  and they're reading off this thing pretending that these are their thoughts. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7004.56s)]
*  This is what's bizarre about that where it's untenable. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7008.56s)]
*  Because people know those are not their thoughts. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7011.56s)]
*  They know they're reading off a script. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7014.56s)]
*  Right. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7015.56s)]
*  Everybody knows it. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7016.56s)]
*  So it doesn't work. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7017.56s)]
*  You're just making noise with your mouth and people are still on Twitter. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7018.56s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7022.56s)]
*  They're still like reading what's actually going on versus what you're saying. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7023.56s)]
*  Also, you know, the idea is you get these people to dress up like humans [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7027.56s)]
*  and then just get them to like in tone, whatever the fucking thing is you want them to read. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7032.56s)]
*  And we think they're one of us. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7036.56s)]
*  And so we believe them. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7038.56s)]
*  Jamie, did I send you the thing where the girl is- excuse me, the woman- [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7039.56s)]

*  They're not ours and they're not an adversary. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7052.56s)]
*  That's I think I think I tweeted. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7055.56s)]
*  I sent it to you. [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7057.56s)]
*  That's the one where she's wearing the UFO necklace. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7058.56s)]
*  You'll see she's wearing a UFO. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7059.56s)]
*  She's a kook. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7060.56s)]

*  I like that. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7300.120000000001s)]
*  I like that the president can pardon some people. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7301.120000000001s)]
*  I wish they pardoned Ed Snowden. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7303.32s)]
*  Yeah, you know, there's a bunch of Julian Assange. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7305.32s)]
*  They should have pardoned Julian Assange. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7308.0s)]
*  I wish there was, you know, a way to stop someone from pardoning 8000 fucking people. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7310.24s)]
*  Some of them are like murderers. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7315.56s)]
*  Some of them are the kids for cash judge. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7317.56s)]
*  Kids for cash. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7320.48s)]
*  One of them or one of the people. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7321.64s)]
*  We talked about this the other day. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7323.14s)]
*  He's one of the people. [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7324.4s)]
*  He had two years left in his sentence. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7325.4s)]
*  But still, like, it's the principle of the thing. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7327.12s)]
*  How many lives were destroyed by that kids for cash thing? [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7329.84s)]
*  How many dehumanizing decisions were made where you decided to lock young people up [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7332.88s)]
*  in detention centers where they would get raped and beaten up and tortured and separated [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7338.360000000001s)]
*  from their family and sent down a horrible road of distrust of law enforcement and of [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7343.320000000001s)]
*  authority and everything else. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7351.320000000001s)]
*  Everything else. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7353.8s)]
*  You're basically setting them up for a life of being a fucking loser unless they have [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7354.8s)]
*  the strongest of wills and they could figure out a way to stay positive and get through [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7359.12s)]
*  it and then use that to fuel whatever the fuck they do. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7364.04s)]
*  That's so rare, man. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7368.16s)]
*  Those people are so rare. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7370.36s)]
*  Well here's the problem, man. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7372.68s)]
*  I mean, the problem is, well, number one, I think, OK, like you pull someone over, you [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7373.68s)]
*  breathalyze them. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7379.84s)]
*  They're driving drunk, right? [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7381.16s)]
*  So you're like, you can't drive now because you're drunk. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7382.48s)]
*  So also you wouldn't say to them, I'm going to give you the ability to pardon as many [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7386.2s)]
*  people as you want for any crime that you want, right? [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7391.0s)]
*  So if somebody has dementia, right? [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7393.72s)]
*  Why can they do all the pardons? [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7398.84s)]
*  It's kind of weird. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7400.4s)]
*  That's so crazy. [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7401.4s)]
*  That's such a great point that I never even thought of. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7402.4s)]
*  Why would you still give them that power? [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7405.04s)]
*  Well, the other thing that's really fucking crazy about it is I don't know what the president [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7406.84s)]
*  makes a year, but it's not enough money. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7411.68s)]
*  We barely pay the president anything. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7413.72s)]
*  I think it's like $400,000. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7415.639999999999s)]
*  $400,000 a year. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7417.12s)]
*  You can't say that's barely enough. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7418.12s)]
*  That's barely enough. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7420.4s)]
*  No, I mean for the actual job. [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7421.4s)]
*  I mean, literally every day you're shitting blood because no matter what you do, you say [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7423.679999999999s)]
*  the wrong thing, 5,000 people accidentally die. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7429.0s)]
*  It's the most stressful job on earth. [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7431.4s)]
*  I'm saying the actual thing, theoretically in my mind. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7433.12s)]
*  So I would say, you know, in the way that we pay our football players a shit ton of [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7435.92s)]
*  money, baseball players a shit ton of money, the dude theoretically keeping our country [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7440.32s)]
*  from getting nuked should make a lot of money. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7445.24s)]
*  Why not? [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7447.48s)]
*  How about this? [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7448.48s)]
*  How about we pay them more but they can't do speeches? [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7449.48s)]
*  No speeches afterwards. [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7452.12s)]
*  No paid speeches when you leave. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7453.5599999999995s)]
*  You can write books. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7454.76s)]
*  You can write books, but none of those paid bank speeches. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7455.76s)]
*  None of those $500,000 speeches. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7459.2s)]
*  To me it's like on your way out, you sell pardons. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7462.92s)]
*  On your way out, via some God knows what mechanism that's probably been in place for a long time, [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7466.32s)]
*  people are able to give you this or that and you pardon that person. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7473.44s)]
*  That's where it's fucked up. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7479.919999999999s)]
*  It's like, dude, come on, man. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7480.919999999999s)]
*  That's trading. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7483.5199999999995s)]
*  That's how it works. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7484.5199999999995s)]
*  That's how it works. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7485.5199999999995s)]
*  I'll give you a little this, you give me a little that, we do it right in front of the [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7486.5199999999995s)]
*  world. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7488.4s)]
*  We're going to let out murderers. [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7489.4s)]
*  And then especially if you got cooed. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7491.12s)]
*  So especially you got cooed, you got humiliated, they didn't give you your drugs. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7494.32s)]
*  Why isn't he letting out Joe Exotic? [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7498.04s)]
*  It's insane. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7500.96s)]
*  Let him out. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7501.96s)]
*  Let him out. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7503.4800000000005s)]
*  You're going to do kids for cash. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7504.4800000000005s)]
*  You're not going to do Joe fucking Exotic. [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7505.4800000000005s)]
*  And how is Joe Exotic DMing me? [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7507.52s)]
*  How is this happening? [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7509.0s)]
*  I think he knows, because you will say things like this. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7510.0s)]
*  Does he have a phone? [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7512.8s)]
*  Joe? [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7513.8s)]
*  Are you allowed to have a phone, Joe? [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7514.8s)]
*  Can you have a Twitter account? [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7515.8s)]
*  Joe, I feel like right now because of your aiding Trump and getting elected, and I don't [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7517.8s)]
*  think you're the kind of person to do this, but I do feel like you could probably call [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7526.0s)]
*  in at least one favor. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7529.4s)]
*  Get Joe Exotic out. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7531.0s)]
*  Dude, why not? [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7532.04s)]
*  For all of us. [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7533.88s)]
*  Russ Albrecht first. [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7534.88s)]
*  Okay, sure. [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7536.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7537.88s)]
*  I mean, obviously there's a price on people to find out. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7538.88s)]
*  I think Trump committed to doing that. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7539.88s)]
*  To releasing it. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7542.96s)]
*  Really? [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7543.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7544.96s)]
*  Well, I mean- [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7545.96s)]
*  Find out if that's true, Jamie? [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7546.96s)]
*  I believe it is. [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7547.96s)]
*  I believe he was one of those Bitcoin fucking things that he did. [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7548.96s)]

*  He said that in the- Dave said that, the libertarian thing. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7554.4s)]
*  Yes, that's right. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7556.88s)]
*  Libertarian. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7557.88s)]
*  Libertarian and Bitcoin are the same fucking category in my brain. [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7559.76s)]
*  When I'm barely tuned in, it's all the same. [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7562.76s)]

*  Yeah, I'm a libertarian. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7568.64s)]

*  Cash. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7601.36s)]

*  Top 10, probably. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7603.36s)]

*  And so you lose that power. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7771.5199999999995s)]
*  And now what? [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7773.16s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7774.16s)]
*  Now what? [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7775.16s)]

*  It didn't work. [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7780.36s)]

*  Well no. [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7808.86s)]
*  I think it's going to be all go out the window. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7809.86s)]
*  I think quantum computing is going to crush encryption. [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7811.74s)]
*  We're going to have a real problem with currency worldwide. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7814.139999999999s)]
*  We're going to have to figure out how to redistribute resources without conventional capitalism. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7817.5s)]
*  There's going to be some weird new shifting that's going to come along with the birth [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7822.38s)]
*  of this AI that's way more intelligent than us. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7827.3s)]
*  And everything's going to get super fucking weird and we're not ready for it. [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7830.62s)]
*  And we think that we have to be ready for it. [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7834.74s)]
*  It's not going to happen like that because I'm not ready for it. [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7836.42s)]
*  No one's ready for it. [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7837.86s)]
*  No it couldn't happen just like a super volcano and just like an asteroid impact. [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7838.86s)]
*  It can happen and you're not ready for it. [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7842.46s)]
*  That's right. [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7844.42s)]

*  That's right. [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7846.42s)]
*  Okay. [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7848.34s)]
*  This as far as like AGI goes, it like when Altman came out and said this year, the CEO [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7849.34s)]
*  from the company I think that made, I don't know, one of the other AIs said two years [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7858.62s)]
*  from now I think. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7863.26s)]
*  But the idea is if Biden came out and was like, guys got some news. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7864.42s)]
*  We've detected a mothership. [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7871.7s)]

*  technology based on what we've seen of their ship. [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7881.02s)]
*  I'm good. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7883.7s)]
*  The whole planet, the next few years would just be getting ready. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7885.0s)]
*  NASA, anthropologists, philosophers, scientists, defense people. [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7888.34s)]
*  What do we do if they want to fuck us up? [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7892.26s)]
*  What do we do? [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7894.7s)]
*  How do you interact with aliens? [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7895.7s)]
*  But having these tech people say we are about to have a brand new species, essentially a [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7897.5s)]
*  technological species, an AGI is coming to the planet that will surpass us as far as [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7904.34s)]
*  being able to solve problems, will know everything. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7911.58s)]
*  It's going to be here in about a year, maybe two years. [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7916.22s)]
*  You would think the reaction to that would be, okay, we've got to get ready for this. [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7918.66s)]
*  What does that mean? [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7922.26s)]
*  What's going to happen? [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7923.4800000000005s)]
*  And we can't get ready. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7924.4800000000005s)]

*  We just have to fucking die screaming. [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7927.66s)]
*  Merry Christmas! [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7929.9800000000005s)]
*  Ho ho ho! [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7931.98s)]
*  Maybe it can't be solved just like Australia Pythagoras couldn't figure out how to make [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7933.98s)]
*  a plane. [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7938.66s)]
*  We're not prepared for it. [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7940.379999999999s)]
*  And we're not supposed to last. [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7942.299999999999s)]
*  We're supposed to carry on to the next thing. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7943.7s)]
*  And the next thing will still be us. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7946.139999999999s)]
*  That's what's going to be weird. [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7948.58s)]
*  The next thing is going to still be us. [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7949.62s)]
*  We just want us to stay us like this. [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7951.4s)]
*  We want fucking blues songs and we want to drink whiskey. [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7953.54s)]
*  We want to smoke cigarettes. [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7957.5s)]
*  We want to get in fist fights. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7959.339999999999s)]
*  We want us to stay us. [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7962.02s)]
*  It's not going to happen. [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7964.86s)]
*  I'm sure if you could travel back in time and there was an intelligent, semi-intelligent [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7966.02s)]
*  version of humanity, one of our ancestors who still had a workable tale. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7973.22s)]
*  And you're like, hey, I want to show you what you're going to grow into. [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7978.06s)]
*  And probably there'd be a lot of things they're excited about. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7982.34s)]
*  Whoa, cars? [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7985.14s)]
*  Incredible. [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7986.38s)]
*  Jesus Christ, you can shit in your own house? [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7987.38s)]
*  Wow! [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7989.74s)]
*  But then they would see that we didn't have tails. [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7990.86s)]
*  And they'd be like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7993.099999999999s)]
*  I'm not doing that if I lose my tail. [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7996.42s)]
*  So this is for sure the sort of cultural drama that we're seeing. [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=7999.299999999999s)]
*  And you know, the trans controversy, there's aspects to it where like, yeah, dude shouldn't [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8007.46s)]
*  be in sports. [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8015.98s)]
*  But the reality is, where we're going is going to make that controversy seem like nothing. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8017.1s)]
*  Not only that, it seems like if you wanted to have an evolutionary path towards a genderless [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8025.14s)]
*  society, wouldn't you have that society, if you wanted to tame the wild primate, wouldn't [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8030.9800000000005s)]
*  you have that society be completely addicted to plastic? [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8037.46s)]
*  They use plastic for everything, which is an endocrine disruptor. [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8041.700000000001s)]
*  So you have these plastic and these chemicals that get into the body, lower testosterone, [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8045.94s)]
*  shrink dicks, shrink taints. [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8053.5s)]
*  Dr. Shanna Swann's work. [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8055.0599999999995s)]
*  They shrink taints? [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8056.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8057.339999999999s)]
*  Shanna Swann, have you ever talked to her? [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8058.339999999999s)]
*  I didn't know the taint could shrink. [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8060.0199999999995s)]
*  You should talk. [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8062.0199999999995s)]
*  No, well, it's in utero. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8063.0199999999995s)]
*  So this is what happens. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8064.7s)]
*  When you introduce mammals to that, her book is called? [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8065.7s)]
*  I think it's Countdown. [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8069.54s)]
*  Countdown, that's right. [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8071.5s)]
*  I used to remember it. [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8072.5s)]
*  It's a great book. [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8074.9s)]
*  She's really fun too. [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8076.7s)]
*  She's a really fascinating person. [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8078.0s)]
*  But what they found is with mammals, when you introduce phthalates, which are these [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8080.16s)]
*  plastics, like microplastics and the chemicals that come off of them, into pregnant women [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8085.0599999999995s)]
*  or pregnant mice, the babies have smaller taints. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8091.379999999999s)]
*  And then the taint is one of the best ways to distinguish a male or female in mammals. [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8096.98s)]
*  No way. [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8100.9s)]
*  The taint is 50 to 100% longer. [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8102.9s)]
*  Is it really called the taint? [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8104.9s)]
*  They don't call it the taint. [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8106.9s)]
*  They have a word for it, she told me, but she calls it the taint because she's fun. [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8107.9s)]
*  She has a thing on her website called the Jizz Quiz. [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8110.9s)]
*  It's very funny. [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8113.7s)]
*  She's very funny. [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8114.78s)]
*  And she's a really distinguished professor. [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8115.78s)]
*  But what she's saying essentially is that these plastics are lowering hormone levels. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8118.299999999999s)]
*  They are lowering birth rate levels. [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8124.5s)]
*  They're increasing in the amount of miscarriages that women have. [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8127.5s)]
*  So all these things she believes are completely connected, and that this hormone disruptor [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8131.28s)]
*  that is in these plastics is causing people to become sicker and a little bit deformed [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8137.32s)]
*  because your hormones aren't expressing themselves correctly because they're being poisoned. [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8144.679999999999s)]
*  If you were a society, like if you were going to get to where the aliens are, they look [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8149.48s)]
*  genderless, don't they? [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8155.28s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8156.28s)]
*  Don't you think that's probably us in the future? [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8157.28s)]
*  Aren't you glad they're genderless? [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8158.679999999999s)]
*  Sure. [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8160.28s)]
*  Can you imagine if the greys had big swinging dicks? [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8161.28s)]
*  Giant hogs. [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8164.28s)]
*  It would be horrible. [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8165.28s)]
*  Those grey pictures would be very different. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8166.28s)]
*  Very different. [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8168.28s)]
*  Standing over your bed, jacking off in your face. [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8169.28s)]
*  Horrible. [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8171.28s)]
*  Yeah, while you're paralyzed, you're sitting there like, oh, this fucking piece of shit. [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8172.28s)]
*  I think that we are clinging to this idea of male and female. [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8177.88s)]
*  Look, I think currently there are male and females, for sure. [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8183.28s)]
*  And this is why I'm completely opposed to biological males who have mental illness. [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8186.98s)]
*  And that's what gender dysphoria is, even if you're being kind. [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8192.58s)]
*  It's a mental illness. [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8195.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8196.5s)]
*  Whatever it is, you're not well in who you are. [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8197.5s)]
*  You wish you were a different gender. [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8200.859999999999s)]
*  I fully support you. [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8202.14s)]
*  That's not what I want to, but you can't compete with biological females. [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8203.14s)]
*  We can't pretend that you're a biological female because we want you to feel good. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8206.3s)]
*  You have massive physical advantages. [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8209.96s)]
*  They've been clearly documented. [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8211.66s)]
*  Anybody who says any differently is full of shit. [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8213.38s)]
*  Talk to Riley Gaines. [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8215.42s)]
*  Talk to her. [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8216.86s)]
*  She's the expert in this shit. [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8217.86s)]
*  She had to go through that shit with swimming. [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8218.86s)]
*  It feels crazy to me that you have to say that. [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8221.1s)]
*  It's so crazy. [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8224.06s)]
*  It's so crazy that you have to say that to liberals who always wanted to protect women. [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8225.06s)]
*  The whole thing is bonkers, but it just goes to show you it's not real. [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8228.86s)]
*  This idea of left and right is not real. [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8232.9s)]
*  These are just masks that people put on. [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8235.78s)]
*  These are just a conglomeration of opinions that people adopt. [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8238.62s)]
*  Most people have not thought most of the things through. [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8242.18s)]
*  They don't have the time. [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8244.76s)]
*  They have to work all fucking day. [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8246.84s)]
*  They have a family. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8248.16s)]
*  Maybe they have a hobby. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8249.16s)]
*  They're trying to get out and play hoops with their friends. [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8250.16s)]
*  Maybe they get together with their buddies and they want to play video games one night [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8252.76s)]
*  a week. [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8256.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8257.0s)]
*  They don't have fucking time to pay attention to all this crazy shit. [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8258.0s)]
*  That's what's really going on. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8262.28s)]
*  Most people are just deciding that I'm a progressive. [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8264.32s)]
*  I will repeat progressive talking points. [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8268.48s)]
*  I will violently defend a woman's right to choose. [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8270.76s)]
*  They get into these patterns and then the same thing happens on the right. [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8273.4s)]
*  The exact same thing. [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8277.199999999999s)]
*  Exact same thing. [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8279.039999999999s)]
*  That's why the right is against the war in Ukraine and the left is supporting it. [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8280.64s)]
*  This is like Vietnam in reverse. [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8285.68s)]
*  The whole thing is fucking bananas. [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8287.38s)]
*  The right is insisting on free speech. [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8289.92s)]
*  They were the motherfuckers that were censoring everybody. [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8292.16s)]
*  They wanted to lock Howard Stern up in jail. [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8294.199999999999s)]
*  He had to fight. [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8297.64s)]
*  It's crazy. [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8298.64s)]
*  They sued him. [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8299.64s)]
*  The parent company had to pay untold amounts of money. [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8301.039999999999s)]
*  How much money did Howard Stern's company get fined? [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8304.039999999999s)]
*  It was hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions. [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8306.199999999999s)]
*  Insane amounts of money. [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8309.599999999999s)]
*  The fucking government was trying to shut down a radio guy for talking shit. [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8310.599999999999s)]
*  It's crazy. [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8315.96s)]
*  Now that's the left. [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8316.96s)]
*  It's just patterns, man. [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8318.68s)]
*  It's just patterns where people can justify certain behaviors because it aligns with their [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8320.8s)]
*  ideology. [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8325.48s)]
*  That's right. [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8326.48s)]
*  Where it gets really fucked up is you are dancing to a song that basically there's like [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8327.64s)]
*  here's two songs. [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8334.92s)]
*  There's two songs you can dance to. [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8335.96s)]
*  The right song or the song of the left. [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8337.24s)]
*  The metronome is beating out two, I guess, somewhat different rhythms. [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8340.02s)]
*  People dance to those. [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8345.359999999999s)]
*  They get in fights over, you got to do our dance. [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8346.359999999999s)]
*  Meanwhile, there's a million other songs out there you could be dancing to. [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8348.8s)]
*  And there's songs that are much older than America, much older than maybe the planet [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8353.6s)]
*  itself, which is that's why I really think it's creepy the way that Christianity or any [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8359.560000000001s)]
*  religion where there's theism, it's in the list of things that should be decried by an [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8371.800000000001s)]
*  intelligent person. [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8378.44s)]
*  We shoot down this notion of God. [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8379.44s)]
*  We shoot down this or that. [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8380.880000000001s)]
*  But all of these religions, at the very least, they give you a new song to dance to that [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8382.34s)]
*  isn't fucking war drums. [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8388.42s)]
*  And they don't like that. [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8391.86s)]
*  They don't like that because suddenly you're supposed to be perturbed. [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8392.86s)]
*  Like you know that stupid bump. [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8396.460000000001s)]
*  But it's also the arrogance of intellectualism. [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8397.86s)]
*  You get really smart and these fairy tales seem preposterous to you. [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8400.22s)]
*  And you don't want to accept that maybe what it is is a moral scaffolding that keeps society [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8404.42s)]
*  glued together. [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8408.78s)]
*  And it's probably based on some truth. [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8410.06s)]
*  There's some of it that seems to be a history of the world. [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8413.26s)]
*  Oh, and also to most people that I have encountered who have a lot of people have encountered [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8416.82s)]
*  who are rejecting this religion or that. [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8424.38s)]
*  I get it. [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8427.42s)]
*  It's religious trauma. [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8428.42s)]
*  I just ran into somebody at Best Buy, recognized me, had a long conversation. [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8429.42s)]
*  Religious trauma. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8433.18s)]
*  They were raised in some kind of like form of spiritual abuse and in that abuse- [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8434.22s)]
*  Snake handlers. [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8438.619999999999s)]
*  Bingo. [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8439.980000000001s)]
*  But listen, if you want to handle snakes, great. [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8440.980000000001s)]
*  The problem is if you tell a kid to disregard their rational mind. [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8444.18s)]
*  In other words, the introduction to the conversation of questions regarding this or that are not [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8450.660000000002s)]
*  met with like, oh yeah, it's a good question. [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8456.380000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8458.220000000001s)]
*  But are met with, you're going to hell. [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8459.220000000001s)]
*  You're going to hell. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8462.220000000001s)]
*  You're demon possessed. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8463.220000000001s)]
*  So then you experience that. [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8464.220000000001s)]
*  And of course you must reject the thing. [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8465.62s)]
*  It's like when you have a hangover and you smell tequila, you can't connect. [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8467.58s)]
*  So I get it. [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8472.18s)]
*  But the main thing is what I love about religion or Christianity is it's like, just try it [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8473.38s)]
*  on for size. [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8484.38s)]
*  What happens if you pray? [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8486.539999999999s)]
*  I know you don't believe in it. [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8488.02s)]
*  Sounds insane. [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8489.22s)]
*  What the fuck are they talking about? [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8490.22s)]
*  Sounds absolutely nuts. [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8491.42s)]
*  I know it sounds absolutely nuts. [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8492.86s)]
*  Now what happens? [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8495.7s)]
*  If you pray just for a few days, what happens if you pray? [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8497.26s)]
*  And then once you start doing the experiment, it starts off with like, this is just, I'm [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8501.300000000001s)]
*  going to do it. [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8508.02s)]
*  It's probably bullshit, the opium of the masses. [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8509.02s)]
*  But then you realize you're getting pulled in, not in a bad way, but right away there [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8511.62s)]
*  seems to be some feeling of connection, some sense of something a little different than [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8517.22s)]
*  what you're used to experiencing. [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8521.58s)]
*  And sometimes that can get really scary for people. [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8523.54s)]
*  And they're like, fuck this. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8526.26s)]
*  No, it's getting me. [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8527.86s)]
*  And it's like, to me, that should be the experiment of anyone who's skeptical. [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8529.82s)]
*  And if you're skeptical about Christianity or any religion, you should be. [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8536.58s)]
*  You should 100% be skeptical of, it's like what Mark Twain said, religion is what happened [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8541.42s)]
*  when the first con man met the first fool. [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8546.92s)]
*  You should be skeptical. [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8550.1s)]
*  But if you read the Gospels and you realize like the part of the story there is an invitation [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8552.02s)]
*  to connect on your own, you don't need the priest class. [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8560.46s)]
*  You don't have to listen to the fucking rules. [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8564.42s)]
*  You don't have to like, it's just between you and the eternal and see what happens. [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8566.359999999999s)]
*  To me, that's the number one thing is just investigate, explore, and don't let anyone [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8572.34s)]
*  subvert your rational mind. [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8578.82s)]
*  Use that as a form of connecting with the thing. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8581.26s)]
*  Even if you connect via rejection, it's still worth like a wholehearted exploration, at [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8584.7s)]
*  the very least to experience a cultural trance. [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8589.82s)]
*  I don't think that's what it is. [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8592.5s)]
*  Maybe what that cultural trance is, is this is like, it's a pattern that you can follow [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8596.02s)]
*  that can connect you to the divine. [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8605.62s)]
*  And there's a bunch of these different patterns. [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8608.18s)]
*  This pattern might be Buddhism, this pattern might be Islam, this pattern might be even [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8610.38s)]
*  Mormonism, even Scientology. [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8616.3s)]
*  Definitely Scientology. [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8618.779999999999s)]
*  I think all of them, all of them can be distorted. [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8620.179999999998s)]
*  All of them can be subverted. [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8624.14s)]
*  All of them can have those guys that have private jets and Rolls Royces and you know, [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8625.699999999999s)]
*  those fucking crazy arena guys. [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8629.939999999999s)]
*  All of it can go in that direction. [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8631.82s)]
*  But all of it is kind of a moral scaffolding that seems to be designed to help us in this [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8635.78s)]
*  journey of getting away from the primate instincts. [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8644.94s)]
*  That's right. [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8648.66s)]
*  And getting away from, and also connecting to each other. [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8649.66s)]
*  And transcending state propaganda. [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8653.1s)]
*  Like this is the, this is like my favorite verse in the Bible. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8655.82s)]
*  They're trying to trick Jesus. [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8659.78s)]
*  I don't know, they're asking. [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8661.26s)]
*  Imagine him being so cocky you think he can trick Jesus. [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8663.7s)]
*  I would try. [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8666.300000000001s)]
*  I got it. [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8667.300000000001s)]
*  Maybe. [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8668.300000000001s)]
*  Fuck that dude. [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8669.300000000001s)]
*  Would be cool if you could. [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8670.300000000001s)]
*  I'm gonna bring out three card Monte. [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8671.300000000001s)]
*  We're gonna get him. [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8672.300000000001s)]
*  Imagine Jesus walking down New York City and watching him play three card Monte and getting [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8673.300000000001s)]
*  suckered in. [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8677.34s)]
*  You're like, hey, I thought you were the fucking, I thought you were the guy. [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8678.34s)]
*  Hey man, don't do that. [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8681.86s)]
*  He's, you don't understand. [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8684.54s)]
*  It's not the same card. [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8686.060000000001s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8687.060000000001s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8688.060000000001s)]

*  You're out of shekels. [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8690.060000000001s)]
*  Is that what they use shekels? [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8691.060000000001s)]
*  I guess. [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8692.060000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8693.42s)]
*  Denarius. [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8694.42s)]
*  What kind of dollars did they have? [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8695.42s)]
*  What unit of money was around when Jesus existed? [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8697.58s)]
*  It's a good question. [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8700.46s)]
*  Super good question. [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8701.46s)]
*  I wish I knew it. [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8702.46s)]
*  It'd be a clever thing to say. [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8703.46s)]
*  Shekels sounds good though. [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8706.26s)]
*  Shekels is a fun name for coins. [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8708.5s)]
*  Shekels. [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=8710.3s)]

*  Farting in jars. [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=9023.5s)]

*  They're separate things. [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONV76ZfcPao&t=9152.06s)]
