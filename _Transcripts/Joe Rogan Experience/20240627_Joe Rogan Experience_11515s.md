# Joe Rogan Experience #1939 - B-Real
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6.0s)]
*  It's good to be here, bro. Good to see you, my friend. Yeah. We're up and at them. What's going on, man? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=12.0s)]
*  Chilling, man. Working hard as always. Escape from LA. Escape from LA, man. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=17.0s)]
*  Every time we go on tour, that's what I look at it like. Any shows, all right, we're getting away for a little bit. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=23.0s)]
*  Just take a breather. I have hope LA comes back. I really do. I hope it re-emerges as what it used to be or better. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=31.0s)]
*  Yeah. I believe it can too. Sure. It possibly might, man, but it's going to take a minute before we get the right people in there running the spot. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=39.0s)]
*  Who are the right people though? That's the problem. That's hard to say, right? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=51.0s)]
*  Because, I mean, it's just hard to trust any politician these days, man. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=55.0s)]
*  I mean, my friends have hit me up like, hey, when are you going to run for mayor? I'm like, I'm definitely running for mayor. Are you crazy? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=61.0s)]
*  Bro, you would win. I probably would. Oh my God, you would win. That would be the curse of me, right? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=69.0s)]
*  It would be the curse, bro. They would go digging deep into your past. Exactly. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=75.0s)]
*  Yeah, they'd find a bunch of liars, distort a bunch of facts, come up with a narrative. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=79.0s)]
*  As much of an open book as I've been, you know, and open about everything I've done. Yeah, they'll always dig deeper to try to find more, especially when you're in that kind of spot, you know? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=84.0s)]
*  For sure. Also, if you're an open book, they'll still rewrite your chapters. They'll rewrite the chapters? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=96.0s)]
*  They'll go in there and go, no, no, no, no, no, no, this is this, let's change this around and make it a lot worse than it really was. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=100.0s)]
*  Absolutely. It's a dirty game. Who fucking wants to? That's the problem. Who wants to do that job? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=105.0s)]
*  You know what? It's crazy. The people that want to do that job these days, they're not there to do any work of what politicians supposed to do. They're trying to get famous. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=111.0s)]
*  You know, they want to be famous for something because now that's it's a seat to be famous in, you know? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=122.0s)]
*  Then it's a shame because people that would actually maybe do the work, they don't even got a chance to get in there because they don't want to be famous. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=128.0s)]
*  They're trying to get in there to do the work while others like, you know, they're like, I got this seat. I'm showboating this shit. Oh, you know, this whole run. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=137.0s)]
*  I didn't worry about it at all before COVID. I'm like, who gives a fuck who the mayor is? It runs. LA runs. They figured out. It's crazy. It's chaotic. There's a lot of people, but it works. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=145.0s)]
*  Now I'm like, oh my God, that shit's important. It's so important. Oh my God. Who the governor is, who the mayor is. That shit is super important. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=154.0s)]
*  You know, when you're young, you don't pay attention to any of that stuff. You're just sort of living, going, trying to make your way. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=162.0s)]
*  As you get older, you start paying attention to the world and you're like, hey, wait a minute. Yeah. Once you have children and once you buy property, you're like, hey, and you're paying taxes. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=169.0s)]
*  What the fuck is going on? They keep jacking up the taxes in California. The tents keep stacking up. I have hope. I have hope. I root for them. I hope this new mayor, I hope she nails it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=180.0s)]
*  Yeah. Hopefully she does something about it. But it does cost a lot to live in California these days. It's crazy. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=191.0s)]
*  It would be great if it went to a good thing. Like if it cost a lot, but everyone was taken care of. They dealt with the homeless situation. They dealt with the crime. They dealt with the poverty. They dealt with all the bullshit. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=198.0s)]
*  But that's not that doesn't seem to be the case. It's not it. I mean, you know, like so cannabis, we know generates California a huge amount of capital. Right. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=209.0s)]
*  And where did it go? Where does it go? Right. Does it go? They don't they don't ever tell you where it goes. But I could tell you there's a bridge up there on Sixth Street. Had to get the money from somewhere. Right. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=223.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, cannabis. I mean, what is the amount that cannabis is generating for California? It's got to be enormous. Yeah, it was for a time for a time. It's not anymore. It goes up and down. You know, in the pandemic, oddly enough, people had a lot of money to spend because of the checks and stuff like that. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=235.0s)]
*  But now the checks have run out and they got less money to spend. So, you know, it's always a roller coaster ride as it relates to what sales will be. There it is right there. Yeah. Marijuana tax revenue. One billion two hundred ninety four million six hundred and thirty two thousand seven hundred and ninety nine dollars. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=251.0s)]
*  I believe we're the highest tax state as it relates to cannabis. And it's crazy. Yeah. Look at the difference between Colorado, which also has a lot of weed, only four hundred and twenty three million. Yeah. They they gouged us, man. I mean, we saved. Well, the industry saved the state. I mean, you know, you live there for many years and California was in debt. Yeah, we had no surplus. Now we got surplus. We could build bridges that are multi multimillion dollar bridges. I had Mariana Vanzeller on the podcast from the beginning. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=271.0s)]
*  That television show, Trafficked. I don't know if you've seen that show. It's a great show on the National Geographic. Crazy. Crazy. Like she's boots on the ground journalist. She goes into the jungle where the cocaine manufacturers are. She went to the Congo for dealing with people that are trafficking in the Great Apes. Wild show. Wild shit. But she was talking about one of the problems with California is it's so difficult to get a license to sell weed regularly that the like like illegal sales of weed are up way more than regular. So they're not getting taxed. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=301.0s)]
*  They're not getting taxed on that because they made it difficult for people. Yeah. The people that operate legally are the ones getting tapped the hardest because you got to pay for all these regulations and all these fees and the taxation, whether you're in the cultivation aspect of it or you're the retail manufacturer distribution. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=331.0s)]
*  I mean, it's the taxation to operate is is high and the taxes on the on the consumer as well. So when you have that factored in and you got these these guys that are trapping as they call it right. Black market style. Yeah. They're they're making all the money and the state isn't really doing anything about that. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=353.0s)]
*  And they make it hard to get a license for people who might actually be able to navigate the business. But it's just so many hoops. You got to jump through. So much regulation. Yeah. It's unfortunate. But at least it's legal now. Yes. I remember in 2016 when it became legal, we were in the middle of a podcast. Yeah. We do an end of the world podcast during the election live at the Comedy Store. And then it came out that marijuana passed and it's legal. Everybody cheered. It was it was amazing. The whole place went. Yeah. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=375.0s)]
*  But it's crazy that legally, like federally, it's illegal. Yeah. It's still schedule one. You know, what's crazy is that more states are rolling over like, you know, because the federal government is leaving, leaving it up to the state to decide. Right. And some states are seeing what's happening in places like Colorado and where the tax and taxation ain't so high. And they are actually making a lot of money or the state is making a lot of money through cannabis. They're starting to consider. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=405.0s)]
*  Right. So you're seeing states roll over one at a time like New York. Yeah. For instance, we thought that should have been like way sooner. Way sooner. But we thought, OK, when New York rolls and let's just say Florida and Boston roll everywhere else will roll over slowly. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=435.0s)]
*  And that's and that's kind of what's happening. So, I mean, I think it's just a matter of time, man, where we will have it federally legal, but we're going to all pay the price until. Yeah. Then mushrooms, then mushrooms, mushrooms got to make its way through. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=453.0s)]
*  Oh, man, they got to make it. You know, what's crazy is the studies that they've been coming up with as of late, like how they've been using micro dose and moderate dose to treat people with depression and anxiety and all the other all the other business. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=469.0s)]
*  You know what I mean? And, you know, some therapists are talking about how they're actually using micro doses to to to help people like, let's just say that they had some sort of ailment like migraines, for instance. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=486.0s)]
*  Right. They they say that they can disconnect whatever that is and rewire, you know, your whatever it is causing the migraines to stop them. Yeah, we're the worst dudes to be talking about neurochemistry. Yeah, we are. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=504.0s)]
*  Yeah, rewire. Yeah, I mean, supposedly psilocybin rather is one of the very best things for for that. Yeah. For curing addictions and people that are dealing with like real serious problems with PTSD and people that are dying, have massive anxiety, it alleviates end of life anxiety for them. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=518.0s)]
*  Yes, people with anger issues, too. I mean, you know, it's it's people that pop off for any given reason, man. You give them some micro doses and they're the nicest people in the world. Yeah, I mean, that's the that's for sure. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=542.0s)]
*  I mean, cannabis makes people so much friendlier. Yeah, you know, you don't I think it just it puts you in a relaxed state, whether you choose it or not. Right. I've I've stood out of a lot of altercations being as high as I am, because like, you know, somebody might throw an insult here and there and I may not even be paying attention to. Yeah. Whatever. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=556.0s)]
*  Whereas if I'm not, I'm totally paying attention to that and it escalates and it's going to escalate. Yeah, which is the worst because a lot of us that are high, strong without it, man, it sort of grounds us out. Yeah. Yeah. In a good way. Exercise and and weed exercise. Great combination for being a peaceful, kind person. Absolutely. And good health. Yeah. And good health because weed keeps you young, man. Yeah. I mean, I'm not saying that's the only thing that's going to help you. Yeah. I mean, I think that's the only thing that's going to help you. Yeah. I mean, I think that's the only thing that's going to help you. Yeah. I mean, I think that's the only thing that's going to help you. Yeah. I mean, I think that's the only thing that's going to help you. Yeah. I mean, I think that's the only thing that's going to help you. Yeah. I mean, I think that [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=580.0s)]
*  I got to tell you. Well, it definitely keeps you relaxed, which can help you stay young. Yeah. At least give it give you a young mindset. Yeah. The stresses of life can age you. Yeah. It's just concentrate on the petty bullshit. It's just not worth it, man. It's not worth it. Yeah. You know, like we used to do mushrooms a lot. I told that I told a couple of stories when I was on the last time I was here. But, you know, it used to be a part of our journey. Man, like we'd get on stage, mushrooms and like, just go on stage, you know, go on stage and do a little bit of everything. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think that's the best way to go about it. Yeah. I mean, I think that's the best way to go about it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think that's the best way to go about it. Yeah. I mean, I think that's the best way [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=610.0s)]
*  on the ride. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=640.0s)]
*  After a while, I couldn't do it anymore. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=642.96s)]
*  I couldn't be on stage and be totally in the melt, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=644.98s)]
*  we call it, where it's above micro, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=649.72s)]
*  it's above moderate, you're a full melt, as they say. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=652.64s)]
*  And it was harder for me to be in front of people [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=656.96s)]
*  doing that because I had these issues deeply rooted [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=660.36s)]
*  that I was angry about and every time I got to that place, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=664.7s)]
*  that's what I'd focus on, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=668.16s)]
*  and I didn't wanna feel that ugliness. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=669.9599999999999s)]
*  So I waited till I got over whatever that issue was, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=671.74s)]
*  and then I started slowly doing mushrooms again, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=677.28s)]
*  microdosing first and then moderate, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=681.36s)]
*  and I started feeling good about it again, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=684.04s)]
*  and I realized how much it actually helped me push away [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=686.28s)]
*  from whatever that issue was when I did it the first time. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=690.6999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, just something you were focusing on, right? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=694.4399999999999s)]
*  You just needed to work out. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=696.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I often say, if you're gonna try mushrooms [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=698.88s)]
*  beyond micro, try to deal with whatever issues you got [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=701.48s)]
*  before you go in and have a friend there to help you, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=707.3000000000001s)]
*  like to be in the world there with you. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=710.48s)]
*  That's what everybody used to use, a sitter. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=712.8000000000001s)]
*  That was always the big thing. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=714.48s)]
*  If you did mushrooms, you should have a sitter. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=715.88s)]
*  In the best case scenario, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=720.08s)]
*  you would have qualified professionals [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=722.3000000000001s)]
*  that would assist in psychedelic therapy, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=724.46s)]
*  which is what happens for a lot of people. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=727.58s)]
*  I know people that have done that in other states [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=729.94s)]
*  where it's legal or illegal, and where it's legal, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=732.7s)]
*  it's amazing. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=736.58s)]
*  You can go to a place and someone who understands [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=737.4200000000001s)]
*  the experience and knows what to do [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=739.38s)]
*  can help you through it, and I know people [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=740.86s)]
*  that have made some big breakthroughs in their life [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=742.74s)]
*  and just really just sort of reassessed [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=744.72s)]
*  how they interface with the world because of that. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=747.3000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, man, if you could find something [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=749.9000000000001s)]
*  that would help you get past whatever is holding you back [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=753.0s)]
*  or troubling you, weighing you down, man, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=758.28s)]
*  I mean, better than taking any of these [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=761.44s)]
*  over-the-counter drugs for that [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=764.24s)]
*  that might suppress those feelings or thoughts [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=766.22s)]
*  than have you deal with them and get past them. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=769.6s)]
*  Yeah, well, that kind of thinking [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=771.76s)]
*  is why it's gonna stay illegal. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=773.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=775.2s)]
*  Because there's a lot of money to be lost [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=776.04s)]

*  over the years about the opiate crisis and the pill problem. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=816.7199999999999s)]

*  called the Oxycontin Express, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=827.0s)]
*  where she explained the pill mills in Florida [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=829.16s)]
*  and how people would buy the Oxy's [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=831.1999999999999s)]
*  and bring them up the highway to Kentucky [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=832.76s)]
*  and all these places. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=834.5999999999999s)]
*  And people had horrible addictions [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=835.4399999999999s)]
*  and horrible overdose stories. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=837.0s)]
*  It was all coming from Florida. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=839.1999999999999s)]
*  And there was no database. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=841.0799999999999s)]
*  So you could have a back, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=842.9599999999999s)]
*  ah, my back hurts. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=844.3199999999999s)]

*  oh, you need Oxycontin. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=846.3199999999999s)]
*  And literally go right next door at the same building [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=847.52s)]
*  and that's where they give you the Oxy [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=850.36s)]
*  and that's all they prescribe. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=851.68s)]
*  And they don't have a database. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=853.04s)]
*  So then you go down the street to another doctor [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=854.0799999999999s)]
*  because these pain management clinics were everywhere. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=855.8s)]
*  That seems like it's a thing in Florida. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=858.04s)]
*  It was. Yeah. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=860.8399999999999s)]
*  It was a thing in Florida. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=861.92s)]
*  They cleaned it up. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=863.0799999999999s)]
*  I mean, they had this- [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=863.92s)]
*  Allegedly. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=865.52s)]
*  They had this show called Claws, right? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=866.36s)]
*  That old girl that did Reno 911, Nisi Nash, right? [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=869.0s)]
*  She starred in this TV show called Claws. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=875.4399999999999s)]
*  And it's her and a group of women trying to come up [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=879.7199999999999s)]
*  in a salon, like make the best salon. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=885.04s)]
*  But the other way that they're making money [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=887.76s)]
*  is through the pills and through one of these type of, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=891.2399999999999s)]
*  you know, one of these type of clinics. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=896.48s)]
*  And it's basically showing you the game [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=898.76s)]
*  on how people are doing in Florida, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=900.72s)]
*  how these folks, this is like a thing out there. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=903.0s)]
*  The pain management clinics and all that stuff [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=906.8000000000001s)]
*  with the Oxycontin, all that stuff. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=909.76s)]
*  What trips me out is it, you know, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=911.88s)]
*  this fentanyl thing, right? [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=914.64s)]
*  People know about it. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=917.0s)]
*  It's been out there, [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=918.44s)]
*  yet they'll still challenge themselves [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=920.12s)]
*  and try to party like the shit ain't present. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=923.96s)]
*  It's like the gamble they're taking with that. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=928.48s)]
*  It just blows my mind. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=930.44s)]
*  I think that hard drug addiction is a different thing. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=932.6s)]
*  I really think it's a different thing. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=936.44s)]
*  I haven't experienced it, but I have friends that have, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=937.92s)]
*  and they get scared like they got captured by a demon. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=941.4s)]
*  And when they get clean, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=944.72s)]
*  they don't wanna fuck around with nothing. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=946.04s)]
*  They're like, dude, you don't understand. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=948.04s)]
*  I got captured by a demon. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=949.52s)]
*  And it's kind of, if you wonder, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=951.52s)]
*  what do people talk about, like demonic possession? [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=953.96s)]
*  That was always a thing back in the day. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=957.32s)]
*  Before, you know, people really had an understanding [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=959.52s)]
*  of human psychology and myths and lores [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=962.76s)]
*  and what people are terrified of. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=967.2s)]
*  Demonic possession was a real thing. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=968.9200000000001s)]
*  But if you think about what happens to someone [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=971.5600000000001s)]
*  when they get really hooked on meth, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=973.52s)]
*  I mean, how much different is that [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=976.36s)]
*  than being captured by a demon? [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=977.8000000000001s)]
*  You're captured by a chemical demon. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=979.64s)]
*  It's ruining your life. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=982.12s)]

*  Wild shit. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=988.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a chemical demon. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=989.1999999999999s)]
*  It does possess you. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=991.3199999999999s)]
*  I mean, like, look, when people were doing [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=992.4s)]
*  the PCP thing back in the day, right? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=994.52s)]
*  You know, back in Southgate when Sed and I were like, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=998.04s)]
*  you know, younger before we were, you know, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1001.92s)]
*  while we were in demo stages, right? [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1005.52s)]
*  Doing our demos and stuff like that. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1007.48s)]
*  We'd, you know, trek around the city, you know, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1009.2s)]
*  like go to parties and stuff like that. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1011.5600000000001s)]
*  House parties, if you will. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1013.5200000000001s)]
*  And every now and then, you know, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1015.6400000000001s)]
*  because we were broke-ass bastards, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1017.8000000000001s)]
*  we didn't always have cars. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1019.48s)]
*  We'd be walking to the parties and stuff like that [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1020.76s)]
*  for, you know, Cyprus or whatever. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1022.96s)]
*  And every now and then, you would come across [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1025.68s)]
*  a couple of, you know, gangsters that were PCP'd out. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1028.64s)]
*  And these dudes, I mean, like, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1033.64s)]
*  if you got into some shit with them, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1035.8s)]
*  you were dealing with someone who didn't know [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1038.12s)]
*  their strength and their abilities at that point. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1039.8s)]
*  Yeah, they would break handcuffs. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1042.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they would break handcuffs. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1043.8s)]
*  We've seen, like, so. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1044.84s)]
*  Is that real? [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1046.52s)]
*  Did people really break handcuffs on PCP [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1047.36s)]
*  or is that one of those myths? [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1049.1999999999998s)]
*  Well, they. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1050.72s)]
*  Because I had always heard that people did that. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1051.56s)]
*  They could definitely break windows like nothing. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1052.3999999999999s)]
*  They do wild shit. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1054.9199999999998s)]
*  Do wild shit. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1056.12s)]
*  So there was this kid in Southgate who was, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1057.24s)]
*  he was a gang banger. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1059.52s)]
*  And a lot of other people in the area, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1061.6399999999999s)]
*  they didn't wanna fuck with him [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1064.3799999999999s)]
*  because him and his brother were kinda crazy, right? [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1065.48s)]
*  And they had, like, reputations. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1068.8s)]
*  And there was another contingency of gangsters [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1070.4s)]
*  that wanted to get at him, right? [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1074.28s)]
*  So this guy was sitting on his porch one day by himself. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1076.08s)]
*  His brothers and the rest of his guys [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1079.88s)]
*  were not there with him. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1082.32s)]
*  He was outside of his mother's house chilling. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1083.16s)]
*  And these dudes roll up on him with a shotgun [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1086.28s)]
*  and they blast him. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1089.68s)]
*  They, you know, buck-shotted him, you know, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1091.08s)]
*  in his stomach, all that. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1094.8s)]
*  And they take off. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1097.08s)]
*  They leave him there for dead. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1099.84s)]
*  That's what was the intention, right? [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1101.6s)]
*  And this dude was on PCP at the time. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1104.28s)]
*  They did not know he was on PCP. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1107.54s)]
*  Nobody knew until the paramedics came, got him. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1109.52s)]
*  And that's what, that, oddly enough, is what saved him [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1113.6s)]
*  is that he didn't go into shock. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1116.56s)]
*  He was just like, whoa. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1118.28s)]
*  You know, like. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1121.56s)]
*  Wow. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1123.28s)]
*  He was slowed down and possessed by the PCP [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1124.12s)]
*  or whatever the hell he was on. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1128.8s)]
*  And he lived through that, you know? [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1131.76s)]
*  And it wasn't like, it was a short distance [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1134.2399999999998s)]
*  that they blasted him with. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1136.8799999999999s)]
*  All them buck shots. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1138.1599999999999s)]
*  I mean, it had to be painful. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1140.0s)]
*  But he didn't feel a goddamn thing, apparently. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1142.02s)]
*  And he felt it the next day, obviously. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1144.9599999999998s)]
*  But he lived through that while he was on the PCP. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1147.6399999999999s)]
*  And that's crazy. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1151.1999999999998s)]
*  Because is it good for you? [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1152.72s)]
*  Well, because he's had a big conspiracy, PCP. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1154.48s)]
*  Well, I would say that had he not been on it, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1156.96s)]
*  he would have went into shock [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1159.1200000000001s)]
*  and sure enough died right there on that porch. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1160.32s)]
*  Wow. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1162.76s)]
*  But that's. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1163.72s)]
*  Imagine if that becomes a thing. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1164.56s)]
*  Like it turns out to be true that if you're on PCP [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1166.28s)]
*  when you get wounded, you're more likely to survive. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1168.28s)]
*  That would be crazy. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1170.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1171.44s)]
*  What is that elevated state? [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1172.28s)]
*  Isn't PCP, isn't it related to ketamine in some way? [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1174.0s)]
*  Didn't someone say that on the podcast [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1178.88s)]
*  and it freaked us out? [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1180.88s)]
*  Oh, like it was one chemo, like one. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1183.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's really related, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1184.8s)]
*  like real close to ketamine or something. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1186.88s)]
*  Some guys used to smoke and bought, [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1188.8s)]
*  like they might dip their joints or cigarettes [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1190.28s)]
*  in embalming food. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1192.76s)]
*  Shurm. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1193.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, shurm. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1194.42s)]
*  That was another zombie deal right there. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1195.26s)]
*  Ketamine and phenylside, PCP study, yeah. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1198.44s)]
*  Ketamine and fenside, I'm sorry, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1202.72s)]
*  slide dye. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1207.76s)]
*  If I was a fucking scientist, [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1208.6000000000001s)]
*  I'd be so mad at this podcast. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1209.84s)]
*  Yeah, he was either on- [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1211.32s)]
*  Fensiclidine. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1212.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he was either on PCP or shurm, one of the two. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1213.56s)]
*  It says, they're both, it says, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1216.52s)]
*  are N-methyl-D-aspart receptor antagonists [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1219.24s)]
*  and disassociate anesthetics that can cause intoxication, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1223.6799999999998s)]
*  sometimes can cut, sometimes can fuse. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1228.0s)]
*  So it seems like it's similar. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1230.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1232.56s)]
*  Is that what they're saying, Jamie? [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1233.6799999999998s)]
*  If not, the- [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1235.08s)]
*  They're both in the same family. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1236.12s)]
*  Ketamine story begins with a drug called PCP, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1238.84s)]
*  PS.PCP. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1241.6000000000001s)]
*  So maybe it's like the proper form of it made in a lab. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1242.64s)]
*  So I had a boxing coach back in Boston, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1247.32s)]
*  and he was a savage. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1250.0s)]
*  This dude was a longshoreman. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1251.56s)]
*  I don't wanna say his name [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1253.42s)]
*  because I don't wanna tell the whole story. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1254.26s)]
*  But he was a wild dude, especially when he was young, [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1255.76s)]
*  and he was a really good boxer. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1261.32s)]
*  And he got in a street fight [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1263.96s)]
*  and got his fucking finger bitten off. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1265.16s)]
*  So his index finger on his right hand was missing, [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1267.8799999999999s)]
*  and he had it replaced with his fucking toe. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1272.08s)]
*  This is how gangster this dude was. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1275.0s)]
*  He had his toe removed, not the big toe, but the second one. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1276.6799999999998s)]
*  And the toe was his new finger, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1280.52s)]
*  and he had it curved so he could throw right hooks. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1282.84s)]
*  Oh, man. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1285.6799999999998s)]
*  So when you shook his hand, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1286.52s)]
*  you always got a curved finger [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1287.9199999999998s)]
*  because this finger was immobile. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1290.28s)]
*  It could just kinda clamp down, [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1292.04s)]
*  but he could still throw punches. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1293.8s)]
*  He had it curved so he could make a fist. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1295.32s)]
*  He was like, we could leave it open, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1298.4399999999998s)]
*  and he's like, no, no, no, fuck that. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1299.28s)]
*  I wanna be able to crack people. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1300.7199999999998s)]
*  So his toe was his right finger, [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1302.6799999999998s)]
*  and he goes, I don't even remember what happened. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1304.9599999999998s)]
*  He was on PCP, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1306.3999999999999s)]
*  and then he got his finger bitten off in a street fight. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1307.76s)]
*  And I'm like, what is PCP like? [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1310.56s)]
*  He's like, whew. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1312.08s)]
*  To the moon. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1314.4199999999998s)]
*  Ain't nothing like we experienced with this weed. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1316.0s)]
*  I'm not fucking even thinking about trying that, [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1318.48s)]
*  whatever that is. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1321.28s)]
*  I don't want it. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1322.12s)]
*  But if ketamine's next door neighbors to that, [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1322.9599999999998s)]
*  that's what's crazy because I know a lot of people [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1324.84s)]
*  did ketamine and they did sensory deprivation tanks [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1328.3s)]
*  on ketamine. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1330.78s)]
*  That was what John Lilly used to do apparently. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1331.7s)]
*  And what'd that do for him? [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1335.38s)]
*  I don't know, man. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1337.42s)]
*  The way I've heard about ketamine is, [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1339.06s)]
*  it's only a bunch of different descriptions, [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1342.8600000000001s)]
*  but people say, [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1344.66s)]
*  they do IV-assisted ketamine for depression, [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1347.98s)]
*  and Neil Brennan did it. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1350.92s)]
*  Neil Brennan, the comedian. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1352.06s)]
*  Neil, who's a hilarious and interesting dude, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1353.46s)]
*  so he's the perfect guy to, he can describe this. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1356.66s)]
*  He's trying to figure out what's wrong with him, [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1360.18s)]
*  why is he depressed. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1361.9s)]
*  So he tries this ketamine therapy. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1362.9s)]
*  He's like, oh, it'll probably be something. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1364.14s)]
*  You lay there and you get a little dose of this [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1366.42s)]
*  and you relax or something. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1368.26s)]
*  They're like, no. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1369.38s)]
*  He goes, I was tripping my fucking balls off. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1370.74s)]
*  I go, really? [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1373.98s)]
*  And I forget his description of it, [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1375.14s)]
*  but I remember Terrence McEnnis. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1376.66s)]
*  He said it's like you're in an alien office building, [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1378.22s)]
*  but there's no one in the office building. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1381.66s)]
*  You're wandering around. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1383.6200000000001s)]
*  But I've heard a bunch of different, [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1386.02s)]
*  weirder, even more strange descriptions [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1387.58s)]
*  of people that go into K-holes. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1390.42s)]
*  Couple interesting things to read in here. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1391.94s)]
*  What does it say? [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1393.98s)]
*  Well, it's very similar to PCP, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1395.22s)]
*  but it's got a lot, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1398.3s)]
*  when it was chemically synthesized in the 60s, [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1399.58s)]
*  they took out the convulsion and seizure stuff [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1401.7s)]
*  that would happen to people. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1404.26s)]
*  Well, that's good. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1405.26s)]
*  Jesus Christ. That's great. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1406.1s)]
*  Jesus Christ. Thank you. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1407.82s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1409.66s)]
*  But at the bottom, it says that it's sedative, [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1410.5s)]
*  and in fact, it was given to that boy, Socrates, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1412.94s)]
*  when he was trapped in the cave in Thailand. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1416.1399999999999s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1417.1799999999998s)]
*  To put him in a tranquilized state, [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1418.02s)]
*  so they would be easier to move. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1418.86s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1420.1399999999999s)]
*  Oh my God, that's so insane. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1422.4199999999998s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1424.1799999999998s)]
*  So they were pretty much loose. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1425.02s)]
*  Yeah, they put him on ketamine [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1427.1799999999998s)]
*  to get him through the tunnel. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1428.74s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1430.22s)]
*  Wow, that so makes sense though. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1431.3s)]
*  Yeah, I would imagine, [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1432.9399999999998s)]
*  because if you got any issues about, [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1433.9399999999998s)]
*  you know, like you're claustrophobic. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1436.74s)]
*  If those kids panicked and freaked out [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1438.74s)]
*  while they were swimming him through. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1440.6599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, stuck. Oh my God. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1441.98s)]
*  Done. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1443.54s)]
*  There's an article I found from 1991 LA Times [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1444.38s)]
*  that's describing some myths about PCP. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1446.9s)]
*  What's the big myth? [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1449.74s)]
*  Does it have anything about handcuff breaking? [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1450.94s)]
*  Well, it says- [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1453.5s)]
*  Dudes can break handcuffs, right? [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1454.3400000000001s)]
*  You always heard that, right? [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1456.5400000000002s)]
*  There's a lot of anecdotes for sure of them saying [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1457.5s)]
*  that they would break their bones [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1460.42s)]
*  and do things that they wouldn't feel [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1462.46s)]
*  because it was such a powerful anesthetic [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1463.7800000000002s)]
*  that they wouldn't feel shit till it wore off. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1465.74s)]
*  Yeah, you're numb basically. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1467.2600000000002s)]
*  But this also says that there's myths that were created [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1468.98s)]
*  to change, that apparently those myths were used [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1471.18s)]
*  to change some laws. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1473.42s)]
*  Like for instance, cocaine, it says a myth [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1474.46s)]
*  that made blacks most unaffected by, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1477.66s)]
*  cocaine made blacks unaffected by 32 caliber bullets [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1480.7s)]
*  is said to have caused Southern police departments [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1483.74s)]
*  to switch to 38 caliber revolvers. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1485.8600000000001s)]
*  What? [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1487.74s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1488.8600000000001s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1489.7s)]
*  And so there's this thing about PCP that says [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1490.54s)]
*  if people believe that it would make them, [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1491.8600000000001s)]
*  they believe the public will go along with use of any force [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1496.14s)]
*  to make the claim that the person [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1499.0600000000002s)]
*  was under the influence of PCP. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1500.14s)]
*  That it's so dangerous that any means to subdue. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1502.3400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, any means to subdue. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1505.02s)]
*  Isn't it interesting? [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1506.18s)]
*  They decide what caliber you should be able [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1508.8600000000001s)]
*  to kill people with. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1511.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1512.8600000000001s)]
*  Well this ain't big enough. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1514.26s)]
*  We need to go bigger. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1515.54s)]
*  It's almost like they're saying, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1516.46s)]
*  give someone a chance to just get wounded. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1517.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1520.14s)]
*  You might just get wounded. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1521.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1523.26s)]
*  But they're shooting at you. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1524.26s)]
*  It was crazy is that they're saying that [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1525.38s)]
*  this drug makes them not necessarily superhuman, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1529.06s)]
*  but not as vulnerable. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1536.58s)]
*  Not as vulnerable. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1537.6599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1538.5s)]
*  And it is true to a degree. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1539.34s)]
*  I would imagine if you're hopped up on meth, [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1540.98s)]
*  you'd probably be really hard to take down. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1542.86s)]
*  You'd just be like a wild animal, like a wild cat. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1545.02s)]
*  Yeah, it would take. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1547.26s)]
*  Yeah, you're ripping your body apart, resisting. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1548.98s)]
*  You don't even realize the limitations of your tissue. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1551.02s)]
*  You're just ripping your knees apart [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1553.9399999999998s)]
*  and just fucking going crazy. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1555.5s)]
*  I mean, you don't give a shit. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1556.78s)]
*  So when we were spending a lot of time in Southgate [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1558.38s)]
*  before we eventually start touring and moving around [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1563.22s)]
*  and being a part of the industry [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1567.74s)]
*  more than being in the streets, right? [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1570.42s)]
*  Just before that, we used to hang out at this spot [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1572.54s)]
*  in Southgate at this jack-in-the-box. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1576.94s)]
*  For some reason, everybody went there. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1580.02s)]
*  It was on Firestone in California. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1582.26s)]
*  And City Hall is just down the street [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1584.82s)]
*  and Southgate Police Department is just right there. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1586.94s)]
*  And we just happened to be there on this day [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1589.34s)]
*  where they were trying to take down this dude [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1590.98s)]
*  that was probably like 6'2", 6'3", [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1593.42s)]
*  Kenny Loggins-looking motherfucker. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1596.62s)]
*  You know, scraggly beard. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1598.26s)]
*  And he's got his shirt off, no shoes. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1600.62s)]
*  He's just in his jeans. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1602.86s)]
*  And there's like 10 Southgate police officers [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1604.22s)]
*  trying to subdue this guy. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1608.86s)]
*  And they could just not. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1610.5s)]
*  They had to call like five or six more. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1612.22s)]
*  And they put him in the back of the police car. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1615.18s)]
*  And with his bare feet, he kicks out the window. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1619.6200000000001s)]
*  And they're like, they are really dealing with this guy. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1622.3400000000001s)]
*  This dude was huge. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1625.22s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1627.14s)]
*  Yeah, he had to have been on something [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1629.5800000000002s)]
*  because he wasn't very big, big. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1631.8600000000001s)]
*  He was tall, but he was kind of lanky. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1635.02s)]
*  But man, he was tossing those dudes around like nothing. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1637.0600000000002s)]
*  Well, there's some dudes [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1640.46s)]
*  that are just genetically freak strong. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1641.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1644.1000000000001s)]
*  You know, like our buddy Jeff out there. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1644.94s)]
*  Jeff doesn't even work out. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1647.42s)]
*  And there's this grip thing that you grab [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1649.26s)]
*  and he beats all of us. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1651.46s)]
*  Everybody works out every day. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1652.94s)]
*  He grabs his thing. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1653.98s)]
*  It's like, got that inner strength. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1654.8200000000002s)]
*  Just got natural strength. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1656.94s)]
*  Some people just have better genes than us. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1659.0600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and imagine that guy on PCP. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1660.78s)]
*  Oh my goodness. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1664.94s)]
*  You're not gonna hold him down. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1665.78s)]
*  He's barefoot and he looks like Kenny Loggins. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1666.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1668.78s)]
*  He's got some country strength. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1669.86s)]
*  He's got country strength, bro. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1671.58s)]
*  For real. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1673.7s)]
*  Bro, those guys that work on farms, [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1674.54s)]
*  that is 100% legit. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1675.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1677.98s)]
*  When you think about hay bales, [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1678.82s)]
*  that's just like doing kettlebells all day. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1679.66s)]
*  Well, look, they even suggested that this was like [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1681.46s)]
*  hard shit when they made Rocky do it in Rocky IV. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1686.86s)]

*  when mixed with psilocybin? [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1965.94s)]
*  Google that. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1967.42s)]
*  Because there's gotta be some stuff like MAO inhibitors [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1968.5800000000002s)]
*  and stuff that would make you lose your fucking marbles. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1971.3s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1974.78s)]
*  Like McKenna told some story once [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1975.6200000000001s)]
*  about he took some sort of an MAO inhibitor [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1977.66s)]
*  and mushrooms at the same time [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1982.18s)]
*  and he almost lost his mind. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1983.94s)]
*  I believe that was the combination he was talking about. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1986.02s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1988.1000000000001s)]
*  But it was just way too much. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1988.94s)]
*  And it took him a while before he could sort of, [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1991.6599999999999s)]
*  the way he was describing it was much more eloquent [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1994.4199999999998s)]
*  but he was like talking about how he was trying [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1996.26s)]
*  to reformulate reality essentially. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=1997.8999999999999s)]
*  It wasn't. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2002.4599999999998s)]
*  It went deep. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2003.3s)]
*  Yeah he was like gone. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2004.1399999999999s)]
*  Like oh my god I'm never coming back gone. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2004.9799999999998s)]
*  And then it just took a while and then eventually. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2008.3s)]
*  There's stories of him and his brother, [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2010.4599999999998s)]
*  they took mushrooms in the Amazon [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2012.9799999999998s)]
*  and they found these fresh mushrooms [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2015.3s)]
*  and the brother went way, way, way too hard. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2017.26s)]
*  He went way too hard. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2020.2199999999998s)]
*  His brother Dennis. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2022.1799999999998s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2023.02s)]
*  And he was gone for weeks. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2023.86s)]
*  He was gone for weeks, for weeks. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2025.86s)]
*  Yeah some folks don't come back from that [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2027.74s)]
*  as quickly as others and some people stay. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2030.34s)]
*  Some people stay. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2032.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2033.82s)]
*  If you're like prone to like having mental issues already [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2034.6599999999999s)]
*  it's probably not a good idea to do it. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2039.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2040.78s)]
*  Not without a guide. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2041.62s)]
*  Not without a guide. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2042.5s)]
*  And even then like probably you should just do a little. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2043.34s)]
*  Yeah moderate. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2045.82s)]
*  Yeah I mean I'm not a doctor clearly. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2046.6599999999999s)]
*  Don't take my advice on anything. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2049.2599999999998s)]
*  But in that regard I would say like what they did was wild. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2051.7s)]
*  They just ate a pile of them. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2056.94s)]
*  Like who knows how much it was. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2059.94s)]
*  And there's like fresh mushrooms in the Amazon [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2061.1s)]
*  and he was apparently just fucking gone. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2063.18s)]
*  People are going extra hard on the mushrooms as of late. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2066.86s)]
*  Like you know we talk about it [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2070.46s)]
*  on the Dr. Green Thumb show right. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2072.66s)]
*  And we were talking about you know what, [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2074.54s)]
*  one day we're gonna do a micro dose before we go on. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2076.3s)]
*  Or a moderate dose right. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2080.74s)]
*  And we did that. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2082.22s)]
*  And everything was fucking hilarious to us right. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2083.8599999999997s)]
*  After that show we started seeing like some of the fans [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2087.8199999999997s)]
*  and like yo this is what I'm doing today right. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2091.1s)]
*  And they'll send us like the shake prep if you will. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2094.02s)]
*  They'll do them in shakes right. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2099.4199999999996s)]
*  And they'll take a pile of mushrooms [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2100.74s)]
*  and grind them up in that shake. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2103.62s)]
*  And we're like damn you ain't coming back for a week. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2105.1s)]
*  Cause it's like you know back in the day [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2108.46s)]
*  we used to do like an eighth before we went on stage. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2110.42s)]
*  We'd take an eighth of mushrooms. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2113.54s)]
*  And that was a lot for that time. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2114.82s)]
*  But like people are doing like double that. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2116.5s)]
*  We're like whoa. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2118.78s)]
*  You guys ain't. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2121.9s)]
*  You're floating around in an alternative reality. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2122.7400000000002s)]
*  You're going into the portal. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2124.7s)]
*  Yeah you're into the portal and then you're interacting [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2126.66s)]
*  with the material world while you're in the portal. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2128.86s)]
*  Yeah and that's the hard part. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2131.42s)]
*  If you're around like minded people like everybody took [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2133.26s)]
*  and it's closed off to the world [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2136.98s)]
*  and you guys are right there it's fine. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2139.7400000000002s)]
*  But it's always the one person that might not be [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2142.46s)]
*  in the world with you in that way. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2146.2200000000003s)]
*  And they might throw the whole damn thing off. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2148.5s)]
*  Yeah that can happen. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2151.1s)]
*  Cause you're trying to relax. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2152.02s)]
*  And you see that someone's losing their shit. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2153.58s)]
*  Yeah or vice versa. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2156.06s)]
*  You could be like we're all totally here. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2157.78s)]
*  That person doesn't understand where we're at. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2161.02s)]
*  Cause he's not in it or she's not in it with us. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2163.54s)]
*  What's really important to me is it could help [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2167.14s)]
*  so many people like so many veterans. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2168.98s)]
*  Like so many people with PTSD. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2171.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2174.22s)]
*  So many people like my friend assault victims. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2175.46s)]
*  I think that there's a real potential that it can help. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2178.22s)]
*  But it's dangerous. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2181.7s)]
*  It's like everything where you're monkeying [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2183.22s)]
*  with your mind it's dangerous. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2185.02s)]
*  It shouldn't be treated lightly. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2186.2599999999998s)]
*  No. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2187.74s)]
*  It's real stuff. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2189.02s)]
*  Yeah absolutely. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2189.86s)]
*  I mean you know there's people that do it for you know [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2190.82s)]
*  casual use to you know just like someone smokes weed. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2195.82s)]
*  Not everybody smokes weed for the health benefit of it. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2200.06s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2203.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2204.34s)]
*  And it's the same thing with mushrooms. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2205.1800000000003s)]
*  Some people are partying with it. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2207.38s)]
*  And some people are trying to actually get you know [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2209.26s)]
*  a benefit from it in the way that it'll help them [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2212.86s)]
*  with whatever issue that they're having [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2216.78s)]
*  that they feel it could help for. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2218.9s)]
*  So you know I think there's a different sort [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2221.42s)]
*  of responsibility on each shoulder. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2224.18s)]
*  And I think the user knows that right. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2227.14s)]
*  So like if you're partying on it you know [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2229.3799999999997s)]
*  where your limits are. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2231.2599999999998s)]
*  When you're using it for medical use you're sort of like [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2232.8199999999997s)]
*  afraid to step on the gas. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2236.7s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2238.58s)]
*  So I think you go a little slowly in that aspect there. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2239.42s)]
*  You know. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2242.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2243.62s)]
*  Because I think people still are genuinely afraid of it [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2244.8199999999997s)]
*  because they don't know about it. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2247.3799999999997s)]
*  They've only ever heard and they're trying [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2248.7799999999997s)]
*  to experiment with it. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2250.8199999999997s)]
*  But that's when you need someone who's experienced in it [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2251.94s)]
*  who can actually guide you through. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2255.42s)]
*  So if you want to do a little bit more [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2256.94s)]
*  and get a little bit more of the experience [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2258.7400000000002s)]
*  or you want to pull back. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2260.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2262.02s)]
*  Because you know you always got the assholes more. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2262.86s)]
*  Do more. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2265.58s)]
*  And then also the other problem with it being illegal [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2266.7400000000002s)]
*  is some of the people that provide you [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2269.94s)]
*  that experience are weirdos. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2271.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2273.9s)]

*  to decipher the Dead Sea Scrolls. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2479.18s)]
*  So for 14 years this guy worked in the Dead Sea Scrolls [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2481.5s)]

*  The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2485.54s)]

*  came from an ancient Sumerian word [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2518.44s)]
*  that meant a mushroom covered in God's semen. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2520.36s)]
*  So people thought that when it rained [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2524.46s)]
*  it was God coming on the earth. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2526.94s)]

*  because you know how quick mushrooms are. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2531.5s)]

*  So of course they thought that this was, [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2537.3s)]

*  I don't know that I've seen that before. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2576.94s)]

*  That's where they grow. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2586.0600000000004s)]

*  How crazy is this? [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2591.34s)]
*  They used to give the cows an anti-fungal feed [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2592.68s)]
*  so that their shit couldn't grow mushrooms in them. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2597.2s)]
*  It was in Asheville, North Carolina. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2601.72s)]
*  And so many kids were going out there [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2603.6s)]
*  and just picking mushrooms off cow shit [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2605.24s)]
*  and just tripping their fucking balls off [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2606.8799999999997s)]
*  that they had to put a stop to it. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2609.16s)]

*  So they poisoned the cows. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2613.8399999999997s)]
*  They give this cow this anti-fungal shit. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2615.2799999999997s)]
*  I don't know if it poisoned the cow. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2617.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm just being hyperbolic. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2618.92s)]
*  But they gave the cow this anti-fungal shit [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2621.08s)]
*  so they couldn't do what it naturally does, [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2623.84s)]
*  which is makes the perfect habitat for psilocybin. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2625.68s)]
*  So they starved out all the magic mushrooms. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2628.2s)]
*  I don't even know if that worked. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2632.2799999999997s)]
*  Because that was what Duncan told me. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2633.52s)]
*  We should research. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2634.6s)]
*  That might be a total myth. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2635.72s)]
*  Even if it did, [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2637.72s)]
*  those kids found another way to get mushrooms. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2638.6s)]
*  Oh yeah, once they got them, they got them. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2641.2s)]
*  Yeah, there's so many ways to get any of that now. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2643.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, there's so many places though [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2647.16s)]
*  where it grows naturally still to this day. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2650.2s)]
*  It's a schedule one substance that just grows naturally. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2653.04s)]
*  You don't have to process it. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2655.72s)]
*  You don't have to do anything. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2657.2s)]
*  You just pick it and eat it. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2658.48s)]
*  And it's illegal, which is like, okay. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2659.9199999999996s)]
*  I think that'll change. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2662.56s)]
*  I mean, you see more acceptance of it as of late. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2663.6s)]
*  And the fact that they're willing to study it [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2667.6s)]
*  and talk about the actual good it's been doing [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2669.8799999999997s)]
*  in those studies. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2673.64s)]

*  It's just slow. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2677.8799999999997s)]

*  It's just always slow. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2680.24s)]
*  Like with cannabis, I mean, we all know [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2681.08s)]
*  it should have been legal like probably [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2682.3199999999997s)]
*  five, 10 years ago already. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2683.9599999999996s)]

*  where preconceived notions are very hard to let go. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2686.72s)]

*  they have them about drugs. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2693.12s)]

*  But drugs are a big one. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2696.48s)]
*  Because I've had my own preconceived notions [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2698.2799999999997s)]
*  about cannabis. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2700.24s)]
*  When I was a kid, I didn't really do anything. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2702.0s)]
*  I didn't party at all from the time when I was like 15 [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2704.3599999999997s)]
*  until I was like 21. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2707.4s)]
*  Because I was training and fighting and that's all I did. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2708.52s)]
*  So I was a nerd sort of. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2711.2400000000002s)]
*  I was like kind of like socially awkward. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2713.1600000000003s)]
*  And I thought that people who were getting high [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2715.8s)]
*  were just wasting their life. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2718.56s)]
*  They weren't gonna get nowhere. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2719.8s)]

*  And I thought that like weed was for losers. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2733.32s)]
*  Until I started hanging out with Eddie Bravo. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2735.8399999999997s)]
*  And Eddie Bravo and I were doing jujitsu together [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2737.64s)]

*  And he starts talking about how much weed [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2744.08s)]
*  influences his music. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2747.44s)]

*  I'm like, that's crazy. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2755.52s)]

*  He goes, no, no, no, no. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2757.9199999999996s)]

*  So we went, got high. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2763.48s)]

*  Like if I'm doing Concentrates, man, [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2847.9599999999996s)]
*  that's when it gets tough. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2849.76s)]
*  Like flour I got all day, you know, that's nothing for me. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2851.28s)]
*  But it's the Concentrates and like the RSO. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2854.28s)]
*  Have you done the RSO or the full spectrum hemp oil yet? [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2857.84s)]
*  I'm not fucking around with any of the things [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2862.5600000000004s)]
*  these kids are doing. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2864.48s)]
*  These dabsers, these kids were bringing dab machines [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2865.76s)]
*  everywhere they go. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2869.0800000000004s)]
*  They're in another dimension, man. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2870.1200000000003s)]
*  Ah man, it is crazy. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2871.76s)]
*  They're in the next door dimension. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2872.6000000000004s)]
*  They're not living with us right now. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2874.0s)]
*  They're in another place. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2875.36s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2876.32s)]
*  Because when they come to the show and stuff like that, [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2877.3999999999996s)]
*  some of them are very intimidated by that. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2881.3999999999996s)]
*  Like rappers most especially. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2884.68s)]
*  Rappers are intimidated by the dabs. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2886.64s)]
*  For real. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2889.8399999999997s)]
*  They'll smoke the blunts. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2891.12s)]
*  They'll smoke the joints. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2893.2799999999997s)]
*  But my, you know, my peers, they don't like doing the dabs, [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2895.16s)]
*  man, it's too strong for them. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2899.7599999999998s)]
*  It's too much. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2901.72s)]
*  It's too much. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2902.56s)]
*  It's too much for me. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2903.3999999999996s)]
*  For me, I got used to it. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2904.3199999999997s)]
*  Because I gotta be universal in my path [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2907.52s)]
*  in the stoner world, right? [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2910.6800000000003s)]
*  Because everybody's always trying to take my fucking head off. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2912.32s)]
*  So I have to be ready for it. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2915.6000000000004s)]
*  Because there was one time these guys from Weed Maps, [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2917.7200000000003s)]
*  they were doing a 420 show in Colorado. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2920.2000000000003s)]
*  And the dabs were new to us still. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2923.4s)]
*  And they weren't as clean yet. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2926.6400000000003s)]
*  And they were just new in the culture. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2928.84s)]
*  But not new to these guys, right? [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2930.96s)]
*  So we all go to my hotel room, [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2933.1600000000003s)]
*  because I know these guys and stuff like that. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2936.48s)]
*  But everybody's got their own dab rig, [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2938.4s)]
*  their own dab torch, and their own concentrates. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2941.16s)]
*  It's like they're Jedis of dabbing, right? [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2944.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2947.32s)]
*  So we start off with one, and it's a hot dab. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2948.16s)]
*  This is before we start doing the low temp dabs. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2951.16s)]
*  Like, you know, that means heating the nail [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2953.6s)]
*  and then letting it cool down for about 40 seconds [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2955.7200000000003s)]
*  and then taking the hit so it's not hot as fuck, right? [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2958.48s)]
*  This is when we're like heating the nail, [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2962.44s)]
*  let it cool down 10 seconds, [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2964.4s)]
*  and then go for it. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2967.04s)]
*  And man, that is the most devastating way [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2967.8799999999997s)]
*  you could do this, right? [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2969.7599999999998s)]
*  So I took three hits. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2970.7999999999997s)]
*  We all, a piece, took three hits, right? [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2973.7599999999998s)]
*  And there was probably about six or seven of us. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2976.4399999999996s)]
*  And after like 45 minutes, I called my boy over. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2979.24s)]
*  I said, get everybody the fuck out of here. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2984.2799999999997s)]
*  I need like a few minutes to gather myself. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2986.52s)]
*  Hey man. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2990.52s)]
*  Yeah, I had to meditate out of what [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2992.3199999999997s)]
*  I was feeling right then, right? [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2995.6s)]
*  And I still had a show to do later on. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=2997.68s)]
*  How many hours to the show? [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3000.48s)]
*  It was like maybe four hours to the show. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3001.6s)]
*  And I was still feeling it when we got to the show. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3003.8399999999997s)]
*  I was high as fuck, higher than I had been in a long time. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3006.48s)]
*  And none of those guys made it to the show. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3010.2s)]
*  They all went home and slept. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3013.4s)]
*  I went and did a fucking show, you know? [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3015.68s)]
*  But after that, that's when I decided, [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3019.04s)]
*  okay, well, I don't, you know, dabs ain't my thing, [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3021.12s)]
*  but I'm gonna keep up on it. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3023.96s)]
*  So that I don't get my fucking head taken off again. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3026.28s)]
*  And you know, so other rappers, you know, [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3028.88s)]
*  have gone through the same thing where it's like, you know, [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3032.48s)]
*  they either don't try it at all because of the way it looks. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3035.4s)]
*  The torch to the nail, you know, is very cracky to us. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3038.44s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3042.4s)]
*  So like a lot of them don't fuck with it that way, [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3043.2400000000002s)]
*  but some of them now and then will try. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3045.4s)]
*  And then they'll love the taste, [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3048.4s)]
*  but the high is so fucking extreme after that [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3049.8s)]
*  they don't want no part of it. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3053.52s)]
*  They'll just stick to the flower. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3054.6s)]
*  Rapper high levels are way higher [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3056.68s)]
*  than comedian high levels. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3060.8399999999997s)]
*  We smoke a lot. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3062.8399999999997s)]
*  Rappers smoke all day. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3063.72s)]
*  Like watching people like Snoop Dogg [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3066.6s)]
*  put down blunt after bump and roll him, [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3069.44s)]
*  roll him himself, spark him up, [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3072.92s)]
*  put down another one, roll another one, [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3075.68s)]
*  spark it up, Action Bronson. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3077.6s)]
*  How many joints did Action Bronson smoke on the show? [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3079.44s)]
*  He's an avid smoker. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3081.92s)]
*  I'll tell you what. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3083.2s)]
*  Eight, nine joints. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3084.12s)]
*  The one who's a monster like myself in that regard [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3085.32s)]
*  is Wiz Khalifa. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3090.32s)]
*  That guy can smoke weed all day. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3091.7599999999998s)]
*  He can do the concentrates. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3094.2s)]
*  He does the bong hits. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3095.52s)]
*  I don't do the bong hits too much anymore, [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3096.68s)]
*  but like the dabbing and that stuff I'll do. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3098.88s)]
*  But yeah, he smokes like a monster. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3101.96s)]
*  And he's the perfect argument against weed makes you lazy. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3105.04s)]
*  Yeah, no, because he's always doing something. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3108.88s)]
*  He's always doing something. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3111.4s)]
*  This guy's training Muay Thai. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3112.24s)]
*  He's practically a pro fucking bowler. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3114.88s)]
*  I mean, oh man, this dude and his partner, Chevy Woods, [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3117.48s)]
*  those two guys, they hit the lanes like crazy. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3122.48s)]
*  And they're fucking good. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3125.52s)]
*  I thought I was good. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3128.0s)]
*  Like I was good when I was a kid. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3129.16s)]
*  I'm okay now. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3131.2799999999997s)]
*  But when I saw them bowl, I said, [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3132.56s)]
*  if I'm gonna go at them, [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3134.6s)]
*  I'm gonna have to be like getting my role together [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3135.96s)]
*  for about six months before I try these guys [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3138.44s)]
*  because they're rolling high numbers up there. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3140.96s)]
*  Wow. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3143.88s)]
*  And they're doing that high as fuck. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3144.7200000000003s)]
*  They're not sober in their role. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3147.88s)]
*  In their role and sober, they're high as fuck [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3149.6000000000004s)]
*  going in there getting some good numbers, man. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3151.6000000000004s)]
*  I'll be like, okay, Woods. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3154.56s)]
*  That makes sense because bowling is a feel thing. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3155.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3158.96s)]
*  It makes sense that you would like a better feeling [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3160.44s)]
*  of where the ball's gonna go if you're high. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3162.84s)]
*  For me, any physical activity when you're stoned, [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3164.32s)]
*  when you're an avid stoner, right? [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3167.84s)]
*  To me, it puts you in a zone [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3170.04s)]
*  where you can concentrate more on the shit you do. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3171.28s)]
*  So for instance, I do archery with my daughter. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3174.0800000000004s)]
*  And beforehand, I'll go smoke out before we go. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3177.6000000000004s)]
*  And I'll just be comfortable as opposed to [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3182.84s)]
*  when I've tried it when I wasn't. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3186.36s)]
*  And there's just something like it settles me in. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3188.6800000000003s)]
*  My targeting's better. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3192.0400000000004s)]
*  My breathing is better. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3193.52s)]
*  All that. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3195.6000000000004s)]
*  And even as it relates to workouts. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3196.44s)]
*  I feel like I could work out longer than if I'm... [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3198.76s)]
*  Like put it this way. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3203.1200000000003s)]
*  For example, if I'm not stoned, [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3204.48s)]
*  I'll set the time that I'm gonna work out, hour and a half. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3207.8s)]
*  And on that hour and a half, I'll stop. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3210.8s)]
*  But if I'm stoned, I'll lose myself in it [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3213.5600000000004s)]
*  and I'll go longer than that hour and a half. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3217.32s)]
*  And that's sort of what it does to me. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3220.48s)]
*  It just gives me that hyper focus where I'm just locked in. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3222.1600000000003s)]
*  When I'm stoned, I'm getting more information. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3225.72s)]
*  It feels like I'm more... [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3229.3999999999996s)]
*  When I'm doing physical things like martial arts, [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3231.52s)]
*  for example, when I'm stoned, I feel like my timing better. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3234.7599999999998s)]
*  I feel like when I'm supposed to move [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3239.04s)]
*  into something better. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3242.24s)]
*  I've had breakthroughs in technique from being high [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3243.52s)]
*  and hitting the bag because you realize [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3247.3999999999996s)]
*  there's just a perfect timing to the way it impacts. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3250.24s)]
*  You're a martial artist. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3254.72s)]
*  I think it slows you down and allows you to not rush into... [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3255.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, to do it properly. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3262.3199999999997s)]
*  To do it properly. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3263.9199999999996s)]
*  Yeah, it makes you feel the technique. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3264.7599999999998s)]
*  You feel your body moving in a little bit more harmony [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3266.9199999999996s)]
*  because sometimes when I'm not warmed up [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3270.9599999999996s)]
*  or maybe I'm a little sore or something like that, [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3273.3199999999997s)]
*  you can kind of force things the wrong way [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3277.12s)]
*  and you can even hurt yourself doing that. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3279.3999999999996s)]
*  But when you're high, you almost feel the way your muscles... [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3282.52s)]
*  When you do chin-ups when you're high, [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3286.0s)]
*  it's like you feel your back. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3287.36s)]
*  You feel everything in it. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3289.1200000000003s)]
*  It just makes everything very hypersensitive. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3290.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I always felt like when I went into the dojo, [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3292.84s)]
*  when I was training, [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3295.36s)]
*  when I went in sober, there was always this anxiety [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3298.6400000000003s)]
*  trying to do it all right and doing too much, [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3302.7200000000003s)]
*  trying to go faster than you actually should [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3308.56s)]
*  in your progression and being too excitable [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3313.68s)]
*  and stuff like that. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3317.24s)]
*  Whereas when I went in high, I would absorb it, [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3318.12s)]
*  like you said, absorb it more and focus on everything [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3321.12s)]
*  that I was doing from the snap of the punches [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3324.7999999999997s)]
*  to the blocks and kicks and all that stuff. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3328.7999999999997s)]
*  Instead of rushing it and trying to go out [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3331.6s)]
*  and impress sensei or all that that you do [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3334.44s)]
*  because ego comes in as well when you're in a dojo. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3338.76s)]
*  I wanna be the best student in here. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3341.88s)]
*  It's almost like a competition sometimes, right? [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3344.2400000000002s)]
*  But when I'd go in stone, I wouldn't even think about that. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3347.4s)]
*  It was just all about absorbing what he was given to us [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3350.52s)]
*  that day and then trying to do it [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3353.6s)]
*  and slowing my mind down to do it right. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3356.52s)]
*  Yeah, you know what really helps? [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3359.52s)]
*  Stretching. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3361.4s)]
*  Yeah, stretching, yeah. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3362.2400000000002s)]
*  When you stretch when you're high, [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3364.7999999999997s)]
*  you're releasing things. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3366.52s)]
*  You're like. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3367.8399999999997s)]
*  High yoga. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3368.68s)]
*  Yeah, high yoga. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3370.2s)]
*  Well, that was apparently what a lot [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3371.7599999999998s)]
*  of the ancient yogis used to do. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3374.08s)]
*  They used to take hashish. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3375.8799999999997s)]
*  Hashish, yeah. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3377.7599999999998s)]
*  They would take hashish and get into these funky poses, [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3378.6s)]
*  which makes sense. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3381.08s)]
*  If you were high as fuck and you're all doing. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3381.92s)]
*  That's what you'd do. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3384.68s)]
*  That's what you'd do. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3385.68s)]
*  If you were fucking high as fuck on hash, stand there. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3386.8799999999997s)]
*  I would do it. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3390.7999999999997s)]
*  I mean, sometimes I'll meditate [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3392.72s)]
*  and I'll be high as fuck when I'm meditating. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3395.44s)]
*  That allows me to go longer. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3397.52s)]
*  Because sometimes, I'm a Gemini and if I'm not high, man, [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3399.9199999999996s)]
*  I'm high strong and I try to rush through shit. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3403.0s)]
*  So if I mean to meditate for 10 minutes [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3408.44s)]
*  and I'm not stoned before I do it, [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3412.52s)]
*  I'll be trying to rush the meditation. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3415.3199999999997s)]
*  I'm looking at the time, is it 10 minutes yet? [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3417.3999999999996s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3420.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3421.04s)]
*  If I get stoned, I'm not even looking at the watch. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3421.88s)]
*  I'm just. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3423.92s)]
*  You're in it. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3424.76s)]
*  You're just in it. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3425.6s)]
*  Yeah, time flies. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3426.44s)]
*  You don't even recognize it. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3427.28s)]
*  If you were that high, I mean, [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3429.4s)]
*  have you ever taken a yoga class high? [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3431.28s)]
*  Like really high? [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3434.04s)]
*  Like hashish high? [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3435.6s)]
*  Hashish high, no. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3437.44s)]
*  Neither have I. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3438.88s)]
*  I've taken a yoga class mildly high and it was great. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3439.76s)]
*  It was amazing. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3444.0s)]
*  But I would imagine if you were hashish high [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3444.92s)]
*  and you're eating nothing but lentils [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3447.4s)]
*  and you're on this like vegan diet [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3450.24s)]
*  and just every day home. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3452.4399999999996s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3454.12s)]
*  Every day stretching, every day doing it. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3454.9599999999996s)]
*  You're probably tripping balls. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3456.64s)]
*  You're tripping balls. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3458.52s)]
*  Tripping balls. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3459.3599999999997s)]
*  And you're healing yourself too [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3460.3599999999997s)]
*  while you're tripping those balls. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3462.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3463.7999999999997s)]
*  That would be a fascinating person to talk to. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3465.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3468.0s)]
*  There's plenty of them out there, man. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3469.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3470.7999999999997s)]
*  Especially these new age yogis, man. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3471.7999999999997s)]
*  Those dudes, they would be like rappers too. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3474.04s)]
*  They try to smoke your head off. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3476.3199999999997s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3477.7999999999997s)]
*  They're definitely. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3478.64s)]
*  How many chillums can you smoke? [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3479.52s)]
*  That was like a thing with these. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3480.8s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3482.04s)]
*  These dudes. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3484.12s)]
*  These yogis. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3484.96s)]
*  Yeah, you know, that's the thing. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3486.88s)]
*  When you're known for something like that, man, [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3488.4s)]
*  they're trying to test. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3490.28s)]
*  People coming for you. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3491.12s)]
*  Oh, they are coming. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3492.04s)]
*  Kinnisono used to talk about that with cocaine. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3493.44s)]
*  He would say that when he would go to a party, [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3496.6s)]
*  they'd go, it's him, it's him. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3498.64s)]
*  And they'd put this giant line out. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3500.36s)]
*  Oh man. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3501.96s)]
*  And he'd go, and I just have to fucking, fucking get through. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3502.8s)]
*  So he would snort the line and almost have a heart attack. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3505.48s)]
*  Hilarious bit. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3508.32s)]
*  Oh man, you can't do that shit today. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3509.72s)]
*  That's for sure. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3510.7999999999997s)]
*  No. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3511.64s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3512.7599999999998s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3513.8399999999997s)]
*  I mean, this is the byproduct of illegality too. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3515.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3518.3999999999996s)]
*  I mean, that's how this happens. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3519.24s)]
*  If it's illegal, then it's unregulated. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3521.3599999999997s)]
*  If it's unregulated, sometimes there's poison in it. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3523.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3525.44s)]
*  And that's the problem, man. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3526.48s)]
*  That's the problem. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3527.48s)]
*  It's crazy, like going back to what we said in the beginning [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3528.8399999999997s)]
*  that people would even gamble knowing [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3532.16s)]
*  that that is a possibility. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3533.8799999999997s)]
*  Unless you know where it's coming from. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3535.52s)]
*  Do you think that this country could survive legalization [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3538.92s)]
*  of hard drugs like cocaine? [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3543.04s)]
*  Like what do you think, do you envision that that would, [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3545.28s)]
*  like we all want cannabis [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3547.96s)]
*  and it seems like cannabis is gonna happen. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3549.44s)]
*  It seems like it's on the way to happening. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3551.0s)]
*  I think you have to educate people more [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3553.04s)]
*  and be open to educate them properly [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3554.88s)]
*  instead of propaganda education [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3557.2400000000002s)]
*  where it's you're just telling them half truths [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3559.6s)]
*  to let them know what you want them to know. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3561.96s)]
*  Like in Europe, they're a little bit more with the shits [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3564.0s)]
*  in terms of how they deal with alcohol, [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3567.04s)]
*  how they deal with drugs, how they deal with nudity on TV, [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3572.88s)]
*  just things like that. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3576.16s)]
*  We are so uptight over here that we're afraid [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3578.36s)]
*  to teach people about these things [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3582.04s)]
*  because maybe that education will lead them there [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3583.72s)]
*  as opposed to like being upfront with them. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3588.88s)]
*  Like, look, this is what it is. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3591.44s)]
*  This is what happens. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3593.7599999999998s)]
*  And all the other shit instead of, [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3595.6s)]
*  hey, this over here, don't do it. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3598.08s)]
*  Well, the problem is everybody's finding out [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3600.48s)]
*  from everybody else. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3602.48s)]
*  Right. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3603.7999999999997s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3605.6s)]
*  You have to educate them properly. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3606.56s)]
*  You're not getting good information from your friends [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3608.4s)]
*  about how much molly you should take. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3610.64s)]
*  Right. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3612.12s)]
*  You can't let someone else educate them. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3612.96s)]
*  You have to be the one to do it [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3615.56s)]
*  and instead of the sheltering that we've gotten [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3616.96s)]
*  through most of our lives here, [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3619.6s)]
*  us growing up our generation, [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3621.68s)]
*  our parents didn't wanna tell us shit. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3623.16s)]
*  Don't do that. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3625.48s)]
*  Don't do that. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3626.32s)]
*  And sometimes they didn't know how to explain why. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3627.16s)]
*  Right. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3629.92s)]
*  But we are in a different place in different time [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3630.76s)]
*  where energy, I mean, information is vast [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3633.12s)]
*  and you can get it at the click of a finger, [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3637.04s)]
*  at a key on your computer, you know what I mean? [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3641.48s)]
*  You just gotta also take into account [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3643.92s)]
*  that people that live like us today, [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3645.96s)]
*  humans listening to this in 2023, [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3648.36s)]
*  this is a new type of person. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3651.08s)]
*  This is a new type of informed person. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3653.24s)]
*  People are so much more informed, [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3656.3999999999996s)]
*  even misinformed than they've ever been before. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3658.52s)]
*  You're dealing with an information overload [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3661.0s)]
*  that's never existed before. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3663.04s)]
*  And if you just go back a couple generations, [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3665.24s)]
*  like my grandparents came from Italy. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3668.4799999999996s)]
*  So we're talking about, they came over here [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3670.7599999999998s)]
*  during the Depression, they lived on a farm. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3674.4799999999996s)]
*  It was horrible, brutal shit in Italy. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3677.9599999999996s)]
*  They came over to America. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3681.3199999999997s)]
*  Those people that just got on a boat before YouTube [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3684.08s)]
*  and just made their way, [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3686.8399999999997s)]
*  they moved their whole family across the country, [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3687.92s)]
*  those are wild people, man. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3689.96s)]
*  That's wild. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3691.3199999999997s)]
*  And they were just trying to escape [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3692.16s)]
*  whatever the fuck was going on in Europe, [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3693.0s)]
*  which is probably even worse. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3694.16s)]
*  They're like, fuck it, I'll take a chance on a boat. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3695.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3696.96s)]
*  And then they got to America and they fucking sign up. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3697.7999999999997s)]
*  You could just be an American back then. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3700.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3701.68s)]
*  You could just show up and you were an American. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3702.52s)]
*  It's not like today where it's like [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3704.92s)]
*  these rigorous background checks. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3706.12s)]
*  Oh man. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3707.68s)]
*  Like back then, they just let immigrants in, right? [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3708.52s)]
*  What was it like to become an immigrant to America in 1920? [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3710.88s)]
*  I mean, did they turn anybody away? [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3714.88s)]
*  I don't think they turned anybody away, [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3717.0s)]
*  but they definitely put them through it. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3718.76s)]
*  Am I talking out of my ass? [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3721.28s)]
*  I mean, did they have an extensive thing that they do [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3722.44s)]
*  to let someone become an American citizen back then? [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3725.84s)]
*  It seems like it's hard today. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3729.08s)]
*  I think for some folks, they got put to work. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3730.44s)]
*  Yeah, you can come in here, [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3733.84s)]
*  but we need this and this and that, [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3735.04s)]
*  and you're gonna do that. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3738.04s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3739.48s)]
*  Have you been watching Yellowstone at all? [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3741.36s)]
*  Yes. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3743.1600000000003s)]
*  Have you watched the prequel, like the 1883, 19? [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3744.0s)]
*  I love Yellowstone though. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3747.04s)]
*  Oh man. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3748.2400000000002s)]
*  It's a great show. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3749.08s)]
*  Watch the prequel. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3750.04s)]
*  The prequel, 1883 is- [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3752.32s)]
*  I heard it's amazing. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3754.56s)]
*  Based off the Duttons coming from, I think, [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3755.76s)]
*  Tennessee or wherever, or Wyoming or something. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3758.04s)]
*  I think it's Tennessee, but them trying to get to Oregon, [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3760.2000000000003s)]
*  the original place they're trying to get to is Oregon, [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3763.48s)]
*  but they never make it there. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3766.8s)]
*  I won't blow the story. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3768.2400000000002s)]
*  They end up going to Montana, [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3770.24s)]
*  but seeing how they trekked from one side of the country [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3772.0s)]
*  to the other, and the shit they had to deal with [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3777.16s)]
*  from bandits all along those trails, [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3780.4s)]
*  and just the elements, man, [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3783.44s)]
*  coming into the country and having to go across it. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3785.64s)]
*  In the 1883 one, it's like they're going [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3789.68s)]
*  with a group of people. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3793.88s)]
*  It's not just their family. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3794.88s)]
*  They're going with a group of people [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3796.2799999999997s)]
*  that came from Germany, [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3799.36s)]
*  and they're trying to go to Oregon [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3800.76s)]
*  because there's free land there. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3802.4s)]
*  They don't have any money. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3804.1600000000003s)]
*  All they have is what they have with them [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3805.28s)]
*  that they brought from their prospective parts of Europe. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3808.1600000000003s)]
*  They're trying to get from wherever they're at to Oregon, [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3814.2400000000002s)]
*  and on the way, man, the shit that they go through. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3817.36s)]
*  It gives you that idea of what people [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3821.4s)]
*  were dealing with in that time. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3825.04s)]
*  We can't even imagine living like that, [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3827.72s)]
*  and that's the only way you could live. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3830.0s)]
*  That's the way people lived back then. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3831.92s)]
*  So what we're talking about today in 2023 [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3834.16s)]
*  is just a few generations removed from that. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3837.12s)]
*  I know it doesn't seem like it, [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3839.84s)]
*  but I had this joke that I used to do [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3841.64s)]
*  about the United States was founded in 1776. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3843.2s)]
*  People lived to be 100. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3847.48s)]
*  That's three people ago. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3848.7599999999998s)]
*  That's three people ago that were living like savages [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3850.56s)]
*  that brought slaves over on wooden boats [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3854.64s)]
*  powered by the wind, three people ago. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3857.24s)]
*  That's how recent civilization is [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3860.12s)]
*  in terms of what we enjoy today, [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3862.96s)]
*  this civilized view of the world, [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3865.3599999999997s)]
*  informed view of the world. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3868.3199999999997s)]
*  This is really recent. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3869.72s)]
*  It's evolved into something really different. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3872.6s)]
*  Very, very different. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3875.8799999999997s)]
*  I mean, it's gonna be a power struggle, [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3877.72s)]
*  and there's gonna be a lot of fucking weirdness [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3879.4s)]
*  when people try to dictate how you think and feel [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3882.04s)]
*  and what to do and what not to do, [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3884.16s)]
*  but at the end of the day, [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3885.56s)]
*  more people are being heard than ever before. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3886.64s)]
*  More people's voices are being heard than ever before. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3889.36s)]
*  More important issues are being raised [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3892.44s)]
*  that people weren't aware of. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3895.48s)]
*  More shit that you're not hearing about mainstream news. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3897.0s)]
*  It's really affecting your life, [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3899.4s)]
*  and you're finding out more about people. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3901.48s)]
*  There's way more information. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3903.4s)]
*  It's overall net positive. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3904.52s)]
*  It's just a rocky ass road. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3906.0s)]
*  For sure, with all these platforms, right? [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3907.44s)]
*  Before these platforms existed where you could be a voice, [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3910.04s)]
*  maybe you didn't intend to, [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3914.16s)]
*  but you became one through one of these platforms. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3915.8399999999997s)]
*  Before they existed, all you ever had were the articles [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3919.72s)]
*  that might pop up on this website by this writer [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3923.08s)]
*  or that writer or whatever they got on the news, [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3926.16s)]
*  and obviously, they don't ever always tell you [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3929.3199999999997s)]
*  the full story on anything, [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3932.48s)]
*  but when you got people that now can go on [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3934.52s)]
*  to any social media platform [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3937.8799999999997s)]
*  and tell you exactly what they saw [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3940.3199999999997s)]
*  without worrying about what the FCC's gonna say [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3943.12s)]
*  about the reporting or what your senior editor staff [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3946.3599999999997s)]
*  and staff is gonna say about how you brought this story, [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3950.56s)]
*  you don't gotta worry about any of that. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3953.88s)]
*  Boom, you could capture that, talk about it, [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3955.8399999999997s)]
*  and it go viral, and now you're a voice [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3959.64s)]
*  because people are listening to you now. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3962.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3964.72s)]
*  And that's- [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3966.3599999999997s)]
*  Different world. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3967.2s)]
*  Yeah, that's different. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3968.08s)]
*  And you have a bunch of voices now. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3969.2s)]
*  People will be heard now. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3971.3599999999997s)]
*  But the problem with that too, though, [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3974.0s)]
*  is now that you also have the troll generation [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3975.88s)]
*  that they're there to troll anything, [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3979.68s)]
*  even if it's really good information, [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3983.16s)]
*  they're there to just bring it all down [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3986.24s)]
*  because that's what they do. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3990.12s)]
*  It doesn't matter if it's something [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3992.2799999999997s)]
*  that's gonna help someone, [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3994.48s)]
*  there's always those folks that wanna come tear it down. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3995.72s)]
*  There's always people that wanna throw rocks at windows. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=3999.72s)]
*  Right. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4002.0s)]
*  That's true, but I kinda think the one thing that they do [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4003.76s)]
*  is they strengthen up the defense [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4007.56s)]
*  of whatever you're trying to promote. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4009.32s)]
*  Like, it has to become more undeniable [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4011.1200000000003s)]
*  if trolls can crack your defenses. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4014.08s)]
*  You gotta use them as fuel, basically. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4016.44s)]
*  David Goggins says he takes all of his haters, [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4020.56s)]
*  like all the shit that they said to him, [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4023.88s)]
*  and he puts it on like a soundtrack, [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4025.56s)]
*  and he listens to it when he runs. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4028.32s)]
*  He says it out, he reads it out. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4030.6400000000003s)]
*  You know how psycho he is? [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4033.16s)]
*  That's his Rocky anthem? [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4034.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4035.24s)]
*  Dude, he puts shit that people say about him, [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4036.08s)]
*  he puts it on an audio track and runs on it. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4039.28s)]
*  You know, I would imagine that's likened to a boxer [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4042.4s)]
*  putting up the picture of the other boxer [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4046.24s)]
*  that's been talking shit the whole time, [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4048.72s)]
*  or MMA fighter, you know what I mean? [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4051.16s)]
*  Like, boom, here's this fucker on the wall. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4053.04s)]
*  And in the movie on the day of the fight, [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4055.16s)]
*  he rips the poster down, you motherfucker. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4056.32s)]
*  You motherfucker, you're bad. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4059.12s)]
*  Fuck you, I got you, bitch. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4060.32s)]
*  That is an interesting way to fuel up, [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4063.08s)]
*  like to record all your hater statements. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4067.28s)]
*  It's just playing back to yourself. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4070.64s)]
*  If you listen to David's life story, [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4072.4s)]
*  David has two incredible books. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4074.08s)]
*  They're amazing, and one of the things about the books [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4077.16s)]
*  that's so amazing is you realize like what he endured [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4080.48s)]
*  as a child and what he went through, [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4083.64s)]
*  like the abuse that he received, [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4085.72s)]
*  and how he came out of that, this unstoppable dude. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4088.48s)]
*  And he was like fat at one point in time. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4093.6s)]
*  He was open about all of it. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4095.4s)]
*  He was like 300 pounds just drinking milkshakes, [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4096.4s)]
*  and he couldn't even run around the block. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4098.92s)]
*  And then he turned himself into that dude. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4100.68s)]
*  He unlocked it. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4102.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4103.76s)]
*  You know, that goes to show you the strength [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4104.6s)]
*  that the human spirit has. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4106.56s)]
*  You can be shit on your whole life, [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4109.12s)]
*  deprived of these opportunities here or there, [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4112.28s)]
*  maybe not have the guidance from your parents or whatever, [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4116.4400000000005s)]
*  or maybe not even have any, [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4120.280000000001s)]
*  because some kids get abandoned and stuff like that. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4121.68s)]
*  And to be able to pull out of that [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4125.56s)]
*  and that not be the anchor that holds you down [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4128.400000000001s)]
*  for the rest of your life, and that's your excuse. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4131.320000000001s)]
*  Like, oh, well, the reason I wasn't able to do this [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4133.92s)]
*  was because of, you can always get past these things. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4138.0s)]
*  You just gotta look inside and then eventually [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4141.76s)]
*  let all that shit go and use it as fuel and strength. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4144.48s)]
*  And it's great to hear when people actually do this, [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4147.719999999999s)]
*  because it is possible. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4150.879999999999s)]
*  We do have this ability in us. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4152.32s)]
*  We just gotta look deep inside, even when it's ugly, [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4155.2s)]
*  because that's the thing, right? [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4158.5199999999995s)]
*  Everybody wants it all nice. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4160.28s)]

*  And you don't want all the ugliness, [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4162.959999999999s)]
*  but sometimes life is ugly and we deal with it as people, [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4166.16s)]
*  depending how you grew up, your upbringing, [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4170.0s)]
*  or you grew up in poverty or whatever. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4172.48s)]
*  These are things that you deal with, [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4177.2s)]
*  but it doesn't define you. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4178.719999999999s)]
*  You could look within and unlock that shit [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4181.36s)]
*  that unlocks your full potential [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4183.959999999999s)]
*  to take you out of that situation [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4186.799999999999s)]
*  and put you in a better place [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4189.04s)]
*  and allow you to evolve and grow and to be a better person. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4191.879999999999s)]
*  And not perpetuate any of the shit you went through [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4197.679999999999s)]
*  to now your kids or whoever else. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4202.04s)]
*  That is possible. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4204.88s)]
*  People just gotta know that that's possible. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4206.0s)]
*  It is possible. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4208.64s)]
*  And then there's people that take it to different levels. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4210.16s)]
*  Some people just improve their life, [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4213.24s)]
*  and then there's guys like Goggins, [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4214.8s)]
*  who's just always trying to push the boundaries [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4216.4s)]
*  of what's physically possible for a human body to endure, [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4219.68s)]
*  which is just a nutty way to live your life. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4223.44s)]
*  Just to fucking run hundreds and hundreds of miles. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4225.6s)]
*  His knees were fucked up, [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4229.12s)]
*  so fucked up that the doctor looked at it and said, [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4231.36s)]
*  I can't even believe you can walk on these knees. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4233.64s)]
*  Forget about run thousands of miles. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4236.12s)]
*  He was just bone on bone on his knees [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4239.12s)]
*  and just enduring pain. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4241.08s)]
*  It's crazy, till the wheels fall off. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4242.36s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4244.0s)]
*  Till the wheels fall off. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4244.84s)]
*  That's the human spirit. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4245.66s)]
*  I mean, there's one of these dudes who's, [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4246.72s)]
*  he goes up Everest and he conquered the, [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4252.88s)]
*  what is it, how many summits are there that? [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4256.88s)]
*  Oh, you mean Nims Die? [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4260.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4261.56s)]
*  Yeah, how do you say his name? [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4262.400000000001s)]
*  He was a guest on the podcast. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4263.72s)]
*  I mean, I don't wanna fuck up the pronunciation. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4265.84s)]
*  I mean, that's crazy. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4268.76s)]
*  That's an amazing documentary. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4269.72s)]
*  Was it 12 Peaks? [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4271.28s)]
*  Yeah, 12 Peaks, there you go. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4272.2s)]
*  I mean, when you think what it takes to do that once. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4274.2s)]
*  Nims Purja, and it's like, [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4279.08s)]
*  is Nims Jai his Instagram handle? [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4281.66s)]
*  Is that what it is? [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4285.78s)]
*  But fascinating dude. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4287.84s)]
*  And he was like a special operator [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4289.52s)]
*  and had incredible endurance. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4296.24s)]
*  Yeah, but his endurance, [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4300.24s)]
*  what he's capable of doing is fucking extraordinary. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4302.32s)]
*  He goes up there with no air, man. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4305.84s)]
*  He doesn't have assisted air [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4307.72s)]
*  and apparently his VO2 max is through the roof. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4310.04s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4313.92s)]
*  When you think about what it takes to do one. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4314.74s)]
*  One, and he's done 12. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4317.58s)]
*  And he was banging them off quick. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4319.74s)]
*  You know what's crazy? [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4322.46s)]
*  Speaking of that, did you catch the one [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4324.26s)]
*  about when the earthquake hit? [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4328.139999999999s)]
*  They were at Everest and it hit two different places, [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4330.78s)]
*  I think in the city. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4337.219999999999s)]
*  Well, it affected three different places. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4339.74s)]
*  It affected the city, the small village, [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4341.78s)]
*  I can't remember what it was called, [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4344.18s)]
*  and the people that were climbing up Everest. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4345.66s)]
*  There was two camps and the people that were in camp one, [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4349.06s)]
*  they got stuck up there for some time [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4354.22s)]
*  because when the earthquake hit, [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4357.26s)]
*  they had no idea on that day what was happening for them. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4359.240000000001s)]
*  But the people that were at base camp, [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4365.02s)]
*  what happened there, a lot of them got wiped out. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4367.9400000000005s)]
*  It was crazy. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4370.34s)]
*  Was it an avalanche? [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4371.18s)]
*  Yeah, it was an avalanche that came. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4372.18s)]
*  It's a documentary that tells you [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4375.02s)]
*  what happened in that earthquake. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4377.9800000000005s)]
*  There you go, aftershock. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4379.42s)]
*  Man, it devastated three places [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4381.860000000001s)]
*  like you wouldn't believe, man. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4384.820000000001s)]
*  I mean, because a lot of that is like old structure, yeah. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4386.66s)]
*  Look at the devastation from avalanche. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4390.46s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4392.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, from base camp over there. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4394.54s)]
*  And this is in the city of Nepal, I believe. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4397.360000000001s)]
*  Talk about living in a totally different way. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4400.820000000001s)]
*  Living up there at the base of those mountains. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4404.58s)]
*  What? [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4409.42s)]
*  What the fuck, man? [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4410.86s)]
*  I can't imagine being up there during an earthquake [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4412.46s)]
*  knowing that the avalanche is coming down. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4414.7s)]
*  That's gotta be one of the most fucked up ways to go, [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4416.82s)]
*  an avalanche. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4419.42s)]
*  Just seeing this mountain of snow coming your way. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4421.0599999999995s)]
*  Imagine how many bodies are buried in that mountain. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4423.66s)]
*  That mountain's alive. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4426.74s)]
*  Well, that's how those like Iceman dudes, right? [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4427.94s)]
*  When they found that dude in the glacier, [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4430.62s)]
*  completely frozen is probably how he got taken out. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4432.3s)]
*  Something similar or fell in a crack somewhere, [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4435.46s)]
*  got wiped out. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4438.74s)]
*  Was I just gonna ask you, [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4441.860000000001s)]
*  what were we just talking about before that? [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4443.54s)]
*  It was pronunciation on dudes' names. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4447.38s)]
*  No, I lost it. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4450.22s)]
*  Nobody passed it. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4451.06s)]
*  God damn it, that's marijuana. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4451.900000000001s)]
*  That stoner thing. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4453.34s)]
*  It is. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4454.38s)]
*  The guy that was looking up before that [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4455.22s)]
*  was the immigration laws? [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4456.04s)]
*  Oh yeah, that was where it was. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4457.7s)]
*  Oh, okay, so I have a... [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4459.26s)]
*  1920 was the change of when all this started going down. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4461.5s)]
*  Okay. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4465.62s)]
*  After World War I, [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4466.54s)]
*  America became an isolationist nation in December 1920. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4467.66s)]
*  In the context of isolationism, [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4471.66s)]
*  the international influenza pandemic, [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4473.5s)]
*  and a post-war economic recession, [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4475.5s)]
*  the US House of Representatives voted to end all immigration [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4477.780000000001s)]
*  to the United States for one year. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4480.9400000000005s)]
*  So that was just one year though. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4483.06s)]
*  So then they added... [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4484.66s)]
*  It got interesting right down here. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4486.58s)]
*  The Quota Act, 1921. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4487.42s)]
*  It was a place called Midnight Races, [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4489.38s)]
*  where boats had to get into the shore by midnight, [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4491.5s)]
*  or they were gonna get fined for bringing people [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4493.9s)]
*  that exceeded the quota. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4495.94s)]
*  Wow. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4498.179999999999s)]
*  So they have to get in there quick? [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4499.0199999999995s)]
*  So they're racing to get to shore? [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4501.0599999999995s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4502.9s)]
*  100%. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4503.74s)]
*  And then if they came an hour later though, [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4504.58s)]
*  they'd be allowed in on the next day's quota. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4506.62s)]
*  Which sounds like it gets confusing. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4509.099999999999s)]

*  oh, what's he doing? [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4536.58s)]

*  He's fucking killing it, I gotta tell you. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4541.66s)]

*  Man. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4555.02s)]
*  He had a run though. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4556.02s)]

*  He got close. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4559.3s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4568.46s)]
*  Like of all this shit, because how crazy [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4569.3s)]
*  is a presidential pardon? [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4571.3s)]
*  How crazy is it that there's a thing [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4573.18s)]
*  that if you become president, you can decide [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4575.5s)]
*  that you're gonna take a person who's in jail [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4578.9400000000005s)]

*  Well, don't you feel bad? [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4587.62s)]
*  Good. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4589.06s)]
*  You're free. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4589.900000000001s)]
*  You could do that if you're president. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4590.860000000001s)]
*  How many pardons do they get to issue out? [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4592.26s)]
*  That's a good question. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4596.5s)]
*  I don't know if there's a quota. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4597.740000000001s)]
*  I don't know if there's a cap on it. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4599.26s)]
*  Because they all do at least one. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4601.26s)]
*  Oh, they do a lot. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4603.02s)]
*  Yeah, but what is the quota? [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4604.74s)]
*  How many do they get to pardon? [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4607.02s)]
*  I think they do like, what's the most anyone's ever done? [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4609.58s)]
*  I'd like to know that. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4613.42s)]
*  If there is a cap, I'd like to know [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4614.8s)]
*  if everybody hits the cap. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4616.06s)]
*  Among the president's power is broad. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4617.66s)]
*  It is not without accepted limitations. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4619.9400000000005s)]
*  Perhaps the most important, that the president [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4622.88s)]
*  can only pardon federal offenses. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4624.58s)]
*  He cannot interfere with state prosecutions. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4626.9400000000005s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4629.46s)]
*  Anything federal. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4630.3s)]
*  So he's unlimited in terms of if there's a federal issue, [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4631.22s)]
*  he could issue a pardon. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4635.5s)]
*  Is there a limit to presidential pardons? [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4637.74s)]
*  What is the only exception to the president's pardon power? [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4640.62s)]
*  Under the Constitution, the president's clemency power [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4644.34s)]
*  extends to all federal criminal offenses [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4646.62s)]
*  except in cases of impeachment. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4649.54s)]
*  So an impeachment, okay, but so. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4651.9400000000005s)]
*  So if the president's homie did a state crime, [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4654.38s)]
*  he can't do shit for him, but if it's a federal crime, [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4659.06s)]
*  he can totally say, I'm gonna give you this [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4661.860000000001s)]
*  get out of jail free card. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4665.06s)]
*  That's wild. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4666.38s)]
*  That's wild. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4667.22s)]
*  It's wild that one man can have that much power. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4668.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4670.820000000001s)]
*  That's so crazy. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4671.660000000001s)]
*  And you know, what's different than state and federal [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4672.740000000001s)]
*  is that state, you can get released early [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4676.620000000001s)]
*  based off of what you do in that time. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4678.820000000001s)]
*  If you're an ideal inmate working and educating yourself, [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4681.280000000001s)]
*  and you know, good behavior, right, as they call it, [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4686.28s)]
*  you might be able to cut some of your time off [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4692.36s)]
*  in state time, but federal time, [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4694.599999999999s)]
*  you do pretty much 95% of it. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4697.0s)]
*  There is no splicing that time down. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4699.099999999999s)]
*  So realistically, hey, you want that card. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4702.679999999999s)]
*  If you're creating federal crimes out there, [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4705.96s)]
*  you want the president to have that card for you. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4711.24s)]
*  Can you imagine the amount of text message [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4713.639999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump got before he left office? [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4716.0s)]
*  To those particular guys? [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4718.54s)]
*  Pardon my cousin, pardon my friend's boss, [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4719.379999999999s)]
*  pardon this guy. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4722.879999999999s)]
*  How many people, ooh, look at this. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4724.32s)]
*  Barack Obama pardoned 1,927 people. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4726.28s)]
*  He seems like he's got the most. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4731.0s)]
*  He's got the most, yeah. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4732.639999999999s)]
*  Trump only had 237. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4733.5599999999995s)]
*  So that was close. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4736.12s)]
*  That was real close. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4737.2s)]
*  237 loyal people. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4738.44s)]
*  They were so loyal, these people. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4740.660000000001s)]
*  So it seems like Obama had the most. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4743.740000000001s)]
*  But you know what, man, how many people are in jail [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4746.320000000001s)]
*  for the wrong reasons? [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4748.780000000001s)]
*  How many people are in jail for bullshit? [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4749.780000000001s)]
*  How many people are in jail under false crimes, [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4752.3s)]
*  crimes they didn't commit? [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4756.5s)]
*  A lot, turns out a lot. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4758.22s)]
*  A lot, they're still figuring out [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4759.9400000000005s)]
*  how they let some of these people out [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4762.1s)]
*  that they were supposed to let out for cannabis [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4764.400000000001s)]
*  in some of the states where it's legal. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4767.78s)]
*  That's why the last prisoner project exists [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4770.46s)]
*  so that they can go and help those folks in those states [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4775.259999999999s)]
*  provided that it wasn't, I believe that it wasn't, [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4779.139999999999s)]
*  if it wasn't, let's say a violent crime attached to it, [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4782.74s)]
*  obviously they're trying to get a lot of these people out [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4789.099999999999s)]
*  because I think if you got obviously a violent crime [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4792.2s)]
*  attached to your cannabis charge, [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4796.22s)]
*  they're not just letting you out. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4798.780000000001s)]
*  You gotta deal with whatever that is. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4800.46s)]
*  But anything that was just cannabis-related possession [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4802.46s)]
*  that didn't have any of that, [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4807.46s)]
*  they're trying to get a lot of these people released [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4810.02s)]
*  and they still haven't done that. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4812.26s)]
*  Could you imagine going to jail and then, [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4814.02s)]
*  there was a story about a guy who got arrested in Phoenix. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4817.3s)]
*  We talked about this before. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4821.900000000001s)]
*  He was a young kid and I wanna say he's 20, 21 years old [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4823.34s)]
*  and he sold weed to this undercover cop a couple times. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4829.74s)]
*  And then they got him for selling more than an ounce [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4836.16s)]
*  and because he had a prior with something else, [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4839.46s)]
*  like an assault, but that he did his time. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4842.22s)]
*  A South Phoenix kid got 16 years in a slammer [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4846.42s)]
*  for one ounce of weed. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4848.900000000001s)]
*  So 16 years, they're punishing him for this [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4850.26s)]
*  and now weed's legal in Phoenix. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4853.34s)]
*  So this dude is now in a jail for selling something [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4856.54s)]
*  to an undercover cop who kinda like, come on man. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4860.66s)]
*  The undercover cop thing is so fucking. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4864.26s)]
*  If we knew the cops were just 100% honest all the time, [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4867.66s)]
*  maybe, but you're allowing cops to professionally lie [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4872.02s)]
*  and go undercover to try to buy weed from a kid. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4875.34s)]
*  What are you wasting my tax dollars on, motherfucker? [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4878.54s)]
*  They got nothing better to do. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4880.9400000000005s)]
*  Isn't there someone stealing cars [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4882.3s)]
*  or breaking into houses out there that you can go handle? [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4884.26s)]
*  Why the fuck are you bothering this dude [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4886.5s)]
*  selling little bags of weed for a little extra money? [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4888.86s)]
*  And to be able to put that guy in a cage for 16 years [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4892.7s)]
*  while there's legal stores there now in the same place? [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4896.5s)]
*  Yeah. Insanity. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4899.66s)]
*  Yeah, I mean. It's insanity. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4901.42s)]
*  Yeah, and he's one of those cases that they should look at [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4903.82s)]
*  with the last prisoner project. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4908.1s)]
*  They should look at a case like that and be like, okay, [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4909.700000000001s)]
*  we're gonna rally behind a guy like this. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4912.740000000001s)]
*  Cause I mean. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4914.46s)]
*  The problem is he's not even wrongly accused. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4916.46s)]
*  The problem is the law as applied, [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4918.54s)]
*  that's fucking horrendous to do that to a 21 year old kid [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4920.700000000001s)]
*  to give him 16 years for selling an ounce and a half [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4925.1s)]
*  of weed or whatever it was. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4928.26s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4930.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy man. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4932.3s)]
*  That's why people gotta make the change. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4934.18s)]
*  They can't depend on politicians for this. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4937.38s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4939.86s)]
*  Like get the group of people that will go out there [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4940.7s)]
*  and do the work and put this on the state legislation [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4944.86s)]
*  and legalize it or decriminalize it in your state [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4949.1s)]
*  so that shit like that does not happen. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4952.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4954.22s)]
*  And it's legal in Arizona. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4955.06s)]
*  It's legal now where this guy's in jail. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4958.26s)]
*  So it's so insane. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4960.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4961.86s)]
*  It's so insane. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4962.7s)]
*  And you know, I mean you can go on and on about it [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4964.0199999999995s)]
*  but like how many people have their lives ruined [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4967.9s)]
*  for no fucking reason? [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4971.46s)]
*  No logical reason. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4972.9s)]
*  Doesn't make any sense at all. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4974.14s)]
*  Well you know, when you think about [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4975.62s)]
*  that half of the politicians out there and legislators [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4977.7s)]
*  and you know some even in the entertainment industry [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4982.98s)]
*  you know they're invested in private prisons. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4988.94s)]
*  They wanna keep them prisons full. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4991.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4993.82s)]
*  There's a little bit of that. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4994.66s)]
*  So there's that part too. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4995.82s)]
*  So you know a lot of things, a lot of laws [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=4998.38s)]
*  to a lot of folks in different places are unfair [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5001.26s)]
*  especially as it relates to cannabis. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5004.58s)]
*  Well what's really wild is there's this massive history [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5006.98s)]
*  of human usage, right? [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5010.5s)]
*  It goes back thousands and thousands of years. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5012.099999999999s)]
*  And then in the 1930s they decide to do [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5014.62s)]
*  this propaganda campaign against weed [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5019.62s)]
*  and they do Reefer Madness. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5022.22s)]
*  Reefer Madness, yeah. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5023.82s)]
*  And all these fucking movies that show people smoking pot [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5024.66s)]
*  and going crazy and losing their fucking minds [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5027.82s)]
*  and just lets you know this is gonna take hold [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5029.94s)]
*  of your children. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5032.3s)]
*  So they turned this thing that everybody had always used [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5033.54s)]
*  into this new drug. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5036.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5038.22s)]
*  And they called it marijuana and you know as well as I know [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5039.0599999999995s)]
*  that's not the, that's the name for a wild Mexican tobacco. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5041.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5044.26s)]
*  They came up with a name and attached it to cannabis [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5045.099999999999s)]
*  which people had always used. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5047.66s)]
*  And they turned it into this scary thing. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5049.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5051.3s)]
*  And then they told farmers like you could still grow it [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5052.14s)]
*  for hemp but all this weed smoking shit, [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5053.900000000001s)]
*  this is over kids. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5056.62s)]
*  We're gonna, you know we're gonna make this illegal. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5057.820000000001s)]
*  You're gonna need a tax stamp for that hemp [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5059.5s)]
*  and these fucking, they figured out a way to get people [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5061.74s)]
*  to believe that this thing that people had taken forever [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5066.18s)]
*  was fucking dangerous and ruining lives. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5068.54s)]
*  And that propaganda from the 1930s, from those movies [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5070.66s)]
*  still works today. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5074.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5075.860000000001s)]
*  And the momentum of it, it raised our grandparents, [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5076.7s)]
*  our grandparents raised our parents. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5079.74s)]
*  It's in us. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5081.9s)]
*  It's like the dumbest shit. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5083.179999999999s)]
*  It's true. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5085.74s)]
*  Fortunately it stopped at our parents. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5087.22s)]
*  Like a lot of people got open after that [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5090.139999999999s)]
*  and actually turned their parents on because like [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5092.58s)]
*  when you go into dispensaries now, you see cats our age [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5095.3s)]
*  right and obviously younger people but you see seniors [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5099.46s)]
*  up in there as well. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5103.98s)]
*  Whether they're in there for edibles [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5105.780000000001s)]
*  or they're gonna smoke flour or even concentrates [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5107.740000000001s)]
*  which trips me out but. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5110.9400000000005s)]
*  The old folks like get down with that but you see it. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5114.5s)]
*  And fortunately that's because there's a lot of information [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5119.740000000001s)]
*  out there now that you know like if you're not sure [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5123.58s)]
*  about that propaganda that you grew up to, [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5126.66s)]
*  you can always now do your own diligence [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5129.3s)]
*  and do your own homework and find other articles [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5131.98s)]
*  based on cannabis that will tell you positive things. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5135.299999999999s)]
*  And this is things they've never realized or thought of [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5138.82s)]
*  or heard before and it opens up their world. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5141.78s)]
*  Now it's not enough of them because I think if it was, [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5145.0599999999995s)]
*  if it was common knowledge amongst everybody [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5150.74s)]
*  that this is a healing plant and aside from casual use, [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5153.379999999999s)]
*  it can benefit people, more people would embrace it. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5157.179999999999s)]
*  And you see that happening but it's just slow [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5161.5s)]
*  for some reason still. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5165.54s)]
*  Everything's slow man because we were talking about before, [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5166.94s)]
*  I think people have preconceived notions [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5169.94s)]
*  that they don't wanna dismiss, they don't wanna let go of. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5172.22s)]
*  Even when they're confronted with new evidence, [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5174.62s)]
*  they wanna like still stay, no weed is for losers. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5176.78s)]
*  Weeds for goddamn losers. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5179.7s)]
*  Or gateway. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5181.14s)]
*  Yeah, it's a goddamn gateway drug. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5181.98s)]
*  Listen Mr. B. Real, you might be able to do it [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5184.34s)]
*  and do it but what if my son starts doing ketamine [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5186.14s)]
*  afterwards and fighting with the cops? [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5188.86s)]
*  Kicking out back windows. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5191.66s)]
*  Kicking out back windows barefoot. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5192.94s)]
*  Like Kenny Loggins. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5194.34s)]

*  Yeah, man. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5319.0599999999995s)]
*  So it's nearly double the amount of fentanyl overdoses [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5319.9s)]
*  in 2019 in 2020. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5322.62s)]

*  It doubled the amount of deaths? [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5340.7s)]
*  Is that what it said? [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5342.58s)]
*  No, up 25%. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5343.419999999999s)]
*  Up 25. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5344.94s)]
*  But from, what was the one that it said afterwards? [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5345.78s)]
*  Is it double the time before that? [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5348.0599999999995s)]
*  What was the last quote? [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5350.219999999999s)]
*  I don't see a double anywhere, I don't know. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5353.339999999999s)]
*  Can you put it back up? [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5355.179999999999s)]
*  Yes, it's nearly up there. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5356.0199999999995s)]
*  And it's nearly doubled the amount of fentanyl overdoses. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5358.139999999999s)]

*  Okay, so that's what I'm saying. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5360.9s)]
*  So that figure is up from 25% of 2020 [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5362.139999999999s)]

*  I see Doug reclining his front seat of his car, [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5495.86s)]
*  just low, chilling there. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5499.54s)]
*  He had to actually take a pause before he left. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5501.46s)]
*  Of course. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5504.14s)]
*  Yeah, you better. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5505.42s)]
*  You don't wanna be shaky [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5506.78s)]
*  while you're out there driving your Tesla. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5508.26s)]
*  Oh man. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5509.86s)]
*  Yeah, he was definitely affected. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5511.42s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5513.62s)]
*  Stay put, stay put. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5515.46s)]
*  Let that wear off. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5516.74s)]
*  Take a walk around the block. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5518.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5520.139999999999s)]
*  Don't get in a fucking car. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5520.98s)]
*  Take a little walk. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5521.82s)]
*  Don't get in the car. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5522.66s)]
*  Don't try to drive. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5523.5s)]
*  Because I smoked out with Doug before, [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5525.7s)]
*  and he took a hit of our eight-footer. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5528.259999999999s)]
*  We were doing a show with Sublime with Rome somewhere. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5531.299999999999s)]
*  Can't remember, but this was a tour we did with them. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5536.82s)]
*  One show, it was towards the end of the tour, [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5540.22s)]
*  we broke out the bong, and Rome wanted to hit it. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5544.18s)]
*  And I think, yeah, that's it right there. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5548.38s)]
*  It was made by Roar. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5550.3s)]
*  Whoa, look at that thing. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5551.900000000001s)]
*  And Rome wanted to hit it, [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5553.02s)]
*  because he had seen me hit it with Doug. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5554.26s)]
*  We took a hit of that bong, and Rome had to like, [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5558.42s)]
*  he had to leave the party for a while and collect himself. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5562.62s)]
*  That looks ridiculous. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5566.22s)]
*  That's just too much. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5567.82s)]
*  That bong right there is too much. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5568.78s)]
*  That's too much. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5570.54s)]
*  I'll be honest with you, when Bobo started hitting it, [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5571.38s)]
*  I stopped hitting it. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5574.179999999999s)]
*  I was like, I used that as a, [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5575.179999999999s)]
*  no, Bobo wants to hit it, let him do it. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5576.38s)]
*  Look at the size of that thing. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5578.66s)]
*  Well, yeah, it's a thick tube all the way down. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5580.46s)]
*  Is that glass? [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5586.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5587.5s)]
*  So that's a delicate piece of instrument right there. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5588.34s)]
*  Yeah, it's almost been crushed a couple times. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5591.34s)]
*  That one's like a six foot four. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5596.42s)]
*  A six foot four piece of glass. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5599.82s)]
*  That's really delicate, isn't it? [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5601.42s)]
*  That one right there, you could break down. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5603.34s)]
*  You see in the- [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5605.0599999999995s)]
*  Oh, there's segments to it? [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5605.9s)]
*  Yeah, there's segments to it. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5606.98s)]
*  Roar made it so we could break it down. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5608.0599999999995s)]
*  But this one over here to- [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5609.62s)]
*  What do you put it in like a fucking- [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5610.94s)]
*  Yeah, we had a road case for it. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5612.46s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5613.94s)]
*  So we would just shuffle it off. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5614.78s)]
*  But the other one, where I'm lighting it for Eric Bobo, [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5616.78s)]
*  I think it's further down, just a little bit further down. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5622.3s)]
*  Where was it? [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5624.78s)]
*  Where he's standing on a box. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5626.34s)]
*  It's an eight foot piece. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5628.66s)]
*  That's one long ass piece. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5629.98s)]
*  There's no, you know, we didn't have a case for that one. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5631.62s)]
*  That one, and we still have both of them. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5634.099999999999s)]
*  Neither of them is broken, fortunately. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5636.3s)]
*  Fantastic job. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5638.86s)]
*  When they ask for our Hall of Fame piece, [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5640.179999999999s)]
*  we'll be like, here, put this in there. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5642.86s)]
*  It made it. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5645.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah, hey man, those two bongs toured [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5646.099999999999s)]
*  as long as any one person toured with us then. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5649.099999999999s)]
*  And they lived. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5652.62s)]
*  That's incredible. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5653.94s)]
*  That shows the deep respect you guys have for the bongs. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5654.94s)]
*  This one here. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5657.259999999999s)]
*  That one's ridiculous. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5658.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's an eight footer made by Zong. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5658.94s)]
*  How many pieces is that? [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5660.54s)]
*  That's just one piece. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5661.74s)]
*  That's insane. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5662.74s)]
*  How do you carry that around? [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5663.58s)]
*  Very carefully. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5665.7s)]
*  Each town? [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5666.9s)]
*  You have one in storage in each town? [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5668.0199999999995s)]
*  We used to have to put it in the bunk area of the bus [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5670.139999999999s)]
*  and like tape it to the edges of the floor so that nobody- [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5674.099999999999s)]
*  And that's all glass? [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5677.62s)]
*  That's all glass, yeah. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5678.62s)]
*  Wow. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5679.98s)]
*  We took that thing around with us for like 10 years [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5681.42s)]
*  and it never broke, fortunately. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5684.02s)]
*  It sits in my studio now. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5686.26s)]
*  How many kids have used plastic bongs [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5688.26s)]
*  and inhaled some fucking weird shit through the plastic? [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5691.7s)]
*  Oh man. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5695.26s)]
*  I mean, I think we all started that way. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5696.86s)]
*  I mean, like the first bongs that we were hitting [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5698.66s)]
*  that I remember were the acrylic graphic bongs. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5701.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5705.66s)]
*  Graphics. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5706.5s)]
*  You know, another thing I remember [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5707.46s)]
*  is we used to smoke out of pipes [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5708.5s)]
*  and I was like, why does this always taste like lighter fluid? [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5710.42s)]
*  And I realized I'm inhaling lighter fluid, [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5713.7s)]
*  you fucking idiot, cause you always look- [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5715.78s)]
*  And then those were fucking like metal pieces. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5717.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5721.78s)]
*  No one, none of us had really, we didn't know. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5722.62s)]
*  No. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5725.42s)]
*  We just didn't know. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5726.26s)]
*  We didn't know. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5727.08s)]
*  Now we know. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5727.92s)]
*  Now we know. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5728.76s)]
*  Yeah, look at this plastic bong. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5729.58s)]
*  For sure you're getting some fucking, [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5730.9400000000005s)]
*  all that stuff that Shana Swan talks about, [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5732.9800000000005s)]
*  all the phthalates and everything. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5735.58s)]
*  It's a metal bowl. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5737.22s)]
*  Filtered through water. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5738.54s)]
*  Acrylic plastic bong, whatever. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5739.74s)]
*  Don't you think that some heat gets to the base [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5742.22s)]
*  of that plastic being the close proximity to the fire? [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5744.78s)]
*  And don't you think that would affect [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5748.46s)]
*  with the way the plastic leaches into the water? [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5749.82s)]
*  I'm here for a natural, healthy bong experience. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5753.14s)]
*  I mean, it could. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5755.98s)]
*  I don't know that that's the best thing [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5756.82s)]
*  you should be worrying about in that scenario. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5757.66s)]
*  It could, but I think what they used for the downstem was, [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5759.1s)]
*  it's hard to say. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5766.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5766.9s)]
*  It's hard to say. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5767.74s)]
*  They used a glass downstem. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5768.56s)]
*  So it sort of had a little bit of separation, [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5770.8s)]
*  but yeah, I mean, it got way better [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5773.46s)]
*  when the bong started being made of glass. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5776.84s)]
*  It was just a better experience. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5780.72s)]
*  You're not supposed to be sucking on plastic all day. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5782.56s)]
*  Nah. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5784.4800000000005s)]
*  It seems very dorm room too. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5786.84s)]
*  Oh man, once Jerome Baker came out [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5788.64s)]
*  with his crazy ass pieces, man, [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5790.9400000000005s)]
*  it just blew the whole glass piece world up. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5792.96s)]
*  We fucked up many a podcast early in the day [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5797.44s)]
*  because we used the volcano. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5800.879999999999s)]
*  We would do these podcasts on the volcano [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5805.16s)]
*  right next to us. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5807.16s)]
*  We would fill that bag up. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5808.259999999999s)]
*  If you don't know what a volcano is, folks, [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5810.0199999999995s)]
*  it's a vaporizer. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5811.48s)]
*  And you put the weed in over this heating element [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5814.12s)]
*  and it blows smoke. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5817.28s)]
*  It blows the smoke. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5819.08s)]
*  It's like a mist actually, not the smoke. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5820.639999999999s)]
*  It heats it to a specific temperature [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5822.48s)]
*  that melts the THC crystals but doesn't burn the flower. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5824.92s)]
*  And so then it all goes into this bag, this mist. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5828.2s)]
*  It's a giant ass bag. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5831.24s)]
*  And you. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5832.72s)]
*  Yeah, those are the best, man. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5834.32s)]
*  And you go deep. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5835.4800000000005s)]
*  But sometimes you go too deep. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5838.24s)]
*  You don't know what the fuck you're talking about [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5839.64s)]
*  while you're talking. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5840.92s)]
*  While you're talking, you're trying to figure out [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5842.08s)]
*  what you're saying because you're too high. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5843.5s)]
*  It's a good blast and the flavor's good. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5845.12s)]
*  Have you tried? [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5847.56s)]
*  It's very relaxing. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5848.4s)]
*  It's not harsh at all. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5849.96s)]
*  Have you tried using the Stunden glass? [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5851.6s)]
*  Have you ever seen that? [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5853.64s)]
*  It's a gravity piece you could use for flower or concentrate. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5854.919999999999s)]
*  We use it for concentrate. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5859.919999999999s)]
*  Seth Rogen was the first guy that anybody's seen with it. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5863.16s)]
*  They sent him a piece and it's this one. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5866.759999999999s)]
*  He was the first one with it [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5869.919999999999s)]
*  but we did a collaboration with these guys. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5871.04s)]
*  But you flip, each flip pushes out a hit. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5872.639999999999s)]
*  And you could do hookah with it [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5876.5599999999995s)]
*  or you can do flower with it. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5877.959999999999s)]
*  But again, we use it for concentrate. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5880.299999999999s)]
*  It's because the taste that comes out of it is crazy. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5885.44s)]
*  But what we'll do on our show is the first 30 minutes, [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5887.14s)]
*  we try to have a no curse rule. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5891.06s)]
*  And it's just for sport. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5894.78s)]
*  So whoever curses got to either do a shot [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5896.52s)]
*  or five flips from the Stunden. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5898.78s)]
*  Five? [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5900.46s)]
*  Oh man, one day I ramped up and had to do 30 hits [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5901.38s)]
*  because I was just out of pocket that first 15 minutes. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5906.5s)]
*  I was like, fuck this, shit that. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5911.22s)]
*  Bro, out of pocket is one of the greatest statements ever. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5913.14s)]
*  I love that statement. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5915.58s)]
*  I love when people say out of pocket. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5916.58s)]
*  I've never confidently said out of pocket. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5918.72s)]
*  We could do that for the next Protect Our Parks. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5921.06s)]
*  I have one, I'll bring it. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5923.42s)]
*  Dude, that's what we're doing. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5924.740000000001s)]
*  Whoever gets fucked up has to take a penalty hit. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5926.42s)]
*  You know who's not gonna do it is Shane. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5929.26s)]
*  Shane gets scared of the weed. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5930.780000000001s)]
*  It's too bad. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5931.820000000001s)]
*  He's a Bud Light man. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5932.660000000001s)]
*  He likes to get barbecued on the Bud Light. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5933.4800000000005s)]
*  So you guys drink Bud Lights and if he, [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5934.320000000001s)]
*  any penalty he has, he's gonna hit the weed. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5935.780000000001s)]
*  He's gonna have to go. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5937.02s)]
*  And A, it works. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5938.860000000001s)]
*  I tell you, that day I was so blown out [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5940.02s)]
*  by the end of the show. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5942.42s)]
*  When I got home, I was like, it hit me later. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5943.38s)]
*  It didn't hit me while we're sitting there doing the show. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5945.9s)]
*  It got me when I got home. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5950.02s)]
*  I was sitting there and I'll go to sleep [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5951.54s)]
*  till like 11, 30, 12 o'clock, something like that. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5953.9800000000005s)]
*  And by 10 o'clock, I was like, I was like, [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5956.46s)]
*  I'm struggling. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5959.26s)]
*  And I knew it was from the 30 hits. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5960.9400000000005s)]
*  Oh, fuck. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5963.38s)]
*  30 hits is so crazy. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5964.22s)]
*  That's so deep. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5967.02s)]
*  Yeah, we punish each other like this. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5967.9800000000005s)]
*  What is that one on the right? [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5971.18s)]
*  Beverage? [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5972.5s)]
*  So they made an infuser so that you could smoke the drink. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5973.5s)]
*  Oh my God, don't do it. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5977.02s)]
*  Don't do it, don't do it. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5978.740000000001s)]
*  You know what I fucked up once? [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5980.320000000001s)]
*  This weed shop near my house had those Keurig cups. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5981.62s)]
*  Their coffee, it was coffee mixed with hash oil. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5985.88s)]
*  Oh man. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5988.38s)]
*  Dude, I would drink a cup of coffee and not even notice [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5990.54s)]
*  and almost kind of forget that it had the hash oil in it. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5994.38s)]
*  And then an hour later, I'm reading minds. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=5997.5s)]
*  An hour later, I'm seeing intentions in people. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6000.54s)]
*  I'm feeling tenseness and relaxation. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6003.34s)]
*  I'm like, whoa, this is so strong. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6006.46s)]
*  Edibles are so fucking strong. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6009.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, they are, man. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6011.78s)]
*  You gotta be looking at the milligrams [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6013.179999999999s)]
*  on the package per piece. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6016.0199999999995s)]
*  Like for us, we've been doing like [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6019.139999999999s)]
*  RSO and full spectrum hemp oil. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6022.0599999999995s)]
*  For me, I use it for sleep, right? [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6025.26s)]
*  Because I never, [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6026.94s)]
*  for me, I've been an insomniac forever. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6028.98s)]
*  So it's hard for me to get full REM sleep, right? [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6031.299999999999s)]
*  Do you take something to go to sleep every night? [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6035.54s)]
*  I never did, but my boy put me onto the full spectrum oil. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6037.219999999999s)]
*  Because I always thought, oh, I smoke weed. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6041.099999999999s)]
*  What do I need that for? [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6042.86s)]
*  But it's different. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6043.9s)]
*  It's different. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6044.98s)]
*  Man, so he told me, because most of the time, [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6045.82s)]
*  they come in the syringes. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6048.62s)]
*  I'm sure you've seen them. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6050.179999999999s)]
*  There's the amber color ones, which are, [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6052.099999999999s)]
*  it's full spectrum hemp oil, full spectrum oil, [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6054.94s)]
*  but it's pressed. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6058.3s)]
*  Right. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6059.38s)]
*  That's how it's extracted, and that's why it looks amber. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6060.22s)]
*  The one that's darker is through alcohol. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6064.7s)]
*  And so that one, when you see the syringe, it looks dark. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6069.3s)]
*  It looks ugly, but it's effective, right? [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6071.9800000000005s)]
*  So they tell you, if you're using it for medical purposes, [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6074.58s)]
*  eventually you wanna get to the full syringe. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6079.22s)]
*  This is like weed steroids. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6082.62s)]
*  Right, like when you're using it, [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6084.9400000000005s)]
*  so cancer patients, when they're starting to use this, [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6087.54s)]
*  they tell them to use, they go with micro dosage, right? [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6090.58s)]
*  So like a kernel, a rice kernel. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6095.26s)]
*  And you work your way up, your tolerance, [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6098.1s)]
*  you work your way up to eventually being able [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6100.06s)]
*  to take the whole syringe. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6102.38s)]
*  But that's when you're using it for a treatment [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6104.78s)]
*  for cancer and other serious things. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6107.9s)]
*  For us, I'm using it for sleep, right? [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6110.9s)]
*  I was doing the kernel, and I said, [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6115.9s)]
*  okay, I could feel it, but I don't really feel it, feel it. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6117.9s)]
*  So I went up in dosage, right? [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6121.42s)]
*  And I started going up a little bit, [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6124.34s)]
*  and one day, I really did it to myself, right? [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6126.02s)]
*  Like I keep them in the fridge to keep them fresh [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6130.58s)]
*  and stuff like that, but they're a little bit hard [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6133.86s)]
*  to get through the syringe because it's oil. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6136.34s)]
*  So it's a little, you gotta warm it up [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6138.34s)]
*  for it to go through the syringe quicker. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6142.3s)]
*  Because I put them in gel caps. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6144.7s)]
*  But this was before I started putting them in gel caps, [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6146.42s)]
*  right, so I'm like about to hit myself with the dose, right? [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6149.18s)]
*  And I'm pushing a little bit harder than I should, [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6153.54s)]
*  boom, the whole damn thing goes in, [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6155.98s)]
*  and I was on for the ride. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6158.78s)]
*  But I tell you, I had the best sleep of my life, [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6162.54s)]
*  and that's when I was like, okay, [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6164.86s)]
*  maybe I'll just take a little bit more. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6166.18s)]
*  So I start putting like 400 to 500 milligrams [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6167.7s)]
*  in the gel caps, and I'm popping them, [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6172.66s)]
*  and I'm like full sleep. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6175.099999999999s)]
*  But you have to time them out proper. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6177.7s)]
*  For me, the way they hit me is I could take the RSO [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6179.94s)]
*  and like let's just say 7 p.m., [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6183.38s)]
*  and I'll start feeling it around 11, 11.30. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6186.18s)]
*  And then by the time I go to sleep, boom, I'm good. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6189.46s)]
*  If I take it at nine, I don't feel it. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6193.3s)]
*  I'll go to sleep, it'll hit me around three in the morning [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6197.74s)]
*  and wake me the fuck up and say I'm here, [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6200.3s)]
*  like the RSO has arrived. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6203.860000000001s)]
*  You'll go back to sleep, but when you wake up, [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6205.900000000001s)]
*  you're gonna be high all that morning. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6208.820000000001s)]
*  Like I didn't even need to smoke. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6210.66s)]
*  The morning that that happened, I was like, [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6212.78s)]
*  I didn't even wanna touch a joint. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6214.46s)]
*  I was still so fucking high that I was like, ah. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6215.860000000001s)]
*  That's one of the problems with these kids today. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6220.38s)]
*  They're going too hard, and they're gonna come up [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6222.860000000001s)]
*  with a way to make it even more powerful. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6225.3s)]
*  You know they are, all those psycho botanists are out there. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6227.14s)]
*  Fucking with the flowers. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6230.0199999999995s)]
*  I don't know what the real numbers are [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6231.98s)]
*  because they say there was always really strong weed [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6233.5s)]
*  back in the day. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6235.62s)]
*  You just had to get really strong weed, [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6236.46s)]
*  but there was a lot of whack weed. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6237.66s)]
*  But now there's no whack weed. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6239.1s)]
*  There's very little whack weed. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6240.38s)]
*  I mean, it's still out there, but you would have to find it. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6241.7s)]
*  You gotta go looking for it. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6244.22s)]
*  Yeah, you gotta go looking for it. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6245.0599999999995s)]
*  They started selling a milder weed for some folks. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6246.3s)]
*  I've seen that, where people say, I just want a light weed. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6249.26s)]
*  Do you know anything that's light? [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6252.42s)]
*  This is mild THC, which is probably strong. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6254.14s)]
*  You don't wanna sell everybody moonshine. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6257.22s)]
*  Yeah, because everybody gets, well, [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6258.86s)]
*  people that ain't used to it, [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6260.94s)]
*  that they don't have the tolerance yet, [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6262.179999999999s)]
*  they catch the anxieties and have a bad experience, [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6263.58s)]
*  and then they don't want it again. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6266.099999999999s)]
*  Your budtenders have to know this. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6270.219999999999s)]
*  When they're- [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6271.94s)]
*  Budtenders. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6272.78s)]
*  Yeah, that's at the dispensaries. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6273.62s)]
*  Your budtenders have to know this [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6275.82s)]
*  to explain this to somebody. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6277.46s)]
*  Ask them questions. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6280.099999999999s)]
*  Is this your first time at a dispensary? [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6281.099999999999s)]
*  What do you, how are you looking to feel? [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6283.38s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6287.099999999999s)]
*  Ask the proper questions [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6287.94s)]
*  so that you don't blow this person out [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6289.58s)]
*  and ruin the experience. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6292.38s)]
*  And maybe if they're taking it, [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6293.74s)]
*  because they don't wanna do pharmaceuticals [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6295.94s)]
*  and they wanna try using it [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6298.0599999999995s)]
*  for medicinal purposes, [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6302.74s)]
*  you don't wanna push them away from that [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6303.98s)]
*  because they're looking at this for an alternative. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6306.3s)]
*  And if you're just trying to blow them out [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6309.42s)]
*  and get them high and you're not even focused in [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6310.98s)]
*  on what they're there for, [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6313.3s)]
*  I mean, you lost someone. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6315.38s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6316.900000000001s)]
*  So it all boils down to education [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6317.74s)]
*  and the willingness to do that. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6321.62s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6324.42s)]
*  That you gotta train some of these, [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6325.9800000000005s)]
*  a lot of these dispensaries train their budtenders in this. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6327.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, there should be some sort of a certificate [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6331.58s)]
*  that you have to earn to know what the fuck is. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6333.46s)]
*  You can't over-prescribe. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6336.06s)]
*  You gotta understand sober people too [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6339.1s)]
*  who have never tried it before. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6341.62s)]
*  It's like, oh, the dispenser, well, it's legal now. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6342.900000000001s)]
*  Why don't I try it? [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6344.86s)]
*  And they go in there, [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6345.86s)]
*  you don't blow their fucking head off in one shot. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6346.7s)]
*  And most people, if the budtender is not educated in this way [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6348.94s)]
*  or just doesn't give a fuck and it's just a job [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6355.0199999999995s)]
*  and you're not even really a smoker yourself, [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6357.38s)]
*  they'll do that to somebody. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6360.66s)]
*  Oh no. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6362.219999999999s)]
*  Because either they don't know or just they don't care. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6363.0599999999995s)]
*  Funzies. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6365.34s)]
*  Yeah, they don't care. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6366.16s)]
*  What would you tell someone if they had never, [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6367.54s)]
*  if they were sane, no mental health problems, [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6370.099999999999s)]
*  never tried any edibles before? [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6372.62s)]
*  What would you say, like 10 milligrams? [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6375.54s)]
*  10 milligrams. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6376.9s)]
*  That's good, right? [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6377.74s)]
*  Yeah, that's perfect. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6378.58s)]
*  That's like, ooh, nice. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6379.58s)]
*  Because they're gonna feel it, [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6380.58s)]
*  but it's not gonna be overwhelming. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6381.94s)]
*  Why? [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6383.58s)]
*  It's a comforting little hug from marijuana. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6384.42s)]
*  Like, hey, hey friend. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6386.18s)]
*  When you get used to that, bump it up to 20. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6388.38s)]
*  20 though can get slippery. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6391.7s)]
*  Yeah, 20 can get slippery. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6393.18s)]
*  That's why you gotta build your tolerance to that. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6394.5s)]
*  I remember they used to have those breast trips. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6396.98s)]
*  Remember the breast trips? [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6398.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6399.86s)]
*  Bro. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6400.7s)]
*  Bro. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6402.98s)]
*  I took one with Tommy, Tom Segura, [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6404.18s)]
*  and he was almost gonna tell, [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6407.46s)]
*  by the time the plane was taking off, he was already gone. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6409.3s)]
*  And he was almost gonna tell him to stop the plane. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6411.9s)]
*  He wanted to get off. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6413.94s)]
*  He said he was fighting the urge [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6415.5s)]
*  to tell him to stop the plane. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6416.94s)]
*  I'm like, oh my God, thank God you didn't. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6418.38s)]
*  Imagine if you got, I gotta get off this plane. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6421.66s)]
*  If you're fucking just feeling, [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6424.18s)]
*  sometimes people are that close to losing it. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6425.62s)]
*  But by the time we landed, wherever the fuck we were going, [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6428.66s)]
*  I think we were going to New York, [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6431.14s)]
*  somewhere it was a long flight. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6432.900000000001s)]
*  By the time we landed, he was okay. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6434.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6436.1s)]
*  But he was like, dude, he looked over me, [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6436.9400000000005s)]
*  he goes, that was touch and go. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6439.06s)]
*  I almost told him to stop the plane. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6440.22s)]
*  I go, no. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6441.58s)]
*  You could go to the uncomfortable levels. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6442.74s)]
*  This is for sure. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6446.3s)]
*  I've been there. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6448.02s)]
*  Meanwhile, I was on a plane once, [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6449.18s)]
*  and I gave something to John Jones, [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6450.66s)]
*  and he took two of them. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6453.26s)]
*  And just smiled. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6455.18s)]
*  I go, don't take both of them at once. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6456.02s)]
*  He goes, oh my God damn it, John Jones. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6457.14s)]
*  We were all just on that plane, but John was smiling. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6461.34s)]
*  But I guess when you're the baddest motherfucker on Earth, [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6464.26s)]
*  what do you gotta worry about? [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6466.14s)]
*  What do you gotta worry about? [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6466.9800000000005s)]
*  He's having the time of his life. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6467.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6469.42s)]
*  And you think that fight's gonna happen with him? [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6470.26s)]
*  Yes, with Cyril Gahn. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6472.06s)]
*  Man, that's gonna be something. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6473.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's in March. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6474.66s)]
*  Yeah, I'm sad that he's not fighting Francis Ngannou, [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6475.7s)]
*  but I'm happy he's fighting Cyril Gahn. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6478.38s)]
*  I'm happy to see him back, and I'm happy to see that fight. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6480.06s)]
*  That's a legit heavyweight who's a dynamic striker. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6482.3s)]
*  That Cyril Gahn guy is fucking deadly. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6486.14s)]
*  He's sick with it, man. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6488.42s)]
*  He's so good as a striker. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6490.0199999999995s)]
*  His striking is so beautiful. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6491.94s)]
*  Have you watched that knockout of Tai Tu Iwasa? [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6493.62s)]
*  Did you see that fight? [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6495.74s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6496.58s)]
*  Dude. Ridiculous. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6497.419999999999s)]
*  Dude, those combinations. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6498.259999999999s)]
*  And Tai Tu Iwasa was throwing hammers too. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6499.379999999999s)]
*  I mean, Tai was firing back too. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6502.139999999999s)]
*  And for a big guy, he's light on his feet. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6505.78s)]
*  Very light on his feet. He can move. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6507.86s)]
*  His footwork is really good. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6509.139999999999s)]
*  It's very different. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6510.74s)]
*  He's very different than any other heavyweight in the UFC. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6511.58s)]
*  He's really light on his feet, [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6514.82s)]
*  and he attacks a lot with his front leg. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6516.74s)]
*  He stabs you in the stomach with his front leg. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6518.46s)]
*  He does it from a weird stance too. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6520.86s)]
*  He stands sideways, and then when he throws his front kick, [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6522.82s)]
*  it's almost like a twisting kick. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6525.82s)]
*  He twists out and stabs you in the stomach. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6527.74s)]
*  So he's totally sideways, but he can still front kick you. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6529.62s)]
*  It's almost like a karate type of technique or something. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6532.22s)]
*  In Taekwondo, they had a twisting kick. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6535.9s)]
*  You do it like that. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6537.9800000000005s)]
*  Not very many people got real good at it. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6539.46s)]
*  It was a staple. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6541.58s)]
*  Yeah, it's outward. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6542.7s)]
*  It's a weird twist. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6546.02s)]
*  Guys have landed it and knocked people out with it. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6548.7s)]
*  It's awkward. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6550.7s)]
*  It's weird because you're throwing a kick. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6551.54s)]
*  Instead of throwing it up and straight, [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6553.58s)]
*  you're throwing it at a right angle with your right leg. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6554.94s)]
*  But he hits people in the stomach with that. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6558.0199999999995s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6560.66s)]
*  He does it all the time. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6561.5s)]
*  And he's the only one I've ever seen do it. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6562.339999999999s)]
*  So if you were in training camp with him, [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6563.98s)]
*  you'd probably have to adjust to that. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6566.54s)]
*  Like, oh shit. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6568.259999999999s)]
*  When someone has a really good front leg, [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6569.46s)]
*  he can fuck a lot of people up. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6571.5s)]
*  And as a heavyweight, [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6572.7s)]
*  he's probably one of the best front legs ever. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6573.54s)]
*  It's going to be an interesting fight [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6576.62s)]
*  because of the way John attacks on that front leg too. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6578.9s)]
*  Yeah, John's very good at chopping at those legs. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6582.22s)]
*  Yeah, the unorthodox kicks he lays down every now and then. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6586.18s)]
*  Also, John's wrestling is out of this world. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6590.58s)]
*  He took down Daniel Cormier. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6593.82s)]
*  That's all you need to know. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6596.42s)]
*  He took down Daniel Cormier. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6597.9s)]
*  I mean. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6599.62s)]
*  That's a big fucking deal. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6600.46s)]
*  He's the baddest motherfucker out there. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6602.0199999999995s)]
*  That's what they say, right? [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6604.26s)]
*  I'm just so curious to see him come back [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6606.3s)]
*  because you got to think three years out, [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6607.74s)]
*  building up his frame, becoming a heavyweight, [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6610.82s)]
*  doing it the right way, doing it slowly, [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6612.78s)]
*  getting accustomed to the extra mass. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6615.02s)]
*  Do you feel like he's doing like [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6617.66s)]
*  what Evander Holyfield did before he became a heavyweight [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6619.9s)]
*  because Evander was a cruiserweight [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6622.66s)]
*  before he became a heavyweight? [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6624.18s)]
*  Yeah, I believe Evander worked. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6625.9800000000005s)]
*  Did he work with Mackie Shilstone [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6627.78s)]
*  or was that the guy who worked with Leon Spinks? [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6629.54s)]
*  There's a famous fitness trainer who worked with him. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6631.94s)]
*  Who bulked him out. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6636.14s)]
*  Who bulked Evander up and they did it hardcore. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6636.9800000000005s)]
*  And a lot of people were criticizing it [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6639.02s)]
*  because in the old school boxing mentality, [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6641.38s)]
*  you weren't supposed to lift weights [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6644.22s)]
*  because lifting weights would slow you down. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6645.74s)]
*  And they thought that wasn't correct [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6648.06s)]
*  and it was like now we know it's not correct. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6650.74s)]
*  But back then fighters didn't lift weights. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6652.78s)]
*  Lee Haney trained him too. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6656.66s)]
*  That's crazy. Oh shit. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6658.46s)]
*  But I think, I don't think it was just Lee Haney. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6659.46s)]
*  There was this guy that he worked with [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6663.22s)]
*  that was famous. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6665.5s)]
*  Fred Hatfield overhauled, yeah. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6666.339999999999s)]
*  So it looks like Lee Haney definitely helped him. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6672.9s)]
*  Lee Haney definitely helped him. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6675.7s)]
*  And then there was this other guy. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6676.94s)]
*  And then there was another guy that did it [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6677.9s)]
*  with Michael Spinks too. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6678.94s)]
*  I think that was Mackie Shilstone. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6679.78s)]
*  Same deal. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6680.9s)]
*  Michael Spinks was a light heavyweight champion, [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6681.74s)]
*  went up and beat Larry Holmes. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6683.7s)]
*  That's right. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6685.0599999999995s)]
*  And that's how they did it. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6685.9s)]
*  It's crazy how they worked their way up like that [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6687.219999999999s)]
*  because Evander, he was in there fighting monsters. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6689.74s)]
*  So was Mike. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6693.0599999999995s)]
*  When you think about how big those guys were [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6693.9s)]
*  in comparison to the guys they were fighting. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6695.98s)]
*  Dude, Mike and his prime was like 220, right? [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6699.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6702.0599999999995s)]
*  I mean, with Mike, would people forget, [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6702.9s)]
*  everybody remembers the knockouts. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6705.219999999999s)]
*  Everybody remembers the destruction, [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6706.98s)]
*  but people don't remember the head movement. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6708.339999999999s)]
*  And the footwork. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6710.7s)]

*  And it's a sport. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6997.4s)]
*  People have connected it to like- [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=6999.64s)]
*  They're athletes. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7001.5199999999995s)]
*  Just being, yeah, they are athletes. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7002.36s)]
*  They're entertainment athletes. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7004.48s)]
*  Know what I mean? [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7006.84s)]
*  Let me ask you this. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7007.96s)]
*  When did that happen? [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7008.8s)]
*  I believe it's slated to go into the Olympics [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7010.32s)]
*  for this next run. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7014.4s)]
*  But when did these guys become this athletic? [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7015.92s)]
*  Oh. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7018.44s)]
*  Because it didn't used to always be like that, right? [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7019.28s)]
*  I think as every art form evolves, [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7020.88s)]
*  I think they just started challenging themselves [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7026.28s)]
*  and trying different things and seeing what [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7028.639999999999s)]
*  cats were doing on the gymnastic floor. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7032.12s)]
*  Trying to figure out how do I develop these new moves [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7034.88s)]
*  and stuff like that and just trying to take it [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7037.84s)]
*  to a new level and I think they discovered within that [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7040.84s)]
*  that they could do these power type moves as a part of it [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7044.04s)]
*  because you didn't see a lot of the freezing [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7047.76s)]
*  that you see now where he's pausing and holding that up. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7049.56s)]
*  It was all about the movement on the floor, [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7054.16s)]
*  like the spins to the head, the hands, [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7056.04s)]
*  and up top when you're doing a 1990 or whatever. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7058.0s)]
*  You see a lot of that in the combinations. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7062.12s)]
*  But now you're seeing more strength [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7065.12s)]
*  along with those combinations. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7068.08s)]
*  It's a mixture of the combinations you see [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7070.6s)]
*  of the aerial moves or the floor moves [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7072.08s)]
*  into a power move that he did on his fingers like that. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7075.24s)]
*  That's the shit they're adding now. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7079.56s)]
*  Where before it was all just combinations. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7081.76s)]
*  There was no power style moves like that that existed. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7083.64s)]
*  I don't know where it came from, man. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7088.16s)]
*  I just know that you see the way that they do this. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7090.0s)]
*  They just, the fact that they kept it going. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7094.76s)]
*  There was no place to go but evolve [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7100.04s)]
*  and do some different things. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7101.56s)]
*  What were you just showing us, Jamie? [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7103.12s)]
*  He had polio when he was a kid. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7104.24s)]
*  That same guy? [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7105.8s)]
*  Yeah. What? [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7106.88s)]
*  He's turned his disability into an advantage, he says. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7108.280000000001s)]
*  He said he contracted polio when he was three years old. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7110.84s)]
*  The difference between me and the other kids [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7113.4800000000005s)]
*  became evident when I realized [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7115.320000000001s)]
*  that I couldn't run as fast as them, [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7117.24s)]
*  but I've never given in to focus on sports [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7118.68s)]
*  like table tennis and boxing. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7120.360000000001s)]
*  When I played football, I was the goalkeeper. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7122.64s)]
*  Whenever people would make me feel [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7126.6s)]
*  like I couldn't do something, [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7128.24s)]
*  I worked extra hard to prove them wrong, [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7129.28s)]
*  and then he became this freak street dancer. [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7130.84s)]
*  That's unbelievable. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7134.32s)]
*  That's that human spirit we're talking about. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7135.56s)]
*  Because what he can do is insane. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7138.68s)]
*  Doesn't even make sense. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7140.72s)]
*  Like you just go, where? [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7142.16s)]
*  How does someone move their body like that? [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7144.04s)]
*  How the fuck do you go all the way back and then forward? [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7145.76s)]
*  But those guys got into jujitsu, man. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7149.32s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7151.799999999999s)]
*  Wrestling, jujitsu, any of that. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7152.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7155.28s)]
*  Their abilities are crazy. [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7156.719999999999s)]
*  It's great that they're finally getting recognized for that [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7159.12s)]
*  by putting them into the Olympics somewhere. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7162.12s)]
*  Oh, for sure. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7167.48s)]
*  I mean, it's so wild to watch, too. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7168.32s)]
*  It's so easily recognizable how impressive it is. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7169.599999999999s)]
*  It's not like you have to know anything. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7172.36s)]
*  You just watch what they're doing physically [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7174.599999999999s)]
*  and you're like, oh my God. [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7176.32s)]
*  There's a lot of great, great guys doing this right now. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7178.12s)]
*  There's this dude named B-Boy Pocket from South Korea. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7181.88s)]
*  Oh yeah, we've talked about him on the podcast. [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7185.08s)]
*  Oh man. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7186.76s)]
*  Insane. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7187.599999999999s)]
*  He is crazy. [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7188.44s)]
*  I put him on my Instagram page. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7189.36s)]
*  It doesn't even make sense. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7190.84s)]
*  His legs look like baseball bats just whipping around [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7192.2s)]
*  when he does his moves. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7195.28s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7196.32s)]
*  Yeah, pull up some of that dude's stuff. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7197.16s)]
*  His stuff is, it doesn't even make sense [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7199.599999999999s)]
*  like how he's able to move his body. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7203.36s)]
*  It's like he's defying gravity. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7205.12s)]
*  Yeah, how do you not put this in the Olympics? [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7206.4s)]
*  Look how he's spinning around [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7208.28s)]
*  without his feet touching the ground. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7209.44s)]
*  That's insane. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7211.639999999999s)]
*  He's on his fingertips. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7212.48s)]
*  It's nuts. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7213.599999999999s)]
*  Like the kind of strength involved in something like that [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7214.44s)]
*  is you can't even, it just spun around in his head [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7216.48s)]
*  30 times. [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7220.759999999999s)]
*  He's gonna wear a ballspot on his head for sure, right? [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7222.5199999999995s)]
*  100%. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7225.08s)]
*  He's fucked. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7226.2s)]
*  Yeah, dude, you're gonna wear your head out. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7227.08s)]
*  Hey, this guy, he's got so much ferocity in his moves, man. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7228.5199999999995s)]
*  When you see other people do these combos, [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7234.52s)]
*  they're not as fast as his. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7236.8s)]
*  It's crazy. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7239.52s)]
*  The way he does it almost seems impossible. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7240.4800000000005s)]
*  It's like if I saw this, [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7242.4800000000005s)]
*  and I would assume this is animated. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7243.64s)]
*  I'm like, this is AI. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7246.160000000001s)]
*  This is like an AI person. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7247.400000000001s)]
*  People can't move like that. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7248.64s)]
*  It's like when you see a 3D, a CGI kung fu movie [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7249.56s)]
*  and someone's flying through the air. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7253.4800000000005s)]
*  That's what that looks like. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7255.360000000001s)]
*  Outside the realm of the possible for humans. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7256.92s)]
*  It looks like it's effects. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7259.4800000000005s)]
*  That's how good that guy is. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7261.280000000001s)]
*  It's crazy. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7262.6s)]
*  That art form really did emerge from, [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7264.36s)]
*  when was the first Break Dancers? [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7267.639999999999s)]
*  When was it? [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7269.28s)]
*  In the late 80s? [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7270.12s)]
*  I think it was 70s. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7270.96s)]
*  First Break Dancers? [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7272.799999999999s)]
*  The first Break Dancers were 77, maybe 78. [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7274.2s)]
*  Really? [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7277.5199999999995s)]
*  Between 78 and 79, maybe. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7278.36s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7280.799999999999s)]
*  I know it's late 70s. [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7281.639999999999s)]
*  Okay, so. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7283.759999999999s)]
*  Into the 80s. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7284.599999999999s)]
*  If you look at this movie called Wild Style, [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7287.599999999999s)]
*  it documents that. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7290.679999999999s)]
*  There's another one I think called Style Wars [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7292.52s)]
*  that documents that. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7294.64s)]
*  I don't know when those came out, [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7296.120000000001s)]
*  but I know that it's been around from the late 70s, [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7298.4400000000005s)]
*  right at the birth of when they used to throw [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7301.360000000001s)]
*  the parties at the park. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7304.0s)]
*  I think it's the Bronx and the other boroughs like Queens. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7307.68s)]
*  There was cats getting down back then. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7311.240000000001s)]
*  It just wasn't documented. [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7313.160000000001s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7315.4800000000005s)]
*  So what kind of music were they dancing to back then? [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7316.68s)]
*  I think it was breaks. [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7319.52s)]
*  When they explain it in some of the hip hop documentaries [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7322.6s)]
*  is that guys like Cool Herc and Grandmaster Flash [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7325.240000000001s)]
*  and the other DJs that were like the kings of the boroughs [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7330.68s)]
*  and the DJs, they were taking R&B records that had breaks [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7336.360000000001s)]
*  that were like, you know, to them [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7340.96s)]
*  that was the best part of the song. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7344.96s)]
*  All the rest was shit, but this part is dope. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7346.400000000001s)]
*  So they would go and find these breaks [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7350.4s)]
*  and cut these breaks in the party [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7352.5199999999995s)]
*  and people would dance to these breaks. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7354.44s)]
*  And then, you know, B-boy shit was birthed from that. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7357.08s)]
*  Look at this. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7361.48s)]
*  This dude is doing this in 1898. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7362.839999999999s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7365.599999999999s)]
*  He's gonna do a head spin. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7366.44s)]
*  Oh shit. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7367.5599999999995s)]
*  But how do we know that that's the first time [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7369.08s)]
*  anybody did that? [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7371.639999999999s)]
*  How do we know that like court gestures didn't do that? [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7372.48s)]
*  It could have been. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7374.5599999999995s)]
*  It could have been anybody. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7375.4s)]
*  1877, but it's the music they're doing it. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7376.24s)]
*  Look at his body control. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7378.04s)]
*  Oh my God, this guy's body control's insane. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7379.8s)]
*  One of them contortionist. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7382.28s)]
*  But no, just the ability to go back and forth like that. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7384.0s)]
*  You have to be so strong to be able to do that. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7387.2s)]
*  So that was 1898? [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7389.28s)]
*  That was 1898. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7390.68s)]
*  It says 1877. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7391.6s)]
*  There's a quote of a young man quite alone [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7393.12s)]
*  who was practicing over and over [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7396.0s)]
*  the most inexplicable leap in the air. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7397.2s)]
*  He swung himself up and then round on his hand [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7399.320000000001s)]
*  for a point when his upper leg described a great circle. [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7401.6s)]
*  Wow. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7406.16s)]
*  I guess that's the same break. [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7407.0s)]
*  Well it makes sense that people have tried to move that way. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7408.84s)]
*  But moving that way to music in an organized setting [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7411.32s)]
*  like these break dancing events, [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7415.360000000001s)]
*  that's what's really cool about it. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7418.2s)]
*  That's the emerging thing [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7419.400000000001s)]
*  and that's what's interesting to me. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7420.8s)]
*  I like watching people get better at stuff. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7423.72s)]
*  I like watching the early ones. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7425.2s)]
*  Even that guy, as impressive as he was, [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7427.16s)]
*  if he saw B-Boy Pocket Kim, he'd be like, [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7429.28s)]
*  what the fuck are you doing? [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7431.08s)]
*  How are you moving like that? [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7433.56s)]
*  Even the guy from 1898 could do wild shit that I can't do. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7435.360000000001s)]
*  He would be blown away. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7439.04s)]
*  And it's probably gonna be, where can they go? [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7440.24s)]
*  How much better can they get at that? [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7443.5199999999995s)]
*  It's one of those things where they just gotta [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7445.84s)]
*  try to innovate new moves. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7448.84s)]
*  The way Tony Hawk would innovate [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7450.5599999999995s)]
*  when he brought out the 900, right? [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7452.88s)]
*  And guys like that, they're constantly pushing [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7455.92s)]
*  to create a different combination, [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7459.44s)]
*  different move that no one's seen or a freeze [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7461.48s)]
*  or a strength move like that guy with the two fingers [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7465.24s)]
*  and he's stuck like that. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7469.28s)]
*  I mean, to top that, some guy could probably hold it [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7471.24s)]
*  for half a second, but holding it as long as he did, [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7474.76s)]
*  you gotta come up with something to top that. [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7478.2s)]
*  Because how do you top that? [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7480.12s)]
*  How do you top that? [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7481.68s)]
*  You gotta be as strong, if not stronger, [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7482.8s)]
*  and come up with something completely different, [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7484.92s)]
*  which they managed to do. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7487.32s)]
*  If you just let them be creative, [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7489.6s)]
*  they'll come up with new stuff. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7491.44s)]
*  Just over time, one guy figures out a move, [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7493.12s)]
*  another guy figures out a better way to do that move, [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7495.28s)]
*  and then they're all innovating and feed off each other. [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7497.12s)]
*  It's amazing art form. [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7499.64s)]
*  I love watching it. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7501.12s)]
*  I watch it on Instagram all the time. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7502.04s)]
*  Yeah, man, it's a combination of athletics and art. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7503.5599999999995s)]
*  It's like gymnastics. [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7507.2s)]
*  It's almost the same thing. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7509.48s)]
*  I mean, you're running around to a routine [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7510.84s)]
*  and doing the flips and the tumbles and all that stuff. [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7512.8s)]
*  And they work their floor routine to the music. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7517.68s)]
*  Same thing with the figure skating and all that stuff. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7522.48s)]
*  Break dancing is just as incredible, if not more. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7525.719999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah, just as incredible, easily. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7529.719999999999s)]
*  Figure skating's pretty nuts. [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7532.12s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7533.599999999999s)]
*  I'm not interested in trying it, [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7534.44s)]
*  but look, we're fucking insane. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7535.639999999999s)]
*  Spinning through the air and landing on your skates [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7538.639999999999s)]
*  and sliding around, that is 100% a sport. [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7541.16s)]
*  Hours of work to get any of that down. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7544.32s)]
*  But you gotta think, [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7548.599999999999s)]
*  the guys that do the b-boy shit, [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7550.64s)]
*  it takes them hours to get all that down [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7554.0s)]
*  and to get those moves down and get those combinations down [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7556.280000000001s)]
*  and having the strength to actually pull it all off. [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7559.280000000001s)]
*  I'm just glad that they're finally getting theirs [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7564.240000000001s)]
*  because it's a great art form that was derived from hip hop [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7566.56s)]
*  and to see it now, it's like a world sport. [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7570.68s)]
*  It's pretty dope. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7573.320000000001s)]
*  That's dope. [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7574.160000000001s)]
*  It is dope. [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7574.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it's just amazing that we watched it. [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7575.84s)]
*  We watched it emerge, also with hip hop, right? [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7578.96s)]
*  I remember when I was a kid, [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7581.72s)]
*  when Sugar Hill Gang first came out, [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7582.96s)]
*  I was in middle school, [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7585.08s)]
*  and I remember I was in the cafeteria [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7586.4400000000005s)]
*  and I was hearing, to the hip hop, [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7587.96s)]
*  hip to the hip, hip to hip hop, [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7589.64s)]
*  and I was like, what is this? [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7590.96s)]
*  Like, wow, this is crazy. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7593.400000000001s)]
*  You know, it's dope that the Grammys [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7595.88s)]
*  just recently celebrated the 50 years of hip hop [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7599.4400000000005s)]
*  because it's now the birthday of hip hop, [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7602.96s)]
*  I guess this year, this month, [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7606.400000000001s)]
*  it's been 50 years. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7609.32s)]
*  Yeah, they left a lot of groups out, [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7612.679999999999s)]
*  but I thought the representation was pretty cool, [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7614.32s)]
*  like that they started with the actual pioneers of this, [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7617.599999999999s)]
*  and CN Run DMC and Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7622.04s)]
*  and Rakim and all those guys do their thing [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7625.5599999999995s)]
*  and be celebrated. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7629.759999999999s)]
*  That was kind of cool. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7630.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah, man, people forget about like EPMD, [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7632.679999999999s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7973.0s)]
*  Which was a play off this. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7973.84s)]
*  Oh wow, that's similar. [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7975.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7977.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that does have a similar beat. [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7978.5599999999995s)]
*  Wow. [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7980.16s)]
*  Hey yo man, you remember that shit easy? [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7982.12s)]
*  Did a while back, motherfucker said it wasn't gonna work. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7983.679999999999s)]
*  And it made a bust. [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7986.16s)]
*  Just thought that I had to be in Compton soon. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7987.0s)]
*  I gotta get drunk before the day begins, [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7989.96s)]
*  before my mother starts bitchin'. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7992.32s)]
*  It rides that line. [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7993.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7995.24s)]
*  About to go and damn near went blind. [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7996.08s)]
*  Young niggas at the path throwin' up gang signs. [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=7997.96s)]
*  The difference is, on the West Coast shit, [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8000.48s)]
*  we used more 808 like that, the bass driven shit. [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8003.0s)]
*  Cause it was more, that was more LA. [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8008.08s)]
*  Like in LA at that time, [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8010.08s)]
*  you'd see cats ridin' around with sound systems [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8012.0s)]
*  bumpin'. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8016.84s)]
*  And so when guys like Dr. Dre were making, [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8017.68s)]
*  when they were producin', they were addin' that bass [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8021.28s)]
*  in there, that 808 so that people can feel that shit [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8023.84s)]
*  in their system. [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8027.36s)]
*  How many times does a dude come up to you and went, [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8028.72s)]
*  insane in the membrane? [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8030.68s)]
*  Oh man. [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8032.24s)]
*  Oh. [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8033.08s)]
*  Is it countable? [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8033.92s)]
*  Almost everywhere we go if I catch eye contact. [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8035.72s)]
*  And sometimes if I don't catch eye contact, [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8041.08s)]
*  for me to walk by and then they'll sing it. [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8044.08s)]
*  Or they'll call me Cyprus. [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8048.4400000000005s)]
*  Yo Cyprus! [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8050.68s)]
*  Pfft. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8051.52s)]
*  That's been my name in New York for a long time. [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8052.96s)]
*  Yo Cyprus! [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8055.04s)]
*  Cause sometimes they don't know all of our names, [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8056.8s)]
*  but they know what group we're in. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8059.72s)]
*  So they won't say, hey be real or Dr. Greed. [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8061.96s)]
*  Yo Cyprus! [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8065.04s)]
*  That's awesome. [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8066.320000000001s)]
*  Let's crack it. [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8067.16s)]
*  That's kinda awesome though. [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8068.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8069.280000000001s)]
*  I got a lot of names. [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8070.12s)]
*  Man, I remember when you guys first came out, [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8074.320000000001s)]
*  I was like, this is a totally new kind of sound. [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8076.12s)]
*  You guys had a totally new kind of sound. [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8078.8s)]
*  I remember I found out about it, [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8081.04s)]
*  I wasn't even into weed back then. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8082.4400000000005s)]
*  I was like, why is this weed symbol everywhere? [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8083.76s)]
*  What are these guys doing? [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8085.8s)]
*  These rappers with weed, [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8086.84s)]
*  what the hell's happening over there? [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8087.92s)]
*  But I remember listening, I'm like, [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8089.64s)]
*  you guys had a completely different kind of sound. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8091.56s)]
*  Yeah, you know, the thing was is that Muggs was from New York. [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8095.400000000001s)]
*  He was from Flushing. [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8098.12s)]
*  So a lot of his influence was from New York. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8099.08s)]
*  His favorite production was like the Bomb Squad, [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8102.32s)]
*  which were producing Public Enemy and all their shit. [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8104.799999999999s)]
*  They had some of the most complex production at the time [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8107.5599999999995s)]
*  with bridges and breaks and these crazy sounds [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8111.16s)]
*  and stuff like that. [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8113.5599999999995s)]
*  So that's what Muggs got down with now. [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8115.0s)]
*  When he moved out here, we start hanging out. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8118.16s)]
*  He's introducing us to New York music, hip hop music [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8121.599999999999s)]
*  that we heard. [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8125.759999999999s)]
*  We heard some of it via the radio on KDY, [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8127.04s)]
*  AM station that was playing a lot of hip hop in the mix. [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8130.64s)]
*  And some of it mixed with R&B and soul throughout the day. [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8134.4400000000005s)]
*  So this is where we got our first introduction to hip hop, [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8138.400000000001s)]
*  but Muggs being from New York, whenever he'd go back, [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8141.84s)]
*  he'd come back with new records [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8144.320000000001s)]
*  and he'd introduce us to stuff like that. [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8145.68s)]
*  And so when it came time to working on an album, [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8148.120000000001s)]
*  he had all that influence and being from New York [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8153.360000000001s)]
*  and absorbing all that culture. [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8156.4800000000005s)]
*  It sounded sort of like New York style production [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8158.48s)]
*  mixed with a little bit of LA influence, [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8162.5199999999995s)]
*  especially with what Sen and I were kicking [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8164.799999999999s)]
*  in terms of vocals, [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8167.84s)]
*  because we were using a combination of LA [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8168.88s)]
*  and New York slang merged as one. [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8171.719999999999s)]
*  So that's why a lot of people were confused. [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8174.5199999999995s)]
*  Where are these guys from? [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8176.92s)]
*  You ask people in New York, [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8178.88s)]
*  they thought we were from East New York [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8180.12s)]
*  and they were from Cypress Hills, New York. [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8182.0s)]
*  And people that were from LA, they were like, [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8184.92s)]
*  well, wait a minute, they kind of sound West Coastish. [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8187.88s)]
*  I think they're from out here, [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8190.08s)]
*  but they didn't really know until we came out and said, [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8191.28s)]
*  yeah, we're from LA, our boys from New York [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8195.08s)]
*  and we're sort of a bridge between LA and New York [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8198.48s)]
*  with the sound. [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8201.76s)]
*  So yeah, it was always a New York influence sound [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8202.6s)]
*  because that's where he was from. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8206.56s)]
*  But I think that's what added to us being different [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8208.2s)]
*  because most things that were coming out of Los Angeles [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8211.32s)]
*  in that time or Southern California [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8214.8s)]
*  sounded like gangster rap, sounded like a version of NWA [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8217.359999999999s)]
*  or Compton's Most Wanted or something like that. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8223.16s)]
*  And we wanted to be different. [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8226.48s)]
*  We didn't wanna be in that lane. [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8228.48s)]
*  We felt that was their lane. [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8231.32s)]
*  We need to make our own. [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8232.64s)]
*  So we didn't wanna sound like anything else [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8233.8s)]
*  that was in Cali. [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8237.519999999999s)]
*  We didn't get signed by a California label, [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8238.519999999999s)]
*  like whether it was Sony or any of it. [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8241.64s)]
*  We got turned down here because we didn't sound [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8245.48s)]
*  like we were from California. [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8247.24s)]
*  Isn't that funny? [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8249.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8249.92s)]
*  How short-sighted people are. [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8250.76s)]
*  And it turned out that our, well, we call him Uncle Joe, [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8252.439999999999s)]
*  Joe the Butcher, who was based out of Philly. [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8257.519999999999s)]
*  He had his label with Ruff House with Chris Swartz. [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8261.119999999999s)]
*  He had worked with Mugs on an album [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8265.119999999999s)]
*  when Mugs was in a group called 783. [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8268.039999999999s)]
*  He knew Mugs' potential. [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8269.92s)]
*  He liked Mugs. [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8272.119999999999s)]
*  He saw that he was evolving as a producer. [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8273.12s)]
*  He heard about our thing and he wanted [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8276.240000000002s)]
*  to take a chance on us, where we were getting turned down [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8279.08s)]
*  from every goddamn label in LA. [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8282.52s)]
*  Isn't that funny? [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8286.36s)]
*  They just didn't understand us. [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8287.2s)]
*  They said, you guys are talking about weed? [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8288.320000000002s)]
*  How does this make sense? [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8290.320000000002s)]
*  You got any other songs? [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8293.68s)]
*  We're like, no, we're cool. [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8294.800000000001s)]
*  And yeah. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8296.560000000001s)]
*  I want to get high. [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8297.880000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8299.6s)]
*  We're sitting there, eating lunch, [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8300.6s)]
*  listening to a song about getting high. [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8303.12s)]
*  They're like, what the fuck is this? [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8304.960000000001s)]
*  Or no, we didn't even have that song yet. [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8307.720000000001s)]
*  It was, we were talking about, [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8309.28s)]
*  it was the Get High song on there was [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8310.640000000001s)]
*  Light Another and something else. [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8314.0s)]
*  But Light Another was the main one. [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8316.16s)]
*  And we're talking about it. [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8318.08s)]
*  That's one of the demos that played. [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8319.2s)]
*  You could see the execs just scratching their head. [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8323.0s)]
*  Like, what do we do with this? [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8325.32s)]
*  I mean, like. [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8327.08s)]
*  Isn't it funny that everybody wants everything [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8328.320000000002s)]
*  to be cookie cutter? [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8330.480000000001s)]
*  Like the idea that rap didn't even exist [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8331.720000000001s)]
*  a few decades prior, right? [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8334.320000000002s)]
*  It wasn't even a common thing. [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8335.92s)]
*  And now all of a sudden it's huge [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8337.400000000001s)]
*  and they can't see that maybe there's another [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8338.84s)]
*  branch of this. [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8341.16s)]
*  It's funny that they wouldn't recognize how good it is. [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8343.880000000001s)]
*  That's what's weird. [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8347.52s)]
*  What it is is they don't want to take a chance [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8348.36s)]
*  on trying to develop it because if it fails [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8350.480000000001s)]
*  it's on their back. [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8352.560000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8353.720000000001s)]
*  So they want something that's easy that, [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8354.560000000001s)]
*  like, oh, this sounds like this. [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8356.2s)]
*  We can market it in this lane. [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8358.880000000001s)]
*  This is already a successful template. [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8359.92s)]
*  Let's use this. [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8362.640000000001s)]
*  Oh, they're not using that shit. [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8363.480000000001s)]
*  We can't do nothing with it. [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8364.960000000001s)]
*  So, you know, like it's the development. [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8366.720000000001s)]
*  And fortunately, you know, when we got assigned [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8368.960000000001s)]
*  to Rough House Columbia, we had the power [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8371.080000000002s)]
*  of Columbia backing us up because they sort of believed [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8374.080000000002s)]
*  in what we were doing. [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8378.720000000001s)]
*  Well, they not sort of believed, [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8380.320000000002s)]
*  they believed in what we were doing. [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8382.080000000002s)]
*  And got behind it and allowed us to be as creative [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8383.960000000001s)]
*  as we wanted to be and pushed us. [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8387.04s)]
*  And, you know, along with having Joe and Chris on our side [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8389.800000000001s)]
*  creatively, like pushing our line and saying, [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8395.160000000002s)]
*  hey, what these guys are doing great. [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8397.400000000001s)]
*  We don't want to intervene and, you know, [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8399.28s)]
*  change anything they're doing. [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8401.640000000001s)]
*  Just let them fucking go. [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8402.960000000001s)]
*  I mean, that was everything because, you know, [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8405.160000000002s)]
*  most of the time they want an easy layup. [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8407.04s)]
*  So if, let's just say, you know, [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8409.800000000001s)]
*  there's a group over here that's doing well, [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8413.480000000001s)]
*  hey, how come, why don't we make a record [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8415.4s)]
*  like this over here? [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8417.359999999999s)]
*  It's like, well, why don't you go sign that shit [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8419.16s)]
*  over there? [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8421.039999999999s)]
*  This is not who we are. [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8422.199999999999s)]
*  So, you know, they want you to make it easy, [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8423.68s)]
*  but realistically, it's nothing good is ever easy. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8425.8s)]
*  You got to work toward it and develop it. [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8428.88s)]
*  And fortunately, you know, we got on the team [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8430.76s)]
*  that believed in that. [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8432.88s)]
*  And man, it was the biggest fuck you to all those [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8434.72s)]
*  that turned us down and didn't get what we were doing. [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8439.24s)]
*  They got it now. [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8443.08s)]
*  Y'all got it now, right? [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8443.92s)]
*  You got it now. [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8445.6s)]
*  I can't understand how they didn't get it in the beginning. [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8447.04s)]
*  But I do, because it's like that in comedy too. [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8450.8s)]
*  Especially during the 90s, they were trying to fit everybody [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8454.48s)]
*  into the sitcom dad role or the sitcom boyfriend role. [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8457.36s)]
*  You wanted to be on Friends or you wanted to be on [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8460.8s)]
*  something like that, you know, that's all you wanted to do. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8462.8s)]
*  So that's when everybody was trying to form their comedy [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8465.0s)]
*  for that. [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8467.52s)]
*  One series hits and then like the other networks see it [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8468.36s)]
*  and try to develop something similar to it. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8471.76s)]
*  That's why there was so many like the ERs [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8474.359999999999s)]
*  and the St. Elsewares and all the hospital driven TV shows. [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8476.8s)]
*  People love a good hospital drama. [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8482.199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8484.24s)]
*  What was the George Clooney one? [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8485.08s)]
*  ER. [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8486.679999999998s)]
*  That was ER. [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8487.599999999999s)]
*  They cannot lose. [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8488.439999999999s)]
*  Can't lose, can't lose. [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8489.64s)]
*  The drama, she's gonna make it, she's gonna make it. [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8490.92s)]
*  Oh, then you feel good, you go to sleep. [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8493.48s)]
*  It's something that has worked for Hollywood for so long [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8496.0s)]
*  that they dare not change it. [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8498.76s)]
*  I know, right? [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8500.4s)]
*  What works better? [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8502.0s)]
*  Cop shows were pretty good. [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8502.960000000001s)]
*  People love a good solve a crime show. [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8504.400000000001s)]
*  There's so many of those. [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8506.480000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of those. [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8507.640000000001s)]
*  There's no lack of those. [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8508.76s)]
*  No lack of Law and Orders. [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8510.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8512.12s)]
*  This fucking Law and Order, Peddy Gambling edition. [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8512.960000000001s)]
*  You know, like they have so many editions of Law and Order. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8515.560000000001s)]
*  Special Victims Unit and how many more do they have? [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8518.32s)]
*  Man, I don't know. [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8522.32s)]
*  How many Law and Orders? [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8523.16s)]
*  They have, oh, I'm thinking of CSIs. [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8524.0s)]
*  They had CSIs in a bunch of different cities. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8526.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think there's like six or seven franchises of those. [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8527.68s)]
*  And the Law and Order close to the same. [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8532.2s)]
*  Bro, they can show hardcore shit on TV now. [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8534.12s)]
*  I watched one of those CSI shows [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8536.560000000001s)]
*  and they were dealing with this autopsy [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8538.04s)]
*  and I was like, Jesus Christ, this is regular TV? [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8540.08s)]
*  It's wild, like what people's access to things like HBO [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8543.32s)]
*  and Netflix, what it's done to regular TV. [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8546.880000000001s)]
*  They'll show like gore and violence now. [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8549.640000000001s)]
*  I couldn't believe it. [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8552.400000000001s)]
*  I was looking at this, I was like, when I was a kid, [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8553.400000000001s)]
*  if a guy got shot on TV, they didn't even have blood. [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8555.880000000001s)]
*  It was more suggestive. [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8558.68s)]
*  It was more suggestive, yeah. [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8559.88s)]
*  It was like six million dollar man violence. [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8562.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8564.839999999998s)]

*  Yeah, they just can't get his movie right. [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8883.88s)]
*  Like, his solo movie, like they got it with Ruffalo [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8886.68s)]
*  with when he's in the ensemble, [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8891.039999999999s)]
*  but like, they still haven't managed to get like the hit [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8893.92s)]
*  with the Hulk by itself. [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8898.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8900.6s)]
*  They had a couple different tries. [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8901.48s)]
*  They had the Ed Norton try. [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=8902.8s)]

*  looked exactly like the original Hulk. [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9064.12s)]
*  And he could talk like a super smart guy, [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9066.44s)]
*  but he could turn it on and off. [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9068.6s)]
*  So he could trick you. [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9070.0s)]
*  So for everybody else, like Hulk smash. [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9071.16s)]
*  And then he gets you alone. [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9072.76s)]
*  He's like, hey, dude, actually, I'm Bruce Banner now. [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9073.36s)]
*  Crazy. [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9075.640000000001s)]
*  But he figured out a way to be both at the same time. [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9076.16s)]
*  But you know, if I want to talk to anybody, [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9077.76s)]
*  so I'm going to Hulk smash. [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9079.68s)]
*  That would have been a good strategy. [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9081.56s)]
*  Find that Loki one. [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9083.04s)]
*  From where he smashes Loki. [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9084.56s)]
*  It's like my favorite scene in any movie. [[02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9086.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9087.48s)]
*  What he could do is like so ridiculous. [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9089.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9091.720000000001s)]
*  He could fly by jumping. [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9092.44s)]
*  So obviously, you didn't watch that She-Hulk bullshit out [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9093.880000000001s)]
*  there. [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9096.6s)]
*  Was it bad? [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9097.08s)]
*  I heard it was horrible. [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9098.32s)]
*  I didn't see it. [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9099.4s)]
*  I would not. [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9100.04s)]
*  I refuse. [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9100.52s)]
*  I can't do it. [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9101.6s)]
*  What's wrong with it? [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9102.4s)]
*  Here it is. [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9104.720000000001s)]
*  This is it. [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9105.28s)]
*  Play it so you can hear what he says. [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9107.04s)]
*  Creature, and I will not be bullied by him. [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9109.08s)]
*  Come on, son. [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9124.08s)]
*  How do you not love that? [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9125.6s)]
*  Yeah, that's the one you want to see. [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9126.6s)]
*  That's the one you want to see. [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9129.6s)]
*  But the pants. [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9130.96s)]
*  Those pants make no sense. [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9132.4s)]
*  In what world? [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9134.64s)]
*  I got special Avenger pants. [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9135.52s)]
*  In what world can your 500 pound friend borrow your pants? [[02:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9136.92s)]
*  That scene would be even more terrifying with a giant green [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9145.6s)]
*  dick flopping around while he's beating that dude to death. [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9147.76s)]
*  Yes, it would. [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9153.44s)]
*  It would be terrifying. [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9154.68s)]
*  It would be disturbing. [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9155.960000000001s)]
*  Terrifying. [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9156.84s)]
*  Terrifying. [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9158.28s)]
*  Oh, my god. [[02:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9160.0s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9161.52s)]
*  Fucking Hulk. [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9162.4s)]
*  Hopefully, they make one that sticks. [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9163.4s)]
*  It's funny, because we don't want new superheroes. [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9167.92s)]
*  Notice that? [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9170.64s)]
*  You don't really get too many new superheroes. [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9171.92s)]
*  We kind of have enough superheroes. [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9174.72s)]
*  We're kind of done. [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9176.76s)]
*  Hard to sell new ones. [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9178.48s)]
*  Not in the DC and Marvel universe. [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9179.52s)]
*  It's been for so long, and they developed so many characters [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9182.76s)]
*  to come up with new ones and try to put those over. [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9185.64s)]
*  That's tough. [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9189.16s)]
*  Interesting, though, that they don't do that, right? [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9190.0s)]
*  It's almost like a band that only plays their hits [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9192.240000000002s)]
*  and doesn't play any new songs. [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9195.52s)]
*  Because some bands, they'll tour 20 years after the last album, [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9197.960000000001s)]
*  and they'll just still have all those hits to choose from, [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9201.28s)]
*  and they don't ever write new songs, [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9203.52s)]
*  and the audiences love it. [[02:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9204.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9206.2s)]
*  It's crazy, because some audiences [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9207.36s)]
*  don't want to hear the new shit. [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9209.04s)]
*  They're like, what happened to this? [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9210.52s)]
*  How come you're playing all this new shit? [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9212.480000000001s)]
*  It's a fine line to try to ride that and please these motherfuckers. [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9214.68s)]
*  Yeah, I had a friend who just went to see an artist, [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9220.04s)]
*  and he said he was really disappointed [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9222.68s)]
*  because he didn't play any of his hits. [[02:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9224.52s)]
*  He was just only playing new stuff. [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9226.320000000002s)]
*  And he goes, the new stuff was great, [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9228.160000000002s)]
*  but there's so many classics that they wanted to see him play, [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9229.6s)]
*  and he didn't play any of them. [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9232.0s)]
*  Got to play the hits? [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9232.720000000001s)]
*  You got to play them as much as you might not want to. [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9233.880000000001s)]
*  I mean, for us, we don't mind. [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9237.76s)]
*  I mean, it's what made us who we were and who we are now. [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9240.080000000002s)]
*  So for us... [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9243.880000000001s)]
*  You guys have some bangers, dude. [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9244.92s)]
*  You got to play them. [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9247.0s)]
*  How I could just kill a man? [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9247.84s)]
*  We'll find a way to mix new songs in there. [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9248.92s)]
*  We just won't play so many of them, you know, [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9251.08s)]
*  until they start requesting them, [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9255.04s)]
*  hey, why don't you play this in the set? [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9256.64s)]
*  You got to let it organically find its place. [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9259.6s)]
*  Yeah, you got to let it find its place [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9261.64s)]
*  and let people say to you, like, hey, man, how come you don't add this? [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9263.8s)]
*  You guys always play this over here, but you never... [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9267.8s)]
*  And then we might take that into consideration [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9270.52s)]
*  and be like, you know what? Yeah, we should play that. [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9272.52s)]
*  But yeah, I've learned from watching others, [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9274.24s)]
*  like when you don't play the popular songs in your, you know, [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9277.76s)]
*  the pantheon of your library, your musical library as an artist, man, [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9283.880000000001s)]
*  they're going to shit on you. [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9288.92s)]
*  Heavy. Heavy. [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9290.800000000001s)]
*  Yo, man, how come you didn't play Insane in the Brain or whatever? [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9291.800000000001s)]
*  Like, you could not not play. [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9295.64s)]
*  Yeah, you have to play that. [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9297.64s)]
*  They feel punished. Yeah. [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9299.08s)]
*  Like, I paid all this money to come see you to play that song. [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9300.44s)]
*  It's like if you went to see Leonard Skinner and they didn't play Freebird. [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9303.28s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9305.76s)]
*  You'd be like, what the fuck? Losing your shit. [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9306.44s)]
*  What the fuck was that show? [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9308.0s)]
*  I went to a Steve Miller gig one time because I was a Steve Miller fan. [[02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9309.4s)]
*  I love Steve Miller. I still am. [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9315.52s)]
*  He's the most famous rock star that no one can recognize. [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9317.32s)]
*  But I would not go see him. [[02:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9319.720000000001s)]
*  For a minute, he looked like Russell Crowe. [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9320.92s)]
*  And when Russell Crowe played that whistleblower. [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9322.6s)]
*  Oh, right. [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9326.52s)]
*  Look at that movie. He sort of looks... [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9328.44s)]
*  Insider? Yeah. [[02:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9329.6s)]
*  Wow. There goes Russell Crowe on guitar. [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9331.52s)]
*  Dude, dude, dude. [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9333.76s)]
*  Dude, that's exactly him. That's crazy. [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9337.0s)]
*  Look at that. I would swear that's Russell Crowe playing Steve Miller in a movie. [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9339.2s)]
*  So I was at this Russell Crowe concert listening to Steve Miller. [[02:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9343.08s)]
*  No. So I was at the Steve Miller concert at the Greek, I believe it was. [[02:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9346.640000000001s)]
*  That's crazy. Look, tell me that doesn't look like fucking Russell Crowe. [[02:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9352.560000000001s)]
*  So he's playing and an hour goes by and I haven't heard one fucking hit. [[02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9358.16s)]
*  And it's like he had played a bunch of new shit in covers. [[02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9365.359999999999s)]
*  And then, you know, the hour and a half goes by. [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9369.72s)]
*  And finally, he plays Fly Like an Eagle, right? [[02:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9372.439999999999s)]
*  And I was like, OK, yeah, now we're starting to get somewhere. [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9376.76s)]
*  And he's playing it. [[02:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9382.64s)]
*  And he has this keyboard player that looks like Billy Blanks. [[02:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9384.359999999999s)]
*  You remember Billy Blanks, Tybo Billy Blanks? [[02:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9387.32s)]
*  The type that he's playing the keyboard. [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9390.16s)]
*  And then all of a sudden he breaks off the keyboard [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9393.4s)]
*  and he's he's rapping Fly Like an Eagle. [[02:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9396.88s)]
*  I want to fly like an eagle. [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9400.16s)]
*  I'm like, oh, no. [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9402.359999999999s)]
*  Oh, what have you done? What have you done to Superman? [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9404.359999999999s)]
*  I think no, man. What have you done to the Hulk? [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9406.64s)]
*  Glasses on the Hulk. [[02:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9409.119999999999s)]
*  It was glass is the glasses on the Hulk moment for me. [[02:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9410.92s)]
*  Right. If he if if he had brought out EPMD to rap over that, [[02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9414.199999999999s)]
*  because they use that EPM, I mean, they use that Steve Miller sample. [[02:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9418.52s)]
*  Do do do do. [[02:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9422.48s)]
*  And they did. [[02:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9424.359999999999s)]
*  They did. [[02:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9425.64s)]
*  EPMD did something to that. [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9426.52s)]
*  It would have made sense if they brought EPMD out. [[02:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9428.08s)]
*  That would have been acceptable. [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9431.24s)]
*  But not your Tybo. [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9433.08s)]
*  That's Tybo keyboard player. [[02:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9436.68s)]
*  That was not it. [[02:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9438.6s)]
*  Did he play Take the Money and Run? [[02:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9439.52s)]
*  He must have played that in the story about Billy Joe and Bob. [[02:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9443.359999999999s)]
*  I know all his songs. [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9447.4s)]
*  He probably didn't play it till the second hour after I left, [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9449.4s)]
*  because after he played Fly Like an Eagle, he played another fucking cover. [[02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9453.24s)]
*  And I was like, oh, hell no. [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9457.56s)]
*  I'm sorry, Steve, Steve Miller. [[02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9459.0s)]
*  I'm out of here. [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9460.8s)]
*  You know, because he waited till the second half to play any of the good shit. [[02:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9462.32s)]
*  Oh, OK. And he just he held it to think they maybe contractually [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9468.0s)]
*  obligated him to play two hours. [[02:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9472.119999999999s)]
*  So that's how he likes to do it. [[02:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9474.52s)]
*  You know, most headline gigs are are like an hour and a half. [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9475.76s)]
*  You could choose to play the two hours. [[02:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9479.36s)]
*  But if you're playing the two hours, usually you don't have an opener. [[02:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9481.24s)]
*  So you're starting early and then you may have an intermission. [[02:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9484.92s)]
*  I've never played that type of gig in spite of our catalog, [[02:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9488.0s)]
*  you know, because it's long. [[02:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9491.92s)]
*  But realistically, man, I mean, you know, [[02:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9494.560000000001s)]
*  you got people waiting on on your hits on a two hour show. [[02:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9497.640000000001s)]
*  Sprinkle them through the show. [[02:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9501.800000000001s)]
*  Oh, like, like, wait till this. [[02:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9503.44s)]
*  Yeah. The last half hour to hit them with [[02:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9505.24s)]
*  with all your fly shit. [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9508.24s)]
*  I mean, a lot of us were leaving. [[02:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9510.28s)]
*  We're like, fuck, we waited an hour and a half to hear this one song. [[02:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9512.04s)]
*  Then he went back into a cover like now that in it. [[02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9515.32s)]
*  And we fucking took off, man. [[02:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9518.56s)]
*  I never as I'll enjoy Steve Miller on the radio and whatever I have in my [[02:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9520.48s)]
*  in my library of his, I'll listen to it there. [[02:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9526.28s)]
*  I cannot invest a two hour, you know, like [[02:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9529.24s)]
*  a two hour fucking ordeal of the first hour [[02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9534.36s)]
*  covers in in new songs that. [[02:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9538.6s)]
*  I was just not feeling it. [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9543.44s)]
*  I was like, no, I can't do that. [[02:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9544.6s)]
*  And so learning you went there for a certain vibe. [[02:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9546.08s)]
*  Yeah, I went there for a certain vibe. [[02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9548.32s)]
*  His music vibe in learning that, like as as as an artist, [[02:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9549.64s)]
*  seeing how he did that and how does you know, like how a lot of us were like, [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9553.960000000001s)]
*  oh, this is fucking ridiculous. [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9558.72s)]
*  I never wanted any of our fans to feel something like that. [[02:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9560.960000000001s)]
*  Leave in a Cypress Hill show. [[02:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9564.6s)]
*  So like we, you know, we we definitely will play some new shit, [[02:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9565.960000000001s)]
*  but we'll strategically place it to where it's not bothersome to the fans. [[02:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9570.04s)]
*  Like, oh, man, I want to hit. [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9575.2s)]
*  I wanted to hear the hits. I don't want to hear this. [[02:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9576.44s)]
*  Right, right. Shit over here. [[02:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9578.16s)]
*  So like we're hitting them with hits from the start. [[02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9579.48s)]
*  Sprinkle some new shit, some more of the old shit. [[02:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9581.72s)]
*  And here and there, just so that like artistically, yeah, you want them to do [[02:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9584.44s)]
*  you want them to have the new material, but like they're there to really [[02:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9589.0s)]
*  realistically hear the the shit that they they fell in love with you for. [[02:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9593.32s)]
*  You know what I mean? And you cannot take that away from them. [[02:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9597.24s)]
*  Yeah, I hear you. That's beautiful. [[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9600.720000000001s)]
*  That's beautiful that you think that way. [[02:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9602.2s)]
*  And that sometimes it's good to go see someone live [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9603.44s)]
*  because you get a sense of what you like and what you don't like. [[02:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9605.48s)]
*  You can get inspired or you can get inspired to like not do that. Yeah. [[02:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9607.64s)]
*  Yeah. Speaking of superheroes, right. [[02:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9611.28s)]
*  And not in the lack of development of of new ones, right? [[02:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9614.320000000002s)]
*  Have you watched the boys? [[02:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9620.04s)]
*  No, I never watched. I heard it's really good. [[02:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9621.640000000001s)]
*  Oh, it's fucking good, man. [[02:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9623.880000000001s)]
*  Both seasons, I think they're going on three or four now. [[02:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9626.16s)]
*  That is real fucked up. [[02:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9630.12s)]
*  There's too many shows. [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9631.52s)]
*  It's it's so fucked up because it's like superheroes that are flawed. [[02:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9632.36s)]
*  Like you see DC superheroes and Marvel superheroes and they're [[02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9636.880000000001s)]
*  they're kind of edgy in moments. [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9641.16s)]
*  But it's it's it's unrealistic. [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9643.8s)]
*  Like they show you that there's not a flawed, not one of them. [[02:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9646.28s)]
*  But in this one, oh, my God, it is like the Watchmen. [[02:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9651.64s)]
*  Oh, man, it is like, yes, it is aggressive like the Watchmen. [[02:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9655.92s)]
*  It is fucked up in the best way. [[02:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9660.32s)]
*  Yeah, it was surprising. It's pretty good. [[02:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9662.92s)]
*  OK, I'll get on it. [[02:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9664.88s)]
*  Like when someone told me about it, I was like, oh, another fucking show. OK. [[02:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9665.76s)]
*  But then I watched like the first episode from the first episode. [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9670.400000000001s)]
*  It's like ramp the fuck up like the first episode. [[02:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9673.44s)]
*  If it doesn't pull you in, nothing's going to pull you in. [[02:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9677.84s)]
*  Have you seen zero zero zero on Amazon? [[02:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9680.52s)]
*  I've heard about it. I got to get on that. [[02:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9682.84s)]
*  Bro. Yeah, that one's under the radar. [[02:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9684.880000000001s)]
*  Tommy Segura told me about that one. [[02:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9687.68s)]
*  He was that that is a wild, crazy show. [[02:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9689.16s)]
*  It was too heavy for my wife. [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9692.16s)]
*  It was like too many people getting blasted. [[02:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9693.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9695.52s)]

*  Catherine Jones. That's right. [[02:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9782.4s)]
*  Here's the problem. [[02:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9783.8s)]
*  No disrespect intended to any of these beautiful ladies. [[02:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9784.88s)]

*  Why are you pretending W.C. [[02:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9795.599999999999s)]
*  Fields was this beautiful, handsome man? Yeah. [[02:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9796.72s)]
*  W.C. Fields was a look at the difference between Jennifer Lopez, who's flawless. [[02:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9798.84s)]

*  But for some reason, the acting in that particular one wasn't there, man. [[02:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9815.08s)]
*  Well, I think legitimately they should put prosthetics on her [[02:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9819.039999999999s)]
*  if they wanted to be that way. [[02:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9822.64s)]

*  The kid from Oakland. [[02:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9872.84s)]
*  A big part of her story was that she wasn't attractive. [[02:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9873.84s)]
*  And there was a big part of what she looked like was a big part of the whole thing. [[02:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9877.2s)]
*  And she was a scary lady. Yeah. [[02:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9880.76s)]

*  Like, why are you doing that? [[02:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9910.0s)]
*  Yeah. Why are we pretending she's trying to polish it up? [[02:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9911.04s)]
*  It's kind of because they don't even like when Robert De Niro. [[02:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9913.960000000001s)]

*  It doesn't look like she could turn into looking like that. [[02:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9932.640000000001s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? Like the the bone structure. [[02:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9935.560000000001s)]

*  She was gorgeous. That's nuts. [[02:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9945.52s)]
*  Yeah, maybe that's that's that. [[02:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9947.36s)]
*  Maybe they're having them like portray her as as she was when she was young. [[02:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9949.08s)]
*  Then start adding the fat suit. Yeah. [[02:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9954.04s)]
*  Yeah. You got it. You got to add that later. [[02:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9955.84s)]
*  Yeah. Put that layer, which makes it even more which which was the problem [[02:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9957.76s)]
*  with the Catherine Zeta Jones ones. They didn't do that. Right. [[02:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9961.0s)]
*  They made her look weathered, but they didn't like. [[02:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9964.48s)]
*  Yeah, but Catherine Zeta Jones weather is still hot as fuck. [[02:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9968.16s)]
*  Right. Right. Catherine Zeta Jones. [[02:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9971.6s)]
*  Yeah. Wow. [[02:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9974.72s)]
*  Cocaine Godmother on Prime Video. Yeah. [[02:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9976.12s)]
*  But the real lady herself was like, wow, what a she was. [[02:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9979.24s)]
*  She was no joke. [[02:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9982.2s)]
*  And when you like in the interview, the hitmen and the hitmen were telling them [[02:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9983.24s)]
*  what Griselda was telling them to do is like, yeah, man, you didn't want to be [[02:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9986.84s)]
*  on the bad side. Yikes. [[02:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9991.08s)]
*  Didn't want to be on the bad side or or oh money. [[02:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9993.0s)]
*  Yeah. Don't do that. [[02:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9996.08s)]
*  And again, all that comes from illegality. [[02:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=9997.6s)]
*  All that comes from it being illegal and only criminals selling it. [[02:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10000.72s)]
*  And that's what I mean, that fucking made Miami. [[02:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10004.52s)]
*  Yeah. When you think about it, like so many. [[02:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10008.24s)]
*  Yeah. So many new businesses popped up in that time because, you know, [[02:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10011.44s)]
*  people had money to spend. How many banks? [[02:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10015.4s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, how much real estate companies moving around? [[02:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10017.72s)]
*  How many banks got in on that coke money and how many banks like, nope, [[02:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10021.08s)]
*  we don't want your dirty money. [[02:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10024.359999999999s)]
*  We want only established cash from established businesses. [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10026.24s)]
*  Like how many banks didn't know that they were they're handling cocaine money [[02:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10029.0s)]
*  in Miami in the 80s? Probably the majority of them didn't know it. [[02:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10033.24s)]
*  Yeah. You think so? At first, they probably didn't know. [[02:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10036.8s)]
*  And then and then they realized that they did nothing to change it. [[02:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10040.6s)]
*  I think it's probably the obligation for the corporation to continue this [[02:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10044.84s)]
*  business while profitable and shaky. Yeah. And possibly illegal. Yeah. [[02:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10048.560000000001s)]
*  Is it illegal for them, though? [[02:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10053.0s)]
*  If they don't do they have to investigate where the money comes from to put it [[02:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10054.16s)]
*  in the bank? [[02:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10056.720000000001s)]
*  I think they just have to report that it entered the bank. [[02:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10058.08s)]
*  I don't know if they have to see where it came from. [[02:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10061.08s)]
*  I think that's the IRS's job to do that. [[02:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10063.28s)]
*  But dudes were burying trash bags filled with hundred dollar bills. [[02:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10066.04s)]
*  Yeah. Just put it in the yard somewhere. [[02:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10069.92s)]
*  And that was the dumbest shit because they weren't even stashing the money [[02:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10071.8s)]
*  properly. A lot of that money went rotten. [[02:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10075.08s)]
*  All that all of it that being if you're high on coke and you're digging holes in [[02:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10077.72s)]
*  your backyard, you're not going to remember where those holes are. [[02:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10081.56s)]

*  They had no GPS back then. Oh, drop a pin. [[02:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10086.96s)]
*  Oh, that. Yeah. Good luck finding that. [[02:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10089.439999999999s)]
*  Like one of these guys that are the bosses, they're all coked up and enraged. [[02:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10092.84s)]
*  They don't remember where they put it. They told you the wrong spot. [[02:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10097.119999999999s)]
*  How many people are going to go on treasure hunts in people's backyards if they [[02:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10100.76s)]
*  find out that they were a coke dealer in Miami? [[02:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10104.12s)]
*  Yeah, it's almost worth it. Right. [[02:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10106.68s)]
*  If you buy a dude, he's a coke. [[02:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10108.880000000001s)]
*  A coke guy goes to jail in the 1980s and he builds his fucking mansion. [[02:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10110.720000000001s)]

*  You ever do any irrigation back? OK, thank you. Yeah, we'll take this. [[02:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10121.12s)]
*  We'll take this. It might be a fucking billion dollars and hundred dollar bills. [[02:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10124.24s)]
*  Exactly. And you better be there when they fucking. [[02:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10127.16s)]
*  Peel that shit up because those construction companies are going to be like, [[02:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10130.32s)]
*  we didn't find anything. [[02:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10134.039999999999s)]
*  So you got to be there every day. You got to be there every day like a hawk. [[02:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10135.199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Especially when you know where you got it from. Yeah. [[02:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10138.32s)]
*  Just probably like pirate treasure. [[02:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10141.64s)]
*  Still places that people haven't found. Absolutely. [[02:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10144.24s)]
*  Like what is that one island? [[02:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10147.84s)]
*  There's some island where these pirates went there and they built this [[02:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10149.96s)]
*  elaborate trap like there's supposed to be some sort of. [[02:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10154.359999999999s)]
*  You know, I'm talking about. Yeah. [[02:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10158.24s)]
*  People try to dig this up many, many times. Yeah. [[02:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10161.2s)]
*  Almost sound. I think there was like even a documentary about a television show. [[02:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10164.0s)]
*  So about both. Yeah, I've listened to a book about it. [[02:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10168.08s)]
*  It honestly sounds like it might be nothing because so many people have tried [[02:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10170.08s)]
*  to do this for so long. [[02:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10172.92s)]
*  And there is a structure, right? [[02:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10174.36s)]
*  There's some kind of a thing that was built, but it keeps getting filled in [[02:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10176.72s)]
*  with water. Yeah. [[02:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10179.76s)]
*  They get down to it. That's so they figured out a way to put this stuff down [[02:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10181.039999999999s)]
*  in a way that you could you could get to it, but it would be very, very difficult. [[02:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10185.68s)]
*  But I think then climate change happened. Yeah. [[02:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10191.04s)]
*  And, you know, the shoreline probably changed a little bit. [[02:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10193.92s)]
*  The curse of Oak Island, the curse of Oak Island. [[02:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10197.68s)]
*  Yeah, they got a TV show on this. Yeah. [[02:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10200.48s)]
*  So this is they're trying to dig it. Yeah. [[02:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10203.48s)]
*  It's a season seven of it. So they obviously haven't found it yet. [[02:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10205.28s)]
*  And they still can't find it. [[02:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10207.52s)]
*  So they have these giant excavator crews. [[02:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10208.92s)]
*  How do you get seven seasons out of finding nothing? [[02:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10210.880000000001s)]
*  I was like, you know, if if if Geraldo had that secret, [[02:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10213.720000000001s)]

*  They're still looking. [[02:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10226.2s)]
*  How many seasons? [[02:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10227.52s)]
*  I haven't seen this. [[02:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10228.640000000001s)]
*  This is describing exactly what you got. [[02:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10229.880000000001s)]
*  The legend of cocaine. [[02:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10231.6s)]
*  Oh, is it really? [[02:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10233.36s)]
*  This guy went on a path to find like buried two million dollars [[02:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10234.0s)]
*  worth of buried cocaine or something. Oh, wow. [[02:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10238.2s)]
*  Well, yeah, because when you know your neighbor is the fucking cocaine [[02:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10240.04s)]
*  kingpin and he's gone to jail and he getting out. [[02:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10243.84s)]
*  Yeah, but what do you do if you find it still illegal? [[02:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10246.96s)]
*  If you find two million dollars worth of cocaine and you're just a regular guy, [[02:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10248.88s)]
*  now you're a cocaine distributor. [[02:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10252.12s)]
*  People find it in the water. I've heard of. [[02:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10253.56s)]
*  Yeah, I have heard of that. [[02:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10255.24s)]
*  But you usually turn it in and the government gives you in guts. [[02:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10256.52s)]
*  They give the shit. [[02:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10259.56s)]
*  They fucking dose it out to their friends. [[02:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10260.48s)]
*  They're having a party. [[02:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10262.28s)]
*  All the cops are doing lines off your coke. Yeah. [[02:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10263.68s)]
*  You don't get nothing. [[02:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10266.76s)]
*  You don't get nothing. [[02:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10267.88s)]
*  How much how much coke gets stolen from evidence rooms? [[02:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10268.96s)]
*  If you had to guess, it's not zero, right? [[02:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10272.32s)]
*  It's not zero coke has ever been stolen from evidence rooms. [[02:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10274.759999999998s)]
*  Coke has definitely been stolen for sure. [[02:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10277.24s)]
*  I'm not accusing any cops of stealing coke, but I'm saying it has to have had [[02:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10279.359999999999s)]
*  to have happened in human history. It has to. [[02:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10283.0s)]
*  Like there's no way that it did. [[02:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10285.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, because there's there's cops out there that definitely got drug problems. [[02:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10288.0s)]
*  Well, they say DEA agents, you know, if you were one of them undercover [[02:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10291.679999999998s)]
*  dudes, you got to show you're legit. [[02:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10295.96s)]
*  So you got to go and do those are the guys most at risk. Yep. [[02:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10297.8s)]
*  Imagine you're a DEA agent and then also in your method. [[02:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10302.359999999999s)]
*  You're like, oh shit, I'm a meth head. [[02:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10305.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I had to prove I was real. [[02:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10307.359999999999s)]
*  So I had to do meth to these guys. [[02:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10310.0s)]
*  And now they're stealing shit from the evidence room. [[02:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10312.359999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And I sneak around. [[02:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10314.839999999998s)]
*  So what happened to this guy? [[02:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10316.32s)]
*  He got the cocaine island guy. [[02:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10317.039999999999s)]
*  He got charged with intent to distribute 70 pounds. [[02:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10319.24s)]
*  So he found it. [[02:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10322.72s)]
*  I don't know if you found it. [[02:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10323.88s)]
*  I'm trying to read through this. [[02:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10324.92s)]
*  Well, if they said he's got 70 pounds of buried white gold. [[02:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10325.92s)]
*  Look at this, though. Hold on a second. [[02:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10329.56s)]
*  It says he was charged with intent to distribute cocaine after embarking [[02:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10330.8s)]
*  on a treasure hunt to uncover 70 pounds of buried white gold in Puerto Rico. [[02:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10334.6s)]
*  But does that mean he found it or he was charged because he was trying to find it [[02:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10339.16s)]
*  arrested after he attempted to recover and sell the cocaine [[02:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10344.4s)]
*  that had been buried on the island? [[02:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10347.08s)]
*  So did he recover it? [[02:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10348.28s)]
*  I have to watch the movie and find out. [[02:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10349.44s)]
*  Oh, you got to watch the movie. [[02:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10350.84s)]
*  They gave us a cliffhanger. [[02:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10353.28s)]
*  These fucks. How about cocaine bear? [[02:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10354.28s)]
*  No, I haven't seen that. But that's a that's a true story. [[02:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10356.68s)]
*  I heard that's a true story. [[02:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10359.0s)]
*  Yeah. Bears lead anything, man. [[02:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10360.36s)]
*  The fact that the bear ate the coke. [[02:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10362.2s)]
*  I wonder what it smelled like to him. [[02:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10363.6s)]
*  I wonder why he ate it. [[02:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10365.24s)]
*  Did it happen? Did the bear die from a heart attack? [[02:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10367.08s)]
*  I think that was the rumor. [[02:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10369.92s)]
*  I mean, it probably overdosed. Yeah. [[02:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10372.560000000001s)]
*  Like, I mean, if you're eating coke and you're a bear, bears eat a lot. [[02:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10374.480000000001s)]
*  Like, how much coke is that? [[02:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10378.28s)]
*  What did that take? I bet the bear's mouth got numb as fuck. [[02:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10380.320000000002s)]
*  Yeah. And I bet every the whole the whole snout. [[02:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10384.0s)]
*  I bet they enjoy the experience. [[02:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10388.28s)]
*  I bet I bet it feels good. [[02:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10391.36s)]
*  I bet once you start getting high from that coke, you're like, oh, this is great. [[02:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10393.08s)]
*  And then you're a bear, you're a glutton. [[02:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10397.04s)]
*  So you just dive in there, eat in the whole bag. [[02:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10398.84s)]
*  How did the bear die? [[02:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10402.04s)]
*  I'm looking around. It happened in 1985. [[02:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10403.320000000002s)]
*  85. The story is story was 85. [[02:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10405.2s)]
*  You're like, man, did that really happen? [[02:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10408.640000000001s)]
*  The story was is crazy. [[02:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10410.52s)]
*  A plane dumped dumped the cocaine out for 75 pounds. [[02:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10412.4s)]
*  They found the dead bear. [[02:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10418.48s)]
*  Wow. He had to. [[02:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10420.28s)]
*  He absorbed only three to four grams. [[02:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10421.640000000001s)]
*  Well, that's a lot. [[02:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10425.16s)]
*  You tax. Yeah. What do they think killed them? [[02:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10427.2s)]
*  Oh, OK. [[02:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10429.880000000001s)]
*  His stomach was literally packed to the brim with cocaine. [[02:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10431.08s)]
*  Wow. More than three to four grams. [[02:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10434.800000000001s)]
*  That seems like more than three or four grams. [[02:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10436.8s)]
*  Only absorbed that much. Oh, he'd only absorbed that. [[02:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10439.279999999999s)]
*  So the rest of it was in his stomach. [[02:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10441.64s)]
*  So he literally ate until his stomach was packed like a big coke rock. Oh. [[02:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10443.759999999998s)]
*  Oh, man. [[02:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10449.119999999999s)]
*  Because that shit is probably hard as fuck. [[02:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10452.519999999999s)]
*  Coke. He probably packed it in there. [[02:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10454.56s)]
*  Yes. Guts. If his stomach was packed to the brim with cocaine. [[02:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10456.48s)]
*  Oh, my God. That's amazing. [[02:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10460.08s)]
*  Wow. That's amazing. [[02:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10463.4s)]
*  What was it like for that bear? [[02:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10465.0s)]
*  Just lying there while your heart is literally cracking your ribs. [[02:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10466.84s)]
*  But bang, bang, bang, bang. [[02:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10470.6s)]
*  Now you've got that done. [[02:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10473.08s)]
*  That bear could not understand what the fuck was happening to him at all. [[02:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10474.4s)]
*  You got a literal rock of paste in your stomach. [[02:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10478.28s)]
*  And your heart is going, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. [[02:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10482.64s)]
*  Yeah. Imagine the heartbeat. [[02:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10486.4s)]
*  Fuck. What a fucked up last day for a bear. Yeah. [[02:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10488.56s)]
*  Oh. And then there was a movie that was supposed to be funny. [[02:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10492.32s)]
*  I heard it was funny. [[02:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10494.88s)]
*  Did you see it, Jamie? No, I haven't seen it yet. [[02:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10496.4s)]
*  I guess I'll watch it. [[02:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10498.759999999998s)]
*  I thought about it. Yeah. I'm awake. [[02:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10500.439999999999s)]
*  It's a great idea. But it is. [[02:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10502.72s)]
*  When I heard it, I was like, no, that can't be a movie. [[02:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10505.32s)]
*  And this is my question that I forgot earlier was is does PCP make you aggressive? [[02:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10507.92s)]
*  Because ketamine doesn't make you aggressive, right? [[02:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10513.4s)]
*  It calms you down. [[02:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10515.64s)]
*  So why do we always associate PCP with people being wild? [[02:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10516.359999999999s)]
*  I think they have to be like sort of it's like provocation. [[02:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10520.48s)]
*  I think they're mellow until until provoked. Yeah. [[02:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10524.6s)]
*  I don't want to try it, but like I wouldn't want to be approaching anybody on PCP. [[02:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10529.32s)]
*  No. I can tell them, hey, you need that. [[02:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10533.6s)]
*  No. No. [[02:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10535.84s)]
*  And who knows what designer drug some fucking chemist is going to figure out [[02:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10537.52s)]
*  in the future that takes that to a next level. [[02:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10541.2s)]
*  I mean, imagine if there was no that's probably why I bet is this. [[02:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10544.04s)]
*  Dr. Edward Domino, who participated in the early testing of PCP, [[02:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10549.24s)]
*  documented that the drug produces an adrenaline release, [[02:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10553.28s)]
*  resulting in a fight or flight reaction with an increased [[02:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10556.24s)]
*  high heartbeat, high blood pressure and raised body temperature. Interesting. [[02:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10559.68s)]
*  He said that the effects of the drug can the drug can vary greatly. [[02:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10566.4s)]
*  It can act as depressant, stimulant or hallucinogen, [[02:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10569.64s)]
*  depending upon the dosage type of administration and circumstances of use. [[02:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10572.96s)]
*  On the street, PCP is available as a powder tablet or liquid or in leaf mixtures. [[02:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10577.28s)]
*  It may be swallowed, injected, snorted or smoked. [[02:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10582.48s)]
*  Key factors that determine whether a PCP user becomes violent [[02:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10585.92s)]
*  are the user's personality, the physical settings and the external stimulants. [[02:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10588.68s)]
*  Like what you're saying, like fucking with them. [[02:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10592.96s)]
*  Something fucks with them. [[02:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10595.72s)]
*  And then they go from zero to 100. They get triggered. [[02:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10596.68s)]
*  Yeah. It takes something to trigger them, because I think there's totally [[02:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10599.92s)]
*  in their own world until someone comes in. Yeah. [[02:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10603.88s)]
*  And imagine that you're like in a zone and then the cops [[02:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10608.279999999999s)]
*  come fucking with you. I mean, immediately you're going to be reactive. [[02:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10611.68s)]
*  They cite the case of West Covina police officer Ken Bred, [[02:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10616.52s)]
*  who was killed in 1983 by a PCP user who was unfazed [[02:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10621.04s)]
*  by both mace and baton blows in a powerful display of force. [[02:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10625.880000000001s)]
*  He uprooted a sapling [[02:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10630.880000000001s)]
*  and its eight foot stake, which he hurled at the officer. [[02:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10633.52s)]
*  Then he managed to grab a shotgun out of the officer's car and kill him. [[02:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10637.800000000001s)]
*  Holy shit, dude. [[02:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10641.800000000001s)]
*  Damn. He pulled a tree out of the ground and threw it at the guy. [[02:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10643.56s)]
*  That's brute fucking strength. [[02:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10647.880000000001s)]
*  That's Hulk's mass strike. [[02:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10650.08s)]
*  Are we sure it doesn't make you stronger? [[02:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10651.44s)]
*  Imagine if we had like MMA, but you could take PCP. [[02:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10653.24s)]
*  You could take whatever drug you want. [[02:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10657.08s)]
*  Hmm. I wonder if anybody's done weightlifting PRs on it. [[02:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10658.800000000001s)]
*  I wonder. It's a good question. [[02:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10662.48s)]
*  Because dudes do weird shit before they do PR. They drink. [[02:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10664.4s)]
*  Sometimes guys do shots of whiskey and then do deadlifts. [[02:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10667.32s)]
*  Just something like give them a fucking give them that little boost. [[02:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10671.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I couldn't believe that when I heard that that some people like to do that. [[02:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10674.84s)]
*  I don't think like that. [[02:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10677.279999999999s)]
*  I never heard that. You never heard that? [[02:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10678.599999999999s)]
*  That a shot before they do before they power lift, huh? [[02:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10680.48s)]
*  Could be just crazy people. We should find that out, too. [[02:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10683.96s)]
*  I would imagine, though, like you feel looser. [[02:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10686.359999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Like like some DJs before they go DJ clubs, [[02:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10688.8s)]
*  they'll have a shot and it makes them loose and they feel like they rock the part. [[02:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10693.56s)]
*  They got like the vibe of the party locked in. [[02:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10697.8s)]
*  Yeah. A shot is a nice way to get the party started. [[02:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10701.359999999999s)]
*  Just well, yeah, gets in there quick. [[02:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10704.439999999999s)]
*  The little joke. Boom. Warms the belly. [[02:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10706.32s)]
*  Yeah, it sounds like people have definitely tried this. [[02:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10710.039999999999s)]
*  I'm reading a story right now. [[02:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10713.32s)]
*  The one thing that says it's the most popular post off of a bodybuilding [[02:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10714.72s)]
*  message board, the thread on PCP and bodybuilding and powerlifting. Oh, wow. [[02:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10717.92s)]
*  This is a 65325 power lifter came in high on PCP. [[02:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10722.199999999999s)]
*  Seven percent body fat. [[02:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10726.24s)]
*  I'm going on to see that there are 11 people [[02:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10728.2s)]
*  piled in the back of an ambulance to try to keep them restrained. [[02:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10729.84s)]
*  Jesus Christ. Yeah, imagine they did not come down with sedatives. [[02:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10733.6s)]
*  Oh, my God. They had to hit him with a dark. [[02:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10738.28s)]
*  Oh, my God. Powerlifting on PCP and just fucking roid raging around the building. [[02:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10741.0s)]
*  Oh, man. Probably PCP and steroids, too, if he's that big. [[02:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10746.92s)]
*  Yeah. You got to imagine. [[02:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10749.64s)]
*  So he's on. Oh, my God. [[02:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10750.88s)]
*  He's on the double dose. He's on the double whammy. [[02:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10752.6s)]
*  That's, you know, like he he really thought that out. [[02:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10755.72s)]
*  Like, OK, I know I'm stronger when I smoke this PCP. [[02:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10759.64s)]
*  I'm going to go really get my work out. [[02:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10763.279999999999s)]
*  Or maybe that was his first time. [[02:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10767.0s)]
*  You just sorry, guys, I didn't know. [[02:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10768.48s)]
*  I took a chance. I fucked up. [[02:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10770.16s)]
*  I was on PCP. Lost my mind. [[02:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10771.96s)]
*  I really apologize to everyone. [[02:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10773.759999999998s)]
*  Let's hope do it deadlifts. [[02:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10776.679999999998s)]
*  What about shots to people? [[02:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10778.8s)]
*  People do do that. Well, I'm looking up deeper discussions on it. [[02:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10779.839999999998s)]
*  So says there's no evidence that it increases strength, [[02:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10783.04s)]
*  but because it's a disassociated, do you think that maybe you can't feel the pain? [[02:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10785.44s)]
*  Yeah, probably. Just go through it. [[02:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10789.6s)]
*  Yeah, could be. Yeah. [[02:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10790.960000000001s)]
*  There's a self-preservation part of lifting, right? [[02:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10792.560000000001s)]
*  Like if a lift feels too heavy, you put it down. [[02:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10795.36s)]
*  Maybe if you're on PCP, just fuck it. [[02:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10797.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Let's go. [[03:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10800.640000000001s)]
*  I mean, what's, you know? [[03:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10802.68s)]
*  Well, you know, hey, look, there's parts of the mind that we can't [[03:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10804.44s)]
*  tap into in a sober state that give us different abilities. [[03:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10808.28s)]
*  Right. Including strength, you know, tapping into something different. [[03:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10812.6s)]
*  We're blocked from it. Yeah, I think so. [[03:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10816.6s)]
*  And I think some of these some of these things like PCP and others [[03:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10818.48s)]
*  sort of maybe could unlock some of that. [[03:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10822.76s)]
*  Well, people definitely move better when they're on adrenaline. [[03:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10825.960000000001s)]
*  Adrenaline makes people very explosive. Right. [[03:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10829.28s)]
*  It's supposed to be there to get you to run away from something. [[03:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10831.76s)]
*  Yeah. Right. To get the fuck away or fight or flight. [[03:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10834.4s)]
*  Yeah. Either you're going to fight. [[03:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10836.720000000001s)]
*  You got all this burst of energy out of nowhere. [[03:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10837.800000000001s)]
*  It's a wild drug, though, because like you [[03:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10839.640000000001s)]
*  ideally would want to be in shape and have very little adrenaline [[03:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10842.12s)]
*  because adrenaline jacks up your heart rate unnecessarily sometimes. [[03:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10845.0s)]
*  And so if you're really juiced up with adrenaline, your heart's at [[03:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10848.28s)]
*  170 beats per minute. [[03:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10850.52s)]
*  If you start engaging in physical activity when you're already kind of gassing [[03:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10851.68s)]
*  because your heart rate's already jacked, you're going to get tired quick. [[03:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10855.2s)]
*  Yeah. That happens to a lot of fighters. [[03:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10857.76s)]
*  First time in the UFC. Yeah. [[03:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10860.32s)]
*  First time in the UFC is wild. [[03:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10861.880000000001s)]
*  They gas out in that first round because of that. Sometimes. Sometimes. [[03:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10863.2s)]
*  Not so much anymore. [[03:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10865.68s)]
*  Guys are much better at that now. [[03:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10867.28s)]
*  It very rarely happens now. [[03:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10868.84s)]
*  By the time dudes get to the UFC now, the quality and the level of fighter is very high. [[03:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10871.560000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And you're getting guys that are already very experienced and they just [[03:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10875.76s)]
*  they know how to do it. They don't just just go full blast. [[03:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10878.52s)]
*  Not all of them. It's rare. Occasionally it happens. [[03:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10881.320000000002s)]
*  But when you go through those smaller shows like the LFAs [[03:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10883.960000000001s)]
*  and these other small promotions and you finally get that call, [[03:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10889.24s)]
*  the moment they close that cage, you realize, oh, my God, I'm on fucking paper. [[03:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10892.36s)]
*  There's Daniel Cormier. There's John Anik. Holy shit. Yeah. [[03:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10896.0s)]
*  Holy shit. It's it's it's it's you got to maintain composure [[03:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10899.44s)]
*  and you're calm in there. [[03:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10904.24s)]
*  And sometimes when you're new to it and you're excited and the adrenaline rises, man, [[03:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10905.6s)]
*  it's it's hard to stay composed. [[03:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10910.960000000001s)]
*  I mean, that happens with young rappers out there, right? [[03:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10912.6s)]
*  The first show in front of like 10, 20,000 people. [[03:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10914.72s)]
*  They let's say rehearsed for weeks a month and they got the song down [[03:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10920.0s)]
*  and their breath control is there and they sound great. [[03:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10924.44s)]
*  But the minute they get on that stage and they see the enormity of it. [[03:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10927.24s)]
*  It changes the change. [[03:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10932.720000000001s)]
*  The inexperience makes them forget everything they learned. [[03:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10934.52s)]
*  And all of a sudden, they're breathing heavy. [[03:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10939.6s)]
*  They're trying to keep up with the song. [[03:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10941.480000000001s)]
*  They're not they don't sound like the tone that's on the actual record. [[03:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10943.0s)]
*  And it's all that nervous energy because of the inexperience. [[03:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10947.24s)]
*  And, you know, I would imagine with an MMA fight going through that, man, [[03:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10952.32s)]
*  that's got to be the toughest because like you trained, you put the work in [[03:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10957.92s)]
*  and yet you're gassing out. [[03:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10962.8s)]
*  But you see guys overcome that. [[03:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10964.439999999999s)]
*  They have like a bad first experience and they come back and I get it now. [[03:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10965.92s)]
*  And then you see them like emerge and get much better. [[03:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10969.24s)]
*  That does happen. [[03:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10972.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you see a lot of that now where a guy's getting like, you know, you thinking, [[03:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10972.679999999998s)]
*  oh, man, he's about to get finished. [[03:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10976.279999999999s)]
*  And all of a sudden just changes it all around. [[03:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10977.72s)]
*  I love the fact that you took voice lessons like you. [[03:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10980.52s)]
*  You were like, I'm going to treat this like I'm going to figure out a way [[03:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10983.92s)]
*  to do this the best way. Right. [[03:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10986.800000000001s)]
*  Like instead of just like doing my thing and I'm going to like seek out experts [[03:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10988.12s)]
*  in vocalizations and help me out. Yeah. [[03:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10992.04s)]
*  So smart. Yeah. [[03:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10994.84s)]
*  You know, I think if you got a different sort of voice, right, [[03:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=10996.4s)]
*  and you got to maintain it and not let it get damaged and things like that, [[03:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11001.28s)]
*  you got to find ways to strengthen it. Right. [[03:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11006.28s)]
*  For me, like I knew this. [[03:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11008.28s)]
*  Some of the stuff that was was causing damage to my voice. [[03:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11010.6s)]
*  One was I was smoking blunts and I was drinking whiskey before the shows [[03:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11014.72s)]
*  and things like that. [[03:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11019.0s)]
*  And then carbonated shit like sodas and stuff like that. [[03:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11020.8s)]
*  That whole combination had my shit raspy. [[03:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11023.64s)]
*  And then, you know, the excitement, the adrenaline carrying that over, [[03:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11027.08s)]
*  not not necessarily controlling that to be able to sound right. [[03:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11030.92s)]
*  And, you know, so it was a combination of all that. [[03:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11037.44s)]
*  And then someone referred me to the lady, I think her name was Elizabeth Sabine. [[03:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11040.44s)]
*  She was a she taught like a bunch of different singers, [[03:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11045.08s)]
*  but like her thing was opera and to teach you how to breathe [[03:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11048.48s)]
*  so that you don't have to over project from your, you know, your vocal chords [[03:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11051.720000000001s)]
*  and all that stuff from the throat. [[03:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11055.800000000001s)]
*  And so getting rid of the the the whiskey and the the the blunts [[03:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11057.800000000001s)]
*  and the and the sodas, that was one thing that definitely [[03:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11063.28s)]
*  helped, but like with the breath control and not over projecting [[03:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11066.64s)]
*  and staying in key and tone, whatever, she taught me that. [[03:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11070.96s)]
*  And that like preserved my shit like so that I could sound like [[03:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11075.76s)]
*  what I sound like on the record, even to this day. [[03:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11080.24s)]
*  Like I didn't really like suffer too much damage. [[03:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11082.56s)]
*  Like a lot of people do where like they cannot sound like they do on the record [[03:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11086.92s)]
*  because they've they've pretty much blasted out their shit by party [[03:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11090.76s)]
*  and not taking care of of the muscle, not taking care of the tools, any of it. [[03:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11095.96s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[03:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11101.24s)]
*  So I always respected the fact that I got this gift. [[03:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11101.76s)]
*  So like I'm going to do what I got to to protect it. [[03:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11104.96s)]
*  And that was one thing, man. [[03:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11108.439999999999s)]
*  Like I was going horse every damn every other show, like [[03:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11109.92s)]
*  not sounding the way that I should on records. [[03:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11114.72s)]
*  And when I would hear the playback to that, I'd be like, [[03:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11117.72s)]
*  oh, my fucking God, what is this? [[03:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11121.24s)]
*  And then finally, I reached out to somebody who knew a coach. [[03:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11124.519999999999s)]
*  And they were like, hey, put me on to to your vocal coach. [[03:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11128.76s)]
*  I want to want to try to, you know, strengthen what I got going on here. [[03:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11132.56s)]
*  Fortunately, man, I paid attention to her and I didn't blow it off. [[03:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11136.439999999999s)]
*  Like, what the fuck is this? [[03:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11139.4s)]
*  Because you can go in there like that and be like, [[03:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11141.32s)]
*  how are these exercises going to help me and keep it? [[03:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11144.519999999999s)]
*  But, you know, until you do them and get used to it and it becomes second nature, [[03:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11148.0s)]
*  you don't realize it. [[03:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11151.72s)]
*  And fortunately, I was serious enough [[03:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11152.8s)]
*  to take the advice and do all the practices. [[03:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11155.76s)]
*  And it it preserved my voice, man. [[03:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11158.439999999999s)]
*  I was lucky enough to to get that when I when I did. [[03:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11161.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's beautiful that you figured that out. [[03:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11164.56s)]
*  It's and it's a great message for other guys to like treat this like it's a profession. [[03:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11166.4s)]
*  Yeah, man. It's a beautiful profession. [[03:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11170.48s)]
*  I mean, folks that could sing like, let's just say Patti LaBelle, right? [[03:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11172.4s)]
*  I'm not the biggest Patti LaBelle fan, but she's made great music in her time. [[03:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11176.16s)]
*  But in relation to her tool, which is her voice, [[03:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11181.04s)]
*  I mean, she's taken care of it to where she sounds amazing [[03:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11185.320000000002s)]
*  right now to this day in her 70s, you know, like. [[03:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11189.36s)]
*  And not everybody her age that that that possesses that that talent [[03:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11194.84s)]
*  and has a voice still have a strong voice because they didn't take care of it [[03:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11199.800000000001s)]
*  like she did. You know what I mean? And that [[03:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11203.84s)]
*  that goes a long way, man. [[03:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11207.52s)]
*  If you want to have longevity in this game and you want to sound good, man, [[03:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11209.08s)]
*  you take care of the tools on the flip side. [[03:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11212.12s)]
*  I like the way Johnny Cash sounded in his last days. [[03:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11215.24s)]
*  Yeah, he sounded good. [[03:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11218.88s)]
*  I love that. Yeah. [[03:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11220.52s)]

*  Yeah. His voice like that guy lived a hard fucking life. [[03:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11224.92s)]
*  He sure did. And Johnny Cash lived a hard life. [[03:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11228.56s)]
*  And it was a dope record. Yeah. Oh, sure. [[03:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11232.039999999999s)]
*  That album was dope. [[03:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11234.6s)]
*  It just hearing that voice at the end of his life [[03:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11235.48s)]
*  and knowing that he doesn't have much time left and knowing that he knows [[03:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11238.48s)]
*  he doesn't have much time left. Yeah. And he's singing that. [[03:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11241.4s)]
*  He plays some of that play. Play Johnny Cash hurt. [[03:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11243.84s)]
*  Yeah. And it's a cover, a nine inch nails cover. [[03:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11247.64s)]
*  There's so many layers to kill so many layers to it. [[03:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11250.439999999999s)]
*  And it's like when you see what he looked like back then, man. [[03:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11253.439999999999s)]
*  I mean, he was an older dude, man, an older dude. [[03:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11257.0s)]
*  He was one of the highway men. You know? Yeah. [[03:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPM6a2ZsrFw&t=11260.199999999999s)]
