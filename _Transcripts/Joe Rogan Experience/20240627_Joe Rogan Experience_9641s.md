*  I just fell out of the world into a hole. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=128.24s)]
*  It was wet cement that was not blocked off. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=131.52s)]
*  Oh no. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=134.0s)]
*  And I went down to like neck. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=135.0s)]
*  Oh no. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=136.96s)]
*  So I was just like trying to get out and my stupid ass, I didn't realize how dangerous [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=137.96s)]
*  it was for me to be in that hole. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=142.24s)]
*  I was laughing the whole time. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=143.56s)]
*  I was like, ah, stupid ass fell in the hole. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=144.56s)]
*  And then I had to, I was, the Walgreens right there. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=147.72s)]
*  So I had to go, I bought like some pajamas or whatever they had. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=150.35999999999999s)]
*  And I went home and my parents were like, this is not funny. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=153.95999999999998s)]
*  Like you could have lost your life. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=156.2s)]
*  And then I got this major lawsuit. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=157.56s)]
*  I had to go to physical therapy because my adrenaline was pumping. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=159.12s)]
*  So I didn't know I was hurt. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=162.23999999999998s)]
*  So the next day I was just like, oh, my back was stressed. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=164.28s)]
*  My arms were stressed because I was banging on the ground trying to get out, trying to [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=167.0s)]
*  pull myself to the cement to climb out. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=170.56s)]
*  How did you get out? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=173.68s)]
*  Did someone help you? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=174.68s)]
*  No, nobody was outside. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=175.68s)]
*  I was screaming, but I was laughing because I'm goofy. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=176.68s)]
*  And I'm like, you dumb bitch, how you fall into a hole? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=180.56s)]
*  But I didn't realize how serious it was till after. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=183.32s)]
*  And then my parents, they brought me to a lawyer. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=186.3s)]
*  They like, hell no. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=187.96s)]
*  Like, no, you could have, you could have died. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=188.96s)]
*  And then I just, I forgot all about it. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=191.76s)]
*  I went to therapy for a year and then I got a check. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=193.32s)]
*  It took a year to get better from that? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=196.54s)]
*  Well, you know, with the lawyers and shit, you got to go to therapy while they lit a [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=198.8s)]
*  gate and figure shit out. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=202.72s)]
*  And then did you have any lasting problems from it? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=204.56s)]
*  For a couple of years, my neck, I had a strained back, I had a strained neck, but I was well, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=209.32s)]
*  I was living in for six months in Los Angeles with no job. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=215.20000000000002s)]
*  I was compensated pretty well. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=219.88s)]
*  So that's what got you to LA? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=222.12s)]
*  Falling in a hole? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=223.84s)]
*  That's what got me financially able. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=224.96s)]
*  Now, me going to LA, that's a different story. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=228.20000000000002s)]
*  So did you start stand up in New Orleans? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=231.36s)]
*  Where'd you start? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=234.24s)]

*  Like, I would always like make up these little jokes. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=239.96s)]
*  New Orleans wasn't big on comedy. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=243.52s)]
*  They still not too, they growing. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=247.0s)]
*  It's a growing comedic community out there right now. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=248.64000000000001s)]

*  I mean, we don't cry at funerals. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=258.4s)]
*  We just super, I mean, just dumb. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=260.16s)]
*  My mom cracked jokes when she was punishing me as a kid. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=263.32s)]
*  She would say riddles while she was whipping my ass. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=265.92s)]
*  I mean, it was nothing like, everything was just funny. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=268.52s)]
*  It was nothing ever serious in my family. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=272.84s)]
*  And like, if we, you know, on the weekends, you know, you clean the house, you listen [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=274.88s)]

*  Those little rooms are when you're with a tiny amount of people, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=328.48s)]
*  you get to see what's bullshit in your act. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=331.76s)]
*  Yeah. And it's close and it's intimate. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=333.71999999999997s)]

*  It's probably on one of my. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=351.6s)]
*  I keep my calendars. It's probably one of my old calendars. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=352.72s)]
*  So I don't think I met you until I came back to the store, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=354.88000000000005s)]
*  which was the 14th, 2014, I think. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=357.6s)]
*  Yes. And that's when all the stories started happening about you. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=360.56s)]
*  I was like. Because I'm like, yo, that's the Fear Factory dude. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=363.32000000000005s)]
*  The Fear Factory dude. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=366.68s)]
*  I'm like, what the. Because I didn't know the history. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=368.76s)]
*  So when. OK, so basically I'm I'm like this, this, this, this chick from this, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=370.6s)]
*  from, you know, New Orleans, it's the country. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=376.24s)]
*  You know what I'm saying is New Orleans is a city. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=379.0s)]
*  But I went to school in Tíbato, Louisiana. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=381.32s)]
*  And that's super, super country town. Right. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=383.8s)]
*  Now, I always had dreams of coming to Hollywood, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=387.2s)]
*  but I know how I was going to get there. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=389.52s)]
*  So I was it was just word. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=391.32s)]
*  It was just me verbally speaking it. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=392.84000000000003s)]
*  So I didn't know what I was going to do. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=394.52s)]
*  And then I moved back to New Orleans. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=396.52s)]
*  I was in an eight year relationship with this girl. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=399.15999999999997s)]
*  We broke up. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=402.91999999999996s)]
*  I didn't know how to be hurt. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=404.35999999999996s)]
*  That was my first time ever being hurt. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=405.64s)]
*  So I started following her everywhere. Oh, no. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=408.03999999999996s)]
*  And like stalking her. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=412.76s)]
*  And I remember I used to sit outside in this tree with snacks and weed. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=414.71999999999997s)]
*  You sat in a tree. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=418.84s)]
*  I'm telling you, I was tripping. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=420.44s)]
*  I was young and I didn't know what to do. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=422.08s)]
*  And that I don't know. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=425.12s)]
*  I was tripping anyway. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=426.08s)]
*  Cut all that shit short. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=427.2s)]
*  I'm like, you know how you just got to look in the mirror [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=428.52s)]
*  sometimes and be like, you're tripping. Right. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=430.59999999999997s)]
*  Like, chase your dreams. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=433.15999999999997s)]
*  Like, don't be chasing no female. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=434.8s)]
*  Like, what are you doing? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=436.2s)]
*  So I just had like this epiphany about myself, like, bro, like, get out of here. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=437.36s)]
*  And within a week, I was out. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=442.2s)]
*  I was out. I told my job. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=444.88s)]
*  I quit. I told my mom's. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=446.2s)]

*  And I drove across the country just like that. Wow. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=454.52s)]
*  And that's how I got into comedy, because I had an interview at the comedy store. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=457.64s)]
*  And when I got there, it was like 75 people in the original room. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=462.36s)]
*  And I looked around. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=467.08s)]

*  Yeah. I love I love it. I love it. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1023.16s)]
*  And I honestly did not know what I was doing. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1025.16s)]
*  I just kind of. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1030.32s)]
*  I just kind of fell in. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1033.0s)]
*  I didn't fall into the comedy game because that's what I wanted to do. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1034.32s)]
*  And when I got the job at the store, I'm like, all right, bet you supposed to do comedy. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1036.84s)]
*  I was the type of person I'm like, you know what? [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1042.28s)]
*  I'm going to just write it out. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1044.28s)]
*  I'll probably, you know, of course, I had dreams. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1045.36s)]
*  But I but the way it's set up, like how hard it is and how much rejection is out there. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1048.68s)]
*  I just was like, you know what? [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1053.8s)]
*  I'm probably just going to be a comedy still comic forever. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1055.16s)]
*  Fuck it. Whatever. Right. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1057.32s)]
*  So then I just I get passed in 2016. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1059.32s)]
*  Surprised. I was like, oh, OK, for sure. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1063.08s)]
*  But I had a killer set. My set was super ridiculous. And. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1065.8s)]
*  From that, I got a manager. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1070.6s)]
*  I did this show with my guy, Hamid Weinberg, with Sarah Silverman Company. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1072.04s)]
*  So I got managers through that. It was called Please Understand. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1076.8s)]
*  And then they. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1081.6s)]
*  My managers, Dave Beckett and Ethan Stern, they like, I kid what you want. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1084.88s)]
*  I said, what is that what you want? [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1089.6s)]
*  They say, I was like, I just thought there's like, now you you you you [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1092.08s)]
*  we're about to put your life together now. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1096.2s)]
*  I'm like, I bet I want to do this, this, this, this and this. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1098.24s)]
*  They said, cool. Now it's time to go all it out. Let's roll. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1101.16s)]
*  And I was like, all right. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1104.48s)]
*  So that's when things became a little more serious. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1106.4s)]
*  And that's when I started like really learning the game. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1108.5600000000002s)]
*  But I didn't really know about the road until three years ago. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1110.44s)]
*  And but that but but of course, that was after. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1115.2s)]
*  SNL. And now I went from doing 15 minutes at the comedy store to. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1119.72s)]
*  Oh, no, now you got to do a hour. You on TV. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1125.4s)]
*  I'm like, oh, OK. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1128.3600000000001s)]
*  You got our absolutely. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1130.96s)]
*  No, I don't. How much time did you have? [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1132.64s)]
*  I don't know. 20 minutes, 30 minutes of just shit that I had accumulated [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1135.52s)]
*  over the years. Right. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1139.52s)]
*  But now it was time for me to start putting it all together. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1140.88s)]
*  And every single step of the way while I was doing that, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1143.28s)]
*  I was thinking about you because I remember we had a conversation at the store. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1145.96s)]
*  I would ask you for advice. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1149.44s)]
*  I know you gave a lot of people advice. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1150.4s)]
*  You probably don't remember you told me this, but you was just like economy of words. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1151.88s)]
*  Like. What that mean, Joe? [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1155.72s)]
*  Fuck all that. Get rid of all that fat. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1158.76s)]
*  Get to the point. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1161.84s)]
*  Find out how to explain your stories simply quickly. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1163.04s)]
*  Get to the punch line. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1167.04s)]
*  I'm like, all right. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1168.32s)]
*  So as I'm putting this set together, I got paragraphs and paragraphs [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1169.24s)]
*  of shit trying to describe my joke. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1172.56s)]
*  And I'm like economy words, bitch. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1174.8s)]
*  And then I'm and that's when my comedy started getting better, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1176.56s)]
*  because I'm like, I I'm going to say a sentence. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1178.48s)]
*  I'm going to say a joke. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1180.68s)]
*  I'm going to say a sentence. I'm going to say a joke. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1181.56s)]
*  And if I got to tell a story with it, I'm going to make sure [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1183.0s)]
*  I got references inside of it and act out. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1185.16s)]
*  So it so it could be full and I'll have aerospace in it. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1188.28s)]
*  Yeah. So I'm still working on that, though, by the way. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1192.0800000000002s)]
*  But I'm better. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1194.48s)]
*  But we all are. Yeah. You work on it forever. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1195.52s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, I agree. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1198.16s)]
*  Especially because you're going to always come up with new material. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1199.76s)]
*  So if you come up with new material, you're always working on it. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1202.4s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1204.6000000000001s)]
*  That's why I like doing a little the small rooms to work on it. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1206.16s)]
*  But my small rooms now are the clubs. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1209.4s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1213.16s)]
*  Like, there's no more. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1213.8s)]
*  I mean, don't get it twisted. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1215.44s)]
*  I'll go do some comedy in a coffee shop in a second. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1216.52s)]
*  I'm humble. I'm not about to be. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1218.9199999999998s)]
*  I ain't going to. That's not me. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1220.56s)]
*  You know, but before all of this, [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1222.56s)]
*  my rooms to go by, man, was the coffee shop or a library [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1225.84s)]
*  or the back of a basement. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1229.6s)]
*  I mean, not the back, but in a basement or something like that. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1231.56s)]
*  But I'm leveling up now. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1234.12s)]
*  So but I still don't know what it feels like to like [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1236.6s)]
*  really, truly perform in a big theater. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1240.32s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1244.28s)]
*  I guess like things just kind of turned around for me so fast [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1245.08s)]
*  that I was never put in a situation to go open for anybody. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1250.48s)]
*  So now I just I just got to figure out how to do it now. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1255.04s)]
*  You know, now I'm working up to the theaters [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1260.4399999999998s)]
*  without having the experience of doing it for anybody else. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1263.96s)]
*  As a headliner. Right. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1268.48s)]
*  I'm like, look, this is from the mud, man. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1271.56s)]
*  They got some days I'd be like, Punky, what are you doing? [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1275.72s)]
*  I got to question myself every day because I don't know. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1279.0s)]
*  But I'm doing it. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1282.24s)]
*  Just keep doing it. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1284.88s)]
*  Yeah, keep doing it. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1286.04s)]
*  One day you look back and you go, how the fuck did I get here? [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1286.76s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, yeah. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1289.64s)]
*  They got times I'll be like, Punky, you know what? [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1291.2s)]
*  You still got time to just, you know, that you know, [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1293.72s)]
*  that give your job back at the store. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1296.6s)]
*  You know, because it get hard and but I'm like, [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1301.12s)]
*  my mother didn't raise me to be no sucker. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1305.32s)]
*  So it's like, you know, I just got to talk myself out of this. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1307.24s)]
*  I like, bitch, wake up. Come on. Stop all that stupid shit. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1309.9599999999998s)]
*  You was made for this. You was born for this. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1312.6399999999999s)]
*  Let's go. Yeah, that's called imposter syndrome. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1315.7199999999998s)]
*  Everybody has that. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1318.1999999999998s)]
*  That's a good you have that [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1320.24s)]
*  because the people that don't have that are usually delusional. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1322.0s)]
*  They don't they don't critique themselves. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1324.28s)]
*  Sometimes I wish I was delusional. No. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1326.28s)]
*  Sometimes because these delusional people, they out here fucking up [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1329.0s)]

*  No, this is bad for you. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1335.76s)]
*  Delusional people are weird. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1337.28s)]
*  Like you'll see them go on stage at the comic store and just eat shit [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1338.56s)]
*  and come off with a big smile on their face. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1341.12s)]
*  Like, you're not suicidal. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1342.72s)]

*  And I was very, very my authentic self. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1523.9199999999998s)]
*  So I'm like, get them fucking tapes. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1526.32s)]
*  They're like, we got you, bitch. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1529.04s)]
*  Because I know, you know, but, you know, like now I have this, [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1533.8s)]
*  you know, SNL is my first corporate job. Right. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1537.24s)]
*  You know, well, I got rules to follow and shit. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1540.28s)]

*  you just got to watch what you do and watch what you say. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1547.04s)]
*  And that's a big shift coming from somewhere [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1549.44s)]
*  where you didn't have to watch what you did and you didn't have to watch what you said. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1551.16s)]
*  That's like the polar opposite of the common. 100 percent. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1554.08s)]
*  You know, so you just got to be smart. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1557.16s)]
*  I have to be smarter in a way that I deliver or decide to say something sometimes [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1561.04s)]
*  because I could say something, somebody could take that, [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1566.6000000000001s)]
*  blow that shit all out of context and then boom, that's my job. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1569.08s)]

*  But that's OK, too. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1575.84s)]
*  Even if that happens, even if it does, I mean, you can always be all right. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1577.84s)]
*  But then that's going to piss me off. Yeah. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1581.24s)]
*  But it's like, yo, why? [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1584.0400000000002s)]
*  Why everybody's talking all this drama over? [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1585.2800000000002s)]
*  Simply misunderstanding something that somebody said. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1588.8400000000001s)]
*  Well, it's purposely misunderstanding it like people are doing it on purpose. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1591.1200000000001s)]
*  It's people that just you know what it's like. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1594.8400000000001s)]
*  It's like the world is filled with glass houses and there's just buckets of rocks everywhere. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1596.5600000000002s)]

*  It's like it's it's so easy to bring someone down now, [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1602.64s)]
*  especially someone that said they tweeted some shit in 2009 or said some shit. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1605.1200000000001s)]
*  It's like it's a normal part of human culture. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1610.24s)]
*  Like when you see someone, especially someone like yourself, that's on the rise. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1614.24s)]
*  And now all of a sudden you're doing great. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1618.4s)]
*  People that aren't doing great, they want to chop you down. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1620.2s)]
*  And you know what it's like? [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1623.24s)]
*  Like there's one thing about comedy that's fascinating is that when you start out, [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1624.64s)]
*  anybody could start out, you know, anyone can get on that stage. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1628.96s)]
*  Open mics. It's for anyone, like literally anyone, including mentally ill people. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1631.68s)]
*  Yeah. And so you got a lot of mentally ill people that you're sharing space [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1636.16s)]
*  with and you're hanging out with them all the time and then you start to do well [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1639.48s)]
*  and they get angry at you. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1642.28s)]
*  Like people that have like severe narcissistic tendencies and severe jealousy. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1644.4s)]
*  And I've seen that with people. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1649.88s)]
*  It's interesting to watch it from the outside, watching like doorman [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1651.8s)]
*  and bartenders and people that just start out. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1656.96s)]
*  And then one of them starts doing well and then they start getting gigs [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1660.3600000000001s)]
*  and then they start opening for people and they see the fucking hate [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1663.76s)]
*  and the other people, man. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1666.56s)]
*  It's fascinating to watch that. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1667.84s)]
*  And so those are the ones who want to take you down. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1670.6s)]
*  The ones who want to take you down, the ones that can't do it. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1672.56s)]
*  Yeah, that's very interesting. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1674.8s)]
*  It it it. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1676.72s)]
*  You especially like working at the store [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1678.76s)]
*  because the big the big comics that come in and they'll just pick people [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1682.0s)]
*  and you would see it because people that's been at the store for a while, [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1686.24s)]
*  they wouldn't get picked to go on the road or open up. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1689.52s)]
*  But like people come in and be new. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1692.52s)]

*  But no, I know what you're talking about. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1743.3999999999999s)]
*  I feel that way, too. Yeah. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1745.12s)]
*  I feel that way. I feel that way. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1746.84s)]
*  I feel that way. I feel that way. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1748.9199999999998s)]
*  I feel that way. I feel that way. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1750.9199999999998s)]
*  I feel that way, too. Yeah. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1752.96s)]
*  It's like it's humbling. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1754.5600000000002s)]
*  And that's what I like about it. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1756.2s)]
*  Yeah, it makes me feel like I'm not good enough. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1757.92s)]
*  I just but it makes me get up and work. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1760.72s)]
*  Yes, that's what I'm talking about. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1763.04s)]
*  That's the good part about it. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1764.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Like if you if that's why I'm scared of things that make you overconfident. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1765.16s)]
*  Like things that make you overconfident, I think are terrible for you. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1769.52s)]
*  Yeah. I think you're probably better. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1772.0800000000002s)]
*  It depends on the person, clearly, because some people have a real problem with confidence [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1774.16s)]
*  and they don't have any. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1778.0800000000002s)]
*  And for them, marijuana could be debilitating. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1779.16s)]
*  I think for some people that are doing well, it's good. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1781.92s)]
*  It's a little reality check. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1785.48s)]
*  It's like you need to look at the big, giant picture. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1786.72s)]
*  And sometimes you don't. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1789.6000000000001s)]
*  You just get so locked in with blinders on looking at your own day to day existence [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1790.6000000000001s)]
*  and the only things that you concentrate on that you think are important. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1796.5200000000002s)]
*  Marijuana sort of dissolves any artificial barriers [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1799.96s)]
*  and just makes you look at things for what they really are. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1803.24s)]
*  I I I do allow myself to feel that once a month, [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1805.72s)]
*  but I have to be alone. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1810.8000000000002s)]
*  Well, that's probably good. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1812.68s)]
*  You know how to handle it. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1813.68s)]
*  That's smart. It's a good way to handle it. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1814.72s)]
*  That's right. I I get me some marijuana. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1816.44s)]
*  They be because you go to the stores now and they be like, oh, this is that [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1819.44s)]
*  little like Pollywop. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1823.2s)]
*  I'm just like, look, I don't give a shit. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1824.8000000000002s)]
*  Just give me just give me the shit. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1826.3200000000002s)]
*  I'm a smoke. Yeah. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1828.72s)]
*  This is your hybrid and you're [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1830.24s)]
*  mixed mixed with your hybrid. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1833.0400000000002s)]
*  So that's your endicure mixed with just the Tiva. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1835.5600000000002s)]
*  I'm like, man, I don't give a shit. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1838.44s)]
*  Just give me some just give me some weed. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1840.72s)]
*  I don't know nothing about weed like that. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1842.64s)]
*  So I want once a month, I'll smoke it. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1844.0s)]
*  I'll go through all my emotions. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1847.16s)]
*  I cry. I reset. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1848.8000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. I recharge. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1851.72s)]
*  Yeah. And it honestly looks like I'm in a crazy house. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1853.48s)]
*  I had to film myself one time. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1856.4s)]
*  It kind of looks like I'm wrapped up because I'm always I start rocking [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1857.96s)]
*  and I'm doing all of this and I'm crying and I'm talking to myself. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1861.1200000000001s)]
*  I'm like, you ain't shit. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1864.3600000000001s)]
*  And I'm like, bitch, please, please. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1865.0400000000002s)]
*  You got it. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1867.2s)]
*  Because my emotions are all over the place when I'm smoking. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1868.48s)]
*  So I'd rather just not do that in public. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1870.64s)]
*  That's a good call. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1873.44s)]
*  I feel like those things you're describing, though, as an artist, [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1874.92s)]
*  it's a normal thing. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1878.32s)]
*  It seems so crazy that, you know, you would battle with you ain't shit [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1880.1200000000001s)]
*  and you got this and that it's like both sides of your brain [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1884.16s)]
*  are sort of duking it out. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1887.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. But I think as an artist, that's something that does. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1888.8s)]
*  You have to have as a performer in particular, [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1891.76s)]
*  you have to have a certain amount of confidence. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1894.2s)]
*  You have to be able to go up there and know that you got it. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1895.96s)]
*  But also you have to have a certain amount of humility [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1898.3600000000001s)]
*  and you have to have a certain amount of perspective. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1901.4s)]
*  And sometimes it's hard. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1903.16s)]
*  And the better you get, the better you do in life, the more success you get. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1904.32s)]
*  I think it's harder to have that perspective [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1909.08s)]
*  because you know, it's easier to just believe your own bullshit. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1911.8400000000001s)]
*  It's easier to like pretend you're different than everybody else. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1914.8s)]
*  It's easier to do that, like that you're special. Yeah. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1917.4s)]
*  But marijuana, like, lets you know, like, right away, [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1920.32s)]
*  you bet you ain't special at all. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1922.4s)]
*  No, it's these voices. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1924.28s)]
*  You're full of fear and you're going to die. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1925.72s)]
*  Oh my. Yes. Yeah. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1927.44s)]
*  And you're vulnerable as fuck. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1929.44s)]
*  And so is everyone you love. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1930.84s)]
*  You know, we're all in this together. Yeah. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1932.72s)]
*  And it just it makes me like a more considerate person. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1934.68s)]
*  It makes me a kinder person. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1937.92s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. You always been considering the kind. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1940.8s)]
*  I ain't going to lie. You come to the store. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1942.96s)]
*  I remember they had some drama at the store one time. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1944.52s)]
*  And you was like, you was like, absolutely not. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1946.3999999999999s)]
*  No, no, no. I don't want to say what it was, but you had our back. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1948.3999999999999s)]
*  Like the servers, you protected us and you was like, fuck, no, not on my watch. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1952.76s)]
*  And we was like, yes, Joe, he loves us. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1957.28s)]
*  Well, sometimes people, they abuse people that like work in the service industry. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1962.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know, it happens a lot. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1966.72s)]
*  Unfortunately, you know, I try to pay it forward. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1969.72s)]
*  You know, you can always like when I go to restaurants and stuff, [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1972.68s)]
*  you can always tell that I served and I bought in there for a while [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1975.36s)]
*  because I stack everything up. Nice. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1977.92s)]
*  They like, well, you chill. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1980.52s)]
*  I'm like, it's habit. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1981.76s)]
*  I just clean the fucking table for the people. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1983.36s)]
*  They just come pick the shit up. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1985.64s)]
*  And then I tried my hardest to tip at least 50 percent. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1986.76s)]
*  Like, and I also get that from you. Yeah. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1991.6s)]
*  I'm like, you know, Joe, come in. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1994.8s)]
*  He made you show mad love. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1996.24s)]
*  You was the reason why we made money a lot a lot of nights. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=1997.48s)]
*  And so I just try to pay that back. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2000.32s)]
*  It feels good. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2003.36s)]
*  I tell people it's like you leave in love bombs, leaving a love bomb. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2004.28s)]
*  Like, even if you're not even there to watch it go off, [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2008.16s)]
*  I like to get out of the room before they even see the tip. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2009.96s)]
*  Yes. Just enjoy that. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2012.8400000000001s)]
*  I mean, I can't do it all the time. Yeah. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2014.6000000000001s)]
*  But sometimes I'm with my girl and I'm like, if this I mean, [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2016.32s)]
*  especially if the people were incredible, I look at my girl, [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2019.28s)]
*  I'm like, we blessing these people tonight. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2021.48s)]
*  She'd be like, bless me. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2022.8s)]
*  That's even better. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2026.8400000000001s)]
*  Even better if you say it that way. Yeah. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2028.1200000000001s)]
*  So and it feels, you know, because yeah, because like you said, [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2030.4s)]
*  I don't need to stay and see the reaction. Yeah. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2033.56s)]
*  I think that's missing in cultures where they don't tip. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2035.8s)]
*  Like, I think the problem with with tipping is that you could still pay [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2038.44s)]
*  someone like two bucks an hour, which is kind of crazy. Yeah. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2043.0s)]
*  Which is crazy. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2045.68s)]
*  Like two bucks an hour is so crazy, especially like if you not, [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2046.52s)]
*  if you don't have a job in New York, because I think you can do that in New York. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2050.52s)]
*  I think there's a lot of places you could do that. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2053.7200000000003s)]
*  Well, what I think is is like if you what I mean is if you do it in New York, [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2056.32s)]
*  I don't think it matters because people in New York, they just have this sense. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2060.56s)]
*  They just know the tips. Right. Right. Right. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2063.56s)]
*  They just know to show love. It's an East Coast thing. Yeah. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2065.36s)]
*  But you know, you know, a lot of people in the East Coast are tippers. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2067.7599999999998s)]
*  I like that about these. I love the East Coast. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2072.16s)]
*  I don't think I'm going back to the West Coast. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2073.7999999999997s)]
*  I think the problem with the West Coast is too many people trying to be famous. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2075.2s)]
*  And when you get too many people trying to be famous, [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2078.3999999999996s)]
*  you have like a high percentage of narcissists and a high percentage of sociopaths. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2081.04s)]
*  Not me. I don't know. I don't mean it's like all of them, [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2086.3999999999996s)]
*  but it's like, what's the average, the percentage of sociopaths? [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2088.7599999999998s)]
*  I think they say it's like 10 percent or something like that or 4 percent. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2091.8399999999997s)]
*  That's it. Yeah. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2094.96s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know how to know. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2096.12s)]
*  I feel like it's way more. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2097.44s)]
*  I don't know how they really know. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2098.44s)]
*  You know, they do it based on a sample size. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2099.7999999999997s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know if they really know the actual numbers. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2101.92s)]
*  But that's the estimate. Right. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2104.3199999999997s)]
*  And if you go to a place like Hollywood, you got to imagine that [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2107.04s)]
*  most of the people that go there, they the people that move there, [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2110.44s)]
*  they move there to either be a part of the business, [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2115.36s)]
*  like to be a producer or a director or something, [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2118.0s)]
*  or they want to be in front of the camera and or they want to be famous. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2121.24s)]
*  They don't even know how. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2125.68s)]
*  And they'll try to figure out a thing like you've seen people go. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2126.9199999999996s)]
*  They go from acting and then they're acting for a while. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2129.24s)]
*  And then they say, you know, I'm going to do stand up. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2131.7599999999998s)]
*  We've seen a lot of those. Right. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2133.12s)]
*  And then they just they don't really love stand up. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2134.72s)]
*  What they really love is getting attention. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2137.64s)]
*  They got broken when they were younger. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2140.96s)]
*  They have a hole inside of them that they need to constantly fill up [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2142.7599999999998s)]
*  with other people's attention. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2146.16s)]
*  And they'll pretend to be someone to get attention. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2147.2s)]
*  Yeah. Which is the fucked up thing about auditioning, [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2150.56s)]
*  because you take a person who's like super insecure, [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2153.84s)]
*  wants to come to Hollywood for validation. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2156.44s)]
*  And then you have this process where you have to beg people to like you. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2158.68s)]
*  You have to go in there and put on your best show, [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2163.8s)]
*  and hope these people like you, [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2166.96s)]
*  which completely changes the way people behave, [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2168.56s)]
*  because those people that are so desperate for success [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2171.48s)]
*  or really want to make it, they start behaving and thinking in a way [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2174.0s)]
*  that they think is going to get them successful in their business. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2178.36s)]
*  And they can't express unique or individual opinions on things. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2181.04s)]
*  They can't have controversial views. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2185.0s)]
*  You're not allowed to. You won't get a gig. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2186.52s)]
*  And so you have all these people that just they become like this sort of [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2189.04s)]
*  Hollywood ideology espousers. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2194.56s)]
*  They just become these people that talk the same way. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2198.1600000000003s)]
*  Like you see them, they say like when they see you, [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2201.6800000000003s)]
*  they don't say nice to meet you, punky. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2204.08s)]
*  They say good to see you. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2206.2400000000002s)]
*  Good to see you, because maybe they've seen you already. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2207.6400000000003s)]
*  Maybe they forgot. Right. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2210.0s)]
*  So instead of like just saying nice to meet you or we met. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2211.7200000000003s)]
*  Oh, I'm sorry. When do we meet? [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2214.64s)]
*  Instead of having a real moment. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2215.8s)]
*  It's good to see you. Everything is good to see you. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2217.44s)]
*  It's fucking weird. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2219.48s)]
*  Because they're like little robots. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2221.2400000000002s)]
*  Like who the fuck says good to see you? [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2223.68s)]
*  It's like you brought a friend over and the friend says, hi, this is my friend, punky. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2225.04s)]
*  Hi, punky. Good to see you. Good to see you. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2228.56s)]
*  Like what kind of weird people you're bringing over here. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2231.08s)]
*  Yeah. What the fuck is going on? Good to see me. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2233.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's good to see. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2235.52s)]
*  It's good to hear you, too. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2237.2400000000002s)]
*  It's so crazy. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2239.2s)]
*  I never thought about that. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2240.68s)]
*  Yeah. So that flavors the vibe of the city [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2242.2799999999997s)]
*  because it's the number one industry, or at least the most famous industry [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2246.68s)]
*  in Los Angeles is the television and film industry. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2251.3199999999997s)]
*  And then, of course, the music business, which is kind of similar. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2255.56s)]
*  I mean, when the record days in the record days and the radio days, [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2258.7999999999997s)]
*  when it was really important, you had to impress these people [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2261.84s)]
*  that were the record executives and you had to impress these people [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2266.12s)]
*  who were the radio executives because they would play your music [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2268.6s)]
*  and they would pick you. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2271.6s)]
*  And there were so many people they could pick and they would pick you. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2272.7999999999997s)]
*  And they had these predatory relationships where they take an enormous amount [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2275.48s)]
*  of money that you made. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2279.0s)]
*  And that was the only way you're going to make it. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2280.4s)]
*  How else are you going to make it? You got to go through the system. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2282.52s)]
*  Yeah. And a lot of people who made it through like Prince [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2284.56s)]
*  to change his fucking name because he couldn't perform [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2287.7999999999997s)]
*  under the name Prince. That's that crazy logo. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2290.64s)]
*  That's crazy. It's crazy that he pulled it off, though. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2293.2s)]
*  He's like, I got an idea, bitch. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2295.92s)]
*  I'm so famous. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2297.72s)]
*  Everybody knows who the fuck this is. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2298.7999999999997s)]
*  I was like, I'm me. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2300.3199999999997s)]
*  And he did it before social media. Yeah. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2301.92s)]
*  You know, like Kanye could change his name every week and people keep up. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2304.3199999999997s)]
*  Kanye can do whatever he wants. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2307.52s)]
*  He can change his name every week. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2308.72s)]
*  Kanye done did some shit. Kanye still popping. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2309.96s)]
*  They got some people that's just they took a big chunk out of his income. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2312.4s)]
*  Like what what is happening? [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2316.64s)]
*  It's it. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2318.44s)]
*  Kanye done said some shit and done some shit. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2321.12s)]
*  I mean, some shit that done pissed me off. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2323.68s)]
*  But he's not going to go away. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2326.24s)]
*  He's too talented. You know, he's he's just not. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2327.9599999999996s)]
*  He's also I don't think he's a bad person. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2332.0s)]
*  I think I think Kanye, the mistakes he's made. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2333.6s)]
*  I think he'll be pretty honest about it. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2336.48s)]
*  He's mentally ill. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2338.0s)]
*  And that mental illness allows him to have insane productivity with music. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2339.08s)]
*  But you can call it illness. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2343.8799999999997s)]
*  Or you could instead say he's got this gift [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2345.52s)]
*  and this gift sometimes fucking shoots off live rounds [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2348.56s)]
*  and all sorts of different directions. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2351.7599999999998s)]
*  But what it can do is produce some of the best fucking music ever. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2353.24s)]
*  Fucking amazing jams where you listen to them and you like over and you forget [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2357.04s)]
*  sometimes I'm going to play one. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2361.64s)]
*  You know, oh, shit, I forgot about this one. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2362.7999999999997s)]
*  Kanye had some bangers like that mind that creates those bangers. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2365.6s)]
*  Also says crazy shit about Hitler. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2370.08s)]
*  I guess. And then what are you doing? [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2373.04s)]
*  Why would you say that? [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2375.9199999999996s)]
*  And I think also, if you when he gets embattled, [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2376.7999999999997s)]
*  the problem is he wants to fight back. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2381.32s)]
*  Like, I think part of the reason why he became a big Trump fan [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2383.0s)]
*  is because Obama called him a jackass. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2386.56s)]
*  I really believe that. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2389.56s)]
*  Yes, I really believe that. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2391.48s)]
*  Because you've got to imagine having the president of the United States [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2393.4s)]
*  refer to you as a jackass and the first black president United States. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2396.36s)]
*  One of like in my life, other than Kennedy, who's a better spokesman? [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2400.52s)]
*  Who's a better statesman than Obama? [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2405.84s)]
*  Who's like the most impressive of all presidents? [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2407.84s)]
*  Well, you would look to a guy and say that the way that guy thinks and talks, [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2410.3999999999996s)]
*  that's a leader, that's a real president of the United States. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2414.7599999999998s)]
*  And that guy called him a jackass. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2417.4399999999996s)]
*  So I think that shit stuck in his head. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2420.16s)]
*  Kanye petty. I was like, fuck yeah, he's petty. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2422.52s)]
*  I mean, you can tell he's petty. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2425.7599999999998s)]
*  You see the shit that he writes about Pete Davidson? [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2427.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's ruthless. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2430.16s)]
*  That was his petty. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2431.3599999999997s)]
*  But he's that's also the same mind. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2432.3999999999996s)]
*  That's the same mind that makes him be insanely prolific. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2434.7999999999997s)]
*  That's the same mind that has like this genius association to sound and music. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2437.92s)]
*  It's the same mind. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2441.6400000000003s)]
*  I'm just glad he didn't simmer down. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2442.84s)]
*  Yeah. Well, he doesn't have a place to speak to. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2444.96s)]
*  He doesn't have a place to blow it off anymore, you know, [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2448.28s)]
*  which I also think is not good. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2450.36s)]
*  I think it's probably better to just let him say [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2451.88s)]
*  ridiculous shit on Twitter and let people refute it. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2455.32s)]
*  You know, I don't think it's a good me. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2458.0800000000004s)]
*  You know, I don't think it's a good move to eliminate a guy like that [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2460.48s)]
*  from being able to communicate. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2463.92s)]
*  I don't think that's the problem. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2465.2000000000003s)]
*  And I don't think he should be medicated either, which is even crazier, [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2467.0s)]
*  because like when he was medicated, remember, he was all slow and he got chubby. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2469.52s)]
*  You remember? [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2473.28s)]
*  I didn't know that he was on medication. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2474.6s)]
*  They put him on some heavy shit. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2476.32s)]
*  Well, you know what? [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2477.84s)]
*  I can assume slowed him down that people like him have to be, [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2478.64s)]
*  you know, medicated. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2483.2s)]
*  I just I just feel like billionaires sometimes they have nothing else to do. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2484.2400000000002s)]
*  But get medicated. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2488.28s)]
*  Yeah, it's like because it's like you've done everything. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2489.48s)]
*  You've seen everything. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2492.36s)]
*  You've won all the awards. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2493.4s)]
*  You married with the world consider is the baddest bitch you you you have you. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2494.96s)]
*  It's like what else is there for you to fucking do? [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2501.52s)]
*  Yeah, but that doesn't mean you have to get medicated. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2504.32s)]
*  Like, you know what I'm saying? [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2506.4s)]
*  But that's what I'm saying. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2507.28s)]
*  As an artist, he probably got medicated because he had nothing else to do. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2508.28s)]
*  So he started doing shit that he probably wasn't supposed to do. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2510.6s)]
*  They like, all right, let's come here. Pop this. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2513.4s)]
*  Well, I think, you know, people around him were concerned because he gets manic. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2515.56s)]
*  But that's that manic, crazy energy is also what comes out in his music. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2519.68s)]
*  I mean, talking to him is wild because when you have a conversation with him, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2525.68s)]
*  like when I did a podcast with him, it's like you could see you can see in some people [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2529.6s)]
*  where their mind is like a runaway train. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2534.52s)]
*  It's like a runaway train and ideas are coming in way faster than they're coming into my mind. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2538.44s)]
*  They're coming in and going and he'll go from one idea to the next idea. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2543.48s)]
*  And people say, yeah, he's rambling. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2547.2s)]
*  But I'm like, but but is he or is he just sort of like [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2549.4s)]
*  he's being infused with way more ideas than we are. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2553.3199999999997s)]
*  Like they're coming like Elon's the same way. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2557.16s)]
*  When you talk to Elon, when I was talking to him, I was like, [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2559.08s)]
*  what is going on behind those eyes? [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2561.68s)]
*  Like how many different thought processes do you have running simultaneously? [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2563.72s)]
*  Right. Like that guy never wants to stop. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2567.8799999999997s)]
*  He's like always he's always got new ideas and thinking. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2569.56s)]
*  He's always like innovating, creating. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2572.68s)]
*  It's a different kind of way of thinking. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2575.3199999999997s)]
*  And I don't think you get it. And I don't think I get it. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2577.16s)]
*  I damn sure don't get it. I don't get it. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2579.6s)]
*  I don't get it. I just I just rather Kanye keep all his shit in his music. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2581.12s)]
*  He got to stop saying some wild ass shit. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2585.4s)]
*  Sometimes he says wild shit. That's really interesting. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2587.2799999999997s)]
*  Like on my podcast, he goes, how much is the earth? [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2589.44s)]
*  Like if I wanted to buy the earth, how much does the earth cost? [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2592.4s)]
*  That's all land costs money. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2594.68s)]
*  Yeah. He's like, if land costs money, could someone have enough money [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2596.52s)]
*  they could buy the whole earth? I was like, oh, shit. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2599.84s)]
*  Yeah. Like that sounds ridiculous. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2602.24s)]
*  But if someone like Jeff Bezos has like two hundred billion dollars, [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2604.2799999999997s)]
*  like that's so much fucking money. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2609.68s)]
*  Like what's to stop someone from having two hundred trillion? [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2611.2799999999997s)]
*  And how much is the earth? How much is the whole earth? [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2614.04s)]
*  What is it? And what if the whole earth is only a hundred trillion? [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2617.16s)]
*  You can own it all. But also, everybody has to pay your rent. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2621.0s)]
*  Also, if the earth for sale, who's selling that? [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2623.3599999999997s)]
*  Who's buying it? Who's buying it? [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2626.2s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2628.7599999999998s)]
*  Someone would have to make every single person an impossible offer. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2629.96s)]
*  They'd have to make every single person an offer that you could not refuse. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2634.12s)]
*  That's so much money that every single person on the planet has to say yes. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2637.32s)]
*  I would think that that'll be a good investment on an earth. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2640.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I think the only way someone's going to own the earth is stealing it. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2644.88s)]
*  That is going to force eminent domain, force people out of area. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2647.92s)]
*  That's how people own the earth. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2650.6000000000004s)]
*  I don't think they're ever going to own the earth by buying it. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2652.0800000000004s)]
*  But but Kanye having that idea, like how much does the earth cost? [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2653.76s)]
*  Like, how the fuck's I've never thought of that? [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2657.0800000000004s)]
*  So that's what I hope he keep his wild ideas and thoughts there. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2659.0s)]
*  It's talking about human beings. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2662.8s)]
*  Sometimes dudes like that need somebody to bounce shit off of, too. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2665.52s)]
*  They need like a more reasonable, crazy person. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2668.4s)]
*  That's with them that can go slow down. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2671.0s)]
*  Yeah, I hear you, but slow down. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2672.96s)]
*  You know, with Elon Musk, I know people have their thoughts about him, [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2675.1200000000003s)]
*  but I had a very great personal conversation with him. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2679.84s)]
*  And I think people forget that these people that have all this money [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2683.84s)]
*  and these people that are so smart, these people that are on TV, [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2687.76s)]
*  they're human beings and they have real lives. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2690.4s)]
*  And me and Elon talked about his family and his children. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2692.96s)]
*  And that's when I was like, OK, this is a real person. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2697.4s)]
*  This guy has a heart. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2699.36s)]
*  And I think he's actually a good a good guy. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2700.16s)]
*  If you sit down and you have an actual conversation with him, [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2702.56s)]
*  just like off the record. I love him. I love talking to him. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2704.76s)]
*  He's a wonderful person. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2708.08s)]
*  He's just super genius, just a ridiculously smart person. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2709.56s)]
*  But he's a human being like we all are. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2712.84s)]
*  We're all human beings. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2715.16s)]
*  And you can forget that when you see some dude is making rockets [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2716.12s)]
*  and making electric cars and satellites and fucking. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2718.6s)]
*  Trying to fix traffic. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2722.48s)]
*  Yeah, you forget that's just a human being. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2724.28s)]
*  I also thought he was going to leave everybody at SNL Tesla [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2726.6s)]
*  because the host they leave us gifts, slippers, shoes, hoodies. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2731.2s)]
*  Sometimes we'll come to work the next after that Saturday. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2735.0s)]
*  They they we have a whole bunch of catered food. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2737.44s)]
*  Oh, this food from Jack Harlow, this food from such and such. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2739.88s)]
*  So I was like, you know what? [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2743.36s)]
*  What if Elon leave us all Tesla's? [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2744.84s)]
*  I was wrong. That's so many Tesla's. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2748.0s)]
*  How many Tesla's would that be for how many people? [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2750.64s)]
*  I think it would have been at the time when he came. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2752.68s)]
*  I think it would have been 22 Tesla's. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2754.56s)]
*  She's like, they probably have a back order on those things anyway. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2756.48s)]
*  Cars are I don't know if they've sorted that out yet with new cars. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2761.56s)]
*  But with new cars, there was a backlog on new cars because of chips. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2764.8799999999997s)]
*  There's like a problem getting the chips, the computer chips, [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2769.0s)]
*  which are in every fucking car now. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2772.2799999999997s)]
*  Ah, is the computer chips the like the [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2773.96s)]
*  so you can know where the car is? [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2778.6s)]
*  No. So the computer works with the emission system and everything is computerized now. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2780.2s)]
*  Oh, OK. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2784.72s)]
*  And then also there's an operating system that runs like Apple CarPlay. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2785.48s)]
*  Oh, OK. CarPlay. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2789.16s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know shit about cars. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2790.64s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I'm a car nut. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2792.3599999999997s)]
*  Oh, cool. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2794.64s)]
*  But the new ones are confusing to me. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2795.64s)]
*  Look, I get that all that stuff is important, [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2797.8799999999997s)]
*  but it's confusing that we don't even make a lot of that shit over here. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2800.56s)]
*  Like, you know, a lot of the chips, they're making them overseas. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2805.04s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2807.7999999999997s)]
*  So I think they're having I think Elon's working on making chips here [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2808.84s)]
*  and Samsung is working on making chips here. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2812.8s)]
*  But I think a lot of that was exposed during the pandemic, [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2814.5600000000004s)]
*  that a lot of chips are being made overseas and they need them for cars. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2816.6000000000004s)]
*  So there's a big delay for a lot of different manufacturers. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2820.2000000000003s)]
*  So probably a lot of them are looking at trying to figure out a way. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2823.5600000000004s)]
*  But I had a Sager and Crystal from Breaking Points on the other day. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2826.7200000000003s)]
*  And Sager was explaining it in depth. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2831.84s)]
*  And he was saying that that shit takes like 10 years. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2834.2000000000003s)]
*  Like when you when you want to start a factory and start building [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2836.84s)]
*  computer chips in America, that's like 10 years from now you can. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2839.84s)]
*  God damn. It takes forever. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2843.52s)]
*  Yeah, that's why I say technology confuses me. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2845.0s)]
*  Politics confuses me. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2848.48s)]
*  Those two things I like to just do good. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2850.2400000000002s)]
*  Like when I go by a car. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2852.36s)]
*  Yeah, it's so simple and fast with me. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2854.36s)]
*  I go in a lot. I be like, I want them. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2856.32s)]
*  They say, OK, if I be in and I be out, they give me a price. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2858.84s)]
*  If I like it, I like it. If I don't, I don't. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2863.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm like, no, but we can't go down the more I bet. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2865.2s)]
*  I'm going down the road then. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2867.72s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2868.9199999999996s)]
*  Well, what's up? [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2871.3199999999997s)]
*  I say this is what I want. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2872.3599999999997s)]
*  This is how much I want to pay for it. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2873.24s)]
*  And I don't want to get in that room. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2874.48s)]
*  And then you offer me all kind of other shit. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2875.52s)]
*  I want the tires included. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2877.16s)]
*  I want the oil included. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=2878.3599999999997s)]

*  But the point is like those cars, that's a similar sort of thing. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=3144.6s)]

*  I was just thinking how ridiculous it was that Clint Eastwood had a movie where the star [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=3684.3199999999997s)]
*  of the movie was that he had the biggest gun. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=3688.76s)]
*  He had a .44 Magnum. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=3691.28s)]
*  Remember? [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=3693.28s)]
*  Did you ever watch Dirty Harry? [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=3694.28s)]
*  No. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=3695.5200000000004s)]
*  That was the whole premise of the movie. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=3696.5200000000004s)]
*  Like everybody else had a .38. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=3697.76s)]
*  He's got a .44. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=3699.4s)]
*  He might think, did I shoot all those bullets or did I not? [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=3700.4s)]
*  Do you feel lucky punk? [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=3704.76s)]
*  I might have to write that one down. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=3705.76s)]
*  I got to watch that one. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=3708.2000000000003s)]
*  It's a corny ass movie. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=3709.44s)]
*  And it's a movie that if you watch it now it's so dated. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=3710.96s)]
*  So go to the scene where Clint Eastwood says, do you feel lucky from Dirty Harry? [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=3714.7599999999998s)]
*  Where the guy is like a cartoonish bad guy. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=3719.4s)]
*  Like the most evil cartoonish bad guy. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=3723.48s)]
*  And Clint Eastwood gives him this, do you feel lucky? [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=3725.96s)]
*  Well do you punk? [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=3728.64s)]
*  And then he fucking, of course he shoots him. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=3729.64s)]
*  This is the classic scene. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=3735.64s)]
*  Whatcha thinking? [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=3744.64s)]
*  Did he fire six shots or only five? [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=3745.64s)]
*  Well to tell you the truth in all this excitement I've kinda lost track myself. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=3748.64s)]
*  But Ian this is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=3753.64s)]
*  And would blow your head clean off. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=3757.64s)]
*  You've got to ask yourself one question. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=3759.64s)]
*  Do I feel lucky? [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=3761.64s)]
*  Well do you punk? [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=3763.64s)]

*  No shot. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=3793.64s)]
*  He wanted to know whether or not he had the bullets? [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=3794.64s)]
*  Uh oh. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=3797.64s)]

*  I remember this entirely wrong. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=3810.64s)]

*  They were great. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4040.64s)]
*  They were fun. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4042.64s)]
*  He looked like a bad motherfucker. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4044.64s)]
*  I believe that. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4046.64s)]
*  I think it was one of the most realistic martial arts action films ever. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4048.64s)]
*  He wasn't doing jump split kicks. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4050.64s)]
*  He was bashing people over the head with pool sticks. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4052.64s)]
*  And fucking breaking their arms and shit. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4054.64s)]
*  It was more realistic. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4056.64s)]
*  I can fuck with the martial arts. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4058.64s)]
*  I love it. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4060.64s)]
*  I want to get into some... [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4062.64s)]
*  Wing Chun. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4064.64s)]
*  I want to get into some Wing Chun. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4066.64s)]
*  Because I love Ip Man. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4068.64s)]
*  I've been watching a lot of that. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4070.64s)]
*  You want to learn it? [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4072.64s)]
*  I do. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4074.64s)]
*  I've been boxing going on for two years now. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4076.64s)]
*  I'm getting fast. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4078.64s)]
*  I'm getting good. I'm getting fast. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4080.64s)]
*  But I like the smoothness of Wing Chun. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4082.64s)]
*  Right. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4084.64s)]
*  I do like the box. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4086.64s)]
*  Boxing to me, a lot of people try to rush it. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4088.64s)]
*  But it's all in your feet. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4090.64s)]
*  Everybody try to create power when the power is in your legs. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4092.64s)]
*  I had to learn all of that as well. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4094.64s)]
*  And boxing ain't as easy as it looks. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4096.639999999999s)]
*  Boxing does not look easy. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4098.639999999999s)]
*  I watch boxing and I'm like, I can do that. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4100.639999999999s)]
*  Really? [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4102.639999999999s)]
*  I used to. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4104.639999999999s)]
*  And then I get in there and I find out I'm goofy. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4106.64s)]
*  My feet don't do what my feet supposed to do. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4108.64s)]
*  My feet don't do what my feet supposed to do. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4110.64s)]
*  You know. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4112.64s)]
*  It's a rhythm. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4114.64s)]
*  I had to learn all of that. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4116.64s)]
*  I had to get my feet together before I swung a punch. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4118.64s)]
*  I had to get my feet together before I swung a punch. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4120.64s)]
*  I think that's the importance. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4122.64s)]
*  I want to learn some Wing Chung. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4124.64s)]
*  Wing Chung, it's interesting [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4126.64s)]
*  for blocking and stuff, [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4128.64s)]
*  and trapping arms. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4130.64s)]
*  There are a few moves that some guys do in MMA fights. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4132.64s)]
*  in MMA fights where it is really technically wing chung [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4134.64s)]
*  because they're like block things and trap things [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4137.88s)]
*  and then land shots over the top. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4139.58s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4140.780000000001s)]
*  But if you're learning boxing, [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4141.9800000000005s)]
*  that's like the best thing you can learn [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4143.18s)]
*  in terms of like realistic self-defense with your hands. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4145.46s)]
*  Like yeah, boxing is probably the best thing to learn. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4148.02s)]
*  I wanted to do, I wanted to fight when I was younger. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4150.700000000001s)]
*  My mother never let me fight. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4154.860000000001s)]
*  She never, the reason why I'm boxing now [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4156.06s)]
*  is because she never let me. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4157.54s)]
*  I wanted to box. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4159.0s)]
*  I remember I was in the sixth grade [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4159.84s)]
*  and I had a friend named, I think his name was Carl. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4160.9400000000005s)]
*  And he was a fighter. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4164.78s)]
*  He was a fighter in the sixth grade. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4165.7s)]
*  And I was like, mom, I wanna fight. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4169.58s)]
*  She's like, no. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4172.379999999999s)]
*  But I'm happy she said no [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4173.78s)]
*  because I remember me and Tony Hinchcliffe [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4175.219999999999s)]
*  was watching a fight. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4177.0199999999995s)]

*  I think it was right before COVID actually. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4180.12s)]
*  And I forgot her name, Joanna, I think. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4182.32s)]
*  Joanna Young Jcheck. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4184.7s)]
*  Yeah, the UFC fighter. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4185.96s)]
*  With the giant hole, the swollen head. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4187.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4190.66s)]
*  Man, when I saw that, I think I called my mom [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4191.799999999999s)]
*  and I was like, you was right. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4194.76s)]
*  You was right as I was growing up to not let me fight. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4195.860000000001s)]
*  That looked crucial. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4197.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that one was pretty rare though. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4199.240000000001s)]
*  That usually does not happen. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4201.4400000000005s)]
*  That's happened once in a boxing match. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4203.4400000000005s)]
*  Really? [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4205.54s)]
*  Haseem Rahman. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4206.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4207.200000000001s)]

*  He did that to somebody? [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4211.18s)]
*  No, no, no, his head. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4212.52s)]
*  Go to Haseem Rahman. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4213.64s)]
*  Hematoma. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4217.02s)]
*  Yeah, look at that. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4217.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4220.4800000000005s)]
*  What fight was that in? [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4221.320000000001s)]
*  Who was he fighting? [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4222.160000000001s)]
*  Where'd that happen? [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4223.0s)]
*  Holyfield, that's right. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4224.719999999999s)]
*  Really? [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4226.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, something happened. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4227.5199999999995s)]
*  And sometimes it happens off a headbutt. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4228.88s)]
*  Like sometimes dudes accidentally collide heads [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4231.08s)]
*  and then your tissue rips [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4234.46s)]
*  and then the inside of your head fills up with blood. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4237.0599999999995s)]
*  No. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4239.36s)]
*  Oh. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4240.2s)]
*  So it was a punch that did it. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4241.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4242.5s)]
*  So it looks like it might've been like a little swollen [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4243.84s)]
*  already and then he lands like a perfect punch. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4245.7s)]
*  If I remember this fight, it was like a crazy brawl. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4248.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, see, like it looked like it was already [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4251.04s)]
*  a little swollen. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4252.700000000001s)]
*  Like maybe they had collided heads [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4253.740000000001s)]
*  or maybe another punch had done it. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4255.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4257.88s)]

*  So you open up a coffee shop that's full of strippers [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4816.64s)]
*  and you call it tease search or some shit. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4822.88s)]
*  Like just something stupid. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4825.360000000001s)]
*  It could be a real idea, it could be something fake. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4827.04s)]
*  I always pitch something stupid. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4830.76s)]
*  Like I remember we went to work on Black History Day, [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4833.259999999999s)]
*  on Martin Luther King Day. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4837.0199999999995s)]
*  And my pitch was, hey Aubrey, [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4839.38s)]
*  you are the captain of the Holiday Police Department [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4841.82s)]
*  and you come and find Lauren Michaels [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4846.58s)]
*  for having all the black people at work [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4848.78s)]
*  on Martin Luther King Day. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4850.299999999999s)]
*  The office was busting out laughing. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4851.679999999999s)]
*  Cause I go in there, I say what everybody wanna say. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4853.7s)]
*  Cause I don't give a fuck, you know what I'm saying? [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4857.42s)]
*  I just be having fun. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4859.179999999999s)]
*  And then after that you leave the pitch [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4860.8s)]
*  and you go, you can either stay and talk, talk in groups [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4863.28s)]
*  and figure out what you're gonna do for Tuesday [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4867.639999999999s)]
*  or you leave. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4869.36s)]
*  I leave or I stay, blah, blah, blah. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4870.2s)]
*  And then Tuesday you write all day. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4872.16s)]
*  We get to the office two, three o'clock. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4874.4s)]
*  We don't leave till two, three o'clock. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4876.44s)]
*  And then Wednesdays you gotta wake up at eight, [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4879.24s)]
*  go over your sketches with your writers, fix it. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4881.639999999999s)]
*  Maybe you'll go back to sleep about 10, 30, 11, [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4884.9s)]
*  sleep for 30 minutes, get back up, [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4887.5199999999995s)]
*  and go to work until 11 p.m., 12 p.m. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4889.42s)]
*  If your sketch get picked, you know, [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4892.86s)]
*  cause you gotta produce it. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4894.92s)]
*  So also at this job I'm learning how to produce, [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4896.46s)]
*  learning how to direct, learning how to make fast edits, [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4899.58s)]
*  because you gotta pick your set, [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4904.74s)]
*  you gotta pick the clothes that people are gonna wear, [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4906.66s)]
*  you gotta pick the outfits, you gotta pick the wigs, [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4908.46s)]
*  you gotta, if you write the sketch and it get picked, [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4911.0599999999995s)]
*  you gotta do it all. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4913.96s)]
*  Of course you have help, but you're learning the stuff. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4915.56s)]
*  Did you do any of that before you went to SNL? [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4919.64s)]
*  No. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4922.44s)]
*  No theater, no nothing? [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4923.28s)]
*  I went to an actor school called the Actors' Boot Camp, [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4924.6s)]
*  but that was that. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4926.76s)]
*  That's neither here nor there. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4931.24s)]
*  Yeah, well I think acting class is probably in some ways [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4932.6s)]
*  a little bit like comedy class. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4936.04s)]
*  I think there's good ones, in terms of acting class, [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4939.72s)]
*  where it's legitimate, like real good places [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4942.92s)]
*  where people learn, they really do. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4945.16s)]
*  And then there's also like acting lessons [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4946.5599999999995s)]
*  that are given by people that weren't really good actors. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4948.599999999999s)]
*  They didn't really make it as an actor, [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4951.32s)]
*  and they're teaching it. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4952.84s)]
*  I know a lot of people that'll teach you something [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4954.08s)]
*  because they've done it, and they. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4956.5599999999995s)]
*  That's the problem with comedy, right? [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4958.08s)]
*  Like the comedy classes, [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4960.08s)]
*  they're not being taught by Dave Chappelle. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4961.32s)]
*  They're being taught by someone [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4963.599999999999s)]
*  who's probably not that good at comedy, [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4964.88s)]
*  which is why they're teaching classes. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4967.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4969.2s)]
*  There's a lot of that. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4970.24s)]
*  It does get you on stage though. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4971.080000000001s)]
*  That's the benefit of it. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4973.200000000001s)]
*  When I did get to SNL, a lot of people did go to school. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4976.8s)]
*  They did, they went to acting school? [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4979.88s)]
*  They went to like improv school, Second City, [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4981.4800000000005s)]
*  Ground Links and all of that. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4984.68s)]
*  Because the more and more I get to know people over there, [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4986.52s)]
*  I'm like, oh y'all went to school? [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4988.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4990.6s)]
*  Oh, I came from a little place with black walls [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4991.4400000000005s)]
*  called the Comedy Store. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4994.34s)]
*  I don't know nothing about this. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4995.400000000001s)]
*  It's a type of school though. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4997.0s)]
*  You know? [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=4998.96s)]
*  It's a performance school for sure. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5000.02s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5001.3s)]
*  So I'm just, and with that, [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5002.5s)]
*  that's me saying to myself, what are you doing? [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5004.66s)]
*  Well, think about how young Eddie Murphy was [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5008.18s)]
*  when he was on SNL [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5010.64s)]
*  and all his performance was stand up. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5012.34s)]
*  But look how good he was. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5015.02s)]
*  Because he already knew how to perform. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5016.68s)]
*  The hardest thing is you're performing live for laughs [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5018.18s)]
*  in front of strangers all the time. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5021.58s)]
*  And in your case, you're getting up late. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5023.18s)]
*  You were getting up late [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5025.34s)]
*  and you were going on after a bunch of murderers, [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5026.5s)]
*  Anthony Jesselneck and Sebastian and all these killers. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5028.88s)]
*  And so by the time you're on stage, [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5032.16s)]
*  that show's three hours old. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5033.8s)]
*  It was fun. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5037.08s)]
*  It's fun. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5039.5599999999995s)]
*  I think like Don Barrett, he loved that late night spot. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5040.68s)]
*  Whoever is in there, he lights it up. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5044.76s)]
*  Like, yeah, I've been in here for three hours. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5047.5199999999995s)]
*  Then you meet this person, [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5049.5199999999995s)]
*  this crazy psychotic human being [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5051.36s)]
*  who comes in the Comedy Store, who's a staple. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5053.48s)]
*  And he's like, get up here and come spit in my mouth. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5058.02s)]
*  It's like, wait a minute, what? [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5060.5s)]
*  And then he got the band coming up [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5062.34s)]
*  and people, it's not a real band. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5064.26s)]
*  He pressed play on this thing [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5066.5s)]
*  and everybody's beating on chairs [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5067.86s)]
*  and they got fake pianos. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5070.1s)]
*  And it is, you are rocking, [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5074.06s)]
*  he's rocking the house at two, three in the morning [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5077.54s)]
*  until they say, all right, that's enough. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5080.82s)]
*  He'll go till four if you let him. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5082.46s)]
*  And it's just lit. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5084.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5086.08s)]
*  So that's the beauty of that place. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5086.919999999999s)]
*  That late night spot, that was the Kinnison spot. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5090.48s)]
*  That's how Kinnison became famous. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5092.839999999999s)]
*  Kinnison became famous because people would, [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5094.879999999999s)]
*  well, first of all, cause he was so talented, [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5097.099999999999s)]
*  and he did Letterman and HBO, [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5099.08s)]
*  but the thing in Hollywood was that people would know [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5101.2s)]
*  that Kinnison was going on after midnight. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5104.0s)]
*  And so they would come to the store to see Kinnison [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5106.0s)]
*  cause he was on last. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5108.5599999999995s)]
*  And he would go as long as he wants. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5110.12s)]
*  The last person goes as long as they want. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5112.36s)]
*  And so that's the Holtzman spot too now. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5114.38s)]
*  And Kinnison would go up and you'd have all these rock stars [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5116.84s)]
*  and movie stars go by and see him. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5120.24s)]
*  That's dope. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5122.32s)]
*  And they came there just to see Kinnison. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5123.16s)]
*  That's so inspiring actually. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5125.24s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5127.12s)]
*  That's all I could think of when I first moved there. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5128.8s)]
*  And when I moved there, it was right after the wave [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5131.12s)]
*  cause comedy comes in these like wild waves sometimes [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5133.4400000000005s)]
*  and the store certainly always did. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5136.0s)]
*  And I got there in 94, [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5138.28s)]
*  I went there for the first time in 93 [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5140.12s)]
*  and it was like a ghost town. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5141.72s)]
*  It was crazy. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5143.26s)]
*  Like I went in the OR and there was like a boat act on stage. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5144.179999999999s)]
*  Like someone who just should have stopped a long time ago. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5147.94s)]
*  They were doing jokes from the 1970s. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5150.7s)]
*  It was sad. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5154.98s)]
*  And I was like, this is the comedy store? [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5156.54s)]
*  Like there's no one in there. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5158.66s)]
*  There was like 20 people in the audience [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5160.58s)]
*  and I sat in the back. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5162.139999999999s)]
*  But that was after Kinnison. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5164.0199999999995s)]
*  Like there was a Kinnison wave. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5165.42s)]
*  And it ended like in the late 80s when he left. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5166.9s)]
*  He left the comedy store and he got banned [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5170.7s)]
*  from the comedy store and then he kind of fell apart [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5172.320000000001s)]
*  and then he died. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5174.4400000000005s)]
*  And then when I got there in 93, 94, [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5175.6s)]
*  there wasn't like a lot of people that were like big names [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5178.92s)]
*  that were there all the time. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5181.96s)]
*  Yeah, I heard when I got there, they had like this, [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5183.4400000000005s)]
*  I think they called it like the dark ages or something. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5185.96s)]
*  Like where it was just like super dark [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5188.08s)]
*  and it wasn't too busy. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5190.6s)]
*  No, it wasn't busy at all for a while in the early 90s. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5192.92s)]
*  But occasionally like Martin Lawrence would come [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5196.320000000001s)]
*  and then it would be flooded. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5198.68s)]
*  But occasionally someone big would come [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5200.06s)]
*  and they would go in the main room [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5202.5s)]
*  and it would be monstrous. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5203.98s)]
*  And then the place would be packed. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5205.46s)]
*  George Carlin was there for a while. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5207.22s)]
*  You know, Damon Wayans would just stop in. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5209.18s)]
*  He would never like do like announce sets. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5211.42s)]
*  He would stop in and just, [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5213.98s)]
*  cause he just wanted to fuck around. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5215.18s)]
*  He wanted to go there and fuck around. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5216.7s)]
*  So you know, you'd see elite comedy, [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5218.34s)]
*  but it wasn't like it was in the 80s. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5220.68s)]
*  There was something, and then it became that again. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5223.22s)]
*  Like slowly over time it built up [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5225.56s)]
*  and then there was that new era that was in like the 2000s, [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5227.96s)]
*  like 2014 on that was like, fuck, [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5231.36s)]
*  every night was sold out. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5233.96s)]
*  Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5235.74s)]
*  Sunday, two shows, three shows. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5237.96s)]
*  Constantly packed house and moving in and out. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5239.68s)]
*  And you would see Chris Rock and Dave Chappelle [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5242.4s)]
*  and Louis CK and fucking Tim Dillon. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5244.36s)]
*  Holy shit, there's so many comics here. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5246.96s)]
*  It was wild. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5249.24s)]
*  But yeah, my first night actually working, [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5250.08s)]
*  I wasn't supposed to work, [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5252.64s)]
*  I was actually there for orientation. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5253.48s)]
*  And it was so stacked. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5255.5s)]
*  There was like, yo, [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5258.5s)]
*  you mind just kind of expediting a little bit. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5259.339999999999s)]
*  I'm like, how? [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5261.54s)]
*  I don't know where the table's at. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5262.379999999999s)]
*  I don't know what I'm doing. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5263.219999999999s)]
*  They say here, that's how grimy, [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5264.259999999999s)]
*  like, I'm still just crazy. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5265.82s)]
*  Like here, here go a map. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5266.86s)]
*  I'm like, oh, you want me to walk in the dark [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5270.0599999999995s)]
*  and look at a fucking map while I got a tray of drinks? [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5271.0599999999995s)]
*  Great. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5272.98s)]
*  But that's how it is in life too. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5274.139999999999s)]
*  You just got to jump your ass in that water and swim. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5275.82s)]
*  If I'm not mistaken, it was freaking, [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5278.379999999999s)]
*  was it Louis CK that night? [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5280.219999999999s)]
*  I don't remember, it could have been him. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5282.799999999999s)]
*  And it was just stacked. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5285.5599999999995s)]
*  And it was like, we need the help, [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5287.0s)]
*  we need the extra hands, y'all. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5287.92s)]
*  I was working in blue jeans. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5288.759999999999s)]
*  Jesus. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5290.879999999999s)]
*  And they just threw me a Comedy Story shirt [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5292.12s)]
*  and it just went from there. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5294.0s)]
*  But after that, it was dead for like two years. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5295.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5298.679999999999s)]
*  Well, that was just, [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5299.5199999999995s)]
*  it would be like that if someone big would come. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5300.879999999999s)]
*  If someone big would come, [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5303.639999999999s)]
*  then it would build up again. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5304.839999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5306.16s)]
*  And it'll happen again. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5307.0s)]
*  It always happens with that place. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5308.839999999999s)]
*  It rises. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5310.12s)]
*  It's just an iconic place. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5311.26s)]
*  It's always, when I was a kid, [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5313.42s)]
*  in 1988, when I first did Stand Up, [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5315.34s)]
*  I was at Stitches in Boston. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5317.58s)]
*  And I remember thinking about the Comedy Store, [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5319.1s)]
*  like that's Mecca. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5320.86s)]
*  That was Mecca. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5322.42s)]
*  Like I had to get there. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5323.26s)]
*  I had to get there. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5324.3s)]
*  Like that was my goal always, [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5325.14s)]
*  was to get to the Comedy Store. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5327.38s)]
*  I didn't even know why. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5328.38s)]
*  I didn't even know how. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5329.46s)]
*  It was like this thought, [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5330.82s)]
*  like I was terrible. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5332.02s)]
*  I was an open mic'er. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5333.42s)]
*  And I was like, the Comedy Store, [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5334.54s)]
*  that's where Richard Pryor used to work out. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5336.06s)]
*  That's where Sam Kinison used to work out. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5338.02s)]
*  And I was like, I gotta get there. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5340.52s)]
*  And I remember getting there and being like, [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5341.8s)]
*  this is the Comedy Store? [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5343.28s)]
*  Like this is it? [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5344.24s)]
*  Yeah, it was surprising. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5345.52s)]
*  Yeah, but then I saw a really good, [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5347.48s)]
*  I kept going back. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5349.32s)]
*  And then I saw Domarara there. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5350.36s)]
*  And I saw all these other people. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5352.04s)]
*  Then I got there earlier in the day. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5353.2s)]
*  And I realized, if you get there at nine o'clock, [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5354.44s)]
*  it's more packed. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5357.0s)]
*  I was showing up at 11, 11.30, [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5358.16s)]
*  after I'd gotten off of work on a sitcom. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5360.74s)]
*  Oh, I was about to say, where were you working? [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5363.08s)]
*  I was doing this sitcom called Hardball. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5365.0s)]
*  That's what I came over to do. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5366.94s)]
*  The pilot was me and Jim Brewer. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5369.04s)]
*  And a bunch of other people that were in, [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5371.4s)]
*  like mostly actors. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5375.719999999999s)]
*  And it was on Fox. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5377.4s)]
*  And it didn't go, it went like six episodes. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5379.4s)]
*  But I had already moved here [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5382.88s)]
*  and I already got an apartment, so I stayed. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5383.719999999999s)]
*  But the big thing to me was becoming a paid regular [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5385.88s)]
*  at the Comedy Store, which I think happened [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5389.759999999999s)]
*  after the show got canceled. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5391.28s)]
*  I think I was there for quite a few months. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5394.0s)]
*  I was a non-paid regular. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5395.44s)]
*  So I had to go on at the end of the show. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5397.1s)]
*  After everyone was already done, then I could go up. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5398.98s)]
*  How was your relationship with Mitzi? [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5401.0599999999995s)]
*  Oh, it was amazing. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5402.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5403.74s)]
*  I couldn't believe I was talking to her. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5404.58s)]
*  Because me, it was like, that was the godmother. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5406.58s)]
*  I could be in her presence and she would give me advice. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5409.1s)]
*  But she would tell me, she thought I was funny. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5412.26s)]
*  She'd tell me, oh, that was hilarious. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5413.94s)]
*  I'd be like, I just couldn't believe it. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5416.0599999999995s)]
*  When she told me that I was a paid regular, [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5419.42s)]
*  it was the happiest day of my life. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5420.86s)]
*  I couldn't believe it. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5423.46s)]
*  How was the process with you? [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5424.42s)]
*  Because when I became a paid regular, I had to showcase. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5426.26s)]
*  Did you have to showcase, or did she just watch you [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5429.38s)]
*  for a period of time and didn't come to you and tell you? [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5431.66s)]
*  I showcased. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5435.0199999999995s)]
*  I did my first set and she said I could be [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5436.34s)]
*  a non-paid regular. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5438.46s)]
*  And so I did that for, like I said, a few months. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5439.78s)]
*  And then I'd get to showcase again to be a paid regular. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5442.099999999999s)]
*  And I had a great set. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5444.98s)]
*  And one of the reasons why I had a great set [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5446.46s)]
*  was there's this guy named The Todd. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5448.179999999999s)]
*  That's what he'd call himself, The Todd. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5449.86s)]
*  And he was friends with Pauly Shore. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5451.62s)]
*  And he used to be, he was on, I saw him on MTV [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5453.139999999999s)]
*  before I even did comedy. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5455.92s)]
*  I saw him on MTV half hour comedy hour. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5457.48s)]
*  Maybe it was like an open mic or when I saw him. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5459.639999999999s)]
*  I can't remember. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5461.179999999999s)]
*  But I remember seeing that guy on TV [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5462.0199999999995s)]
*  and then being around him at the store. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5463.839999999999s)]
*  And he was a really nice guy. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5465.74s)]
*  And one of the things that he said, [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5466.799999999999s)]
*  he said I sat next to Mitzi when you went on stage [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5468.32s)]
*  and I laughed really hard at all your jokes [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5471.0s)]
*  because you're really funny. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5473.179999999999s)]
*  And I really want you to be a paid regular, [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5474.16s)]
*  but you're gonna do that for other people someday too. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5476.5599999999995s)]
*  He said that to me. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5478.679999999999s)]
*  All the help helps. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5479.5199999999995s)]
*  But that's a real help. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5481.379999999999s)]
*  If you could sit next to Mitzi, [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5482.48s)]
*  if she knew, if you're a legit comic [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5484.38s)]
*  and she knew that you respected the person on stage [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5486.46s)]
*  and that you wanted to see their set and that you laughed, [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5488.3s)]
*  Mitzi, you were, without telling Mitzi anything, [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5490.58s)]
*  you were cosigned. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5493.3s)]
*  You were cosigning. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5494.54s)]
*  So he cosigned for me. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5495.38s)]
*  And I never forgot. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5496.86s)]
*  And then he got really sick. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5497.679999999999s)]
*  Something happened. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5499.82s)]
*  He had a real brain problem. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5500.66s)]
*  Oh no. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5502.58s)]
*  Yeah, real bad where, [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5503.42s)]
*  I don't even know if he's still alive. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5504.86s)]
*  But he came back to the store [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5507.34s)]
*  and there was something really wrong with him, unfortunately. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5510.219999999999s)]
*  Some sort of health issue with his brain. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5513.5599999999995s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5516.2s)]
*  It was sad. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5517.04s)]
*  But I learned from him. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5517.86s)]
*  And then there was like an interesting moment for me [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5519.48s)]
*  because I was like, oh, that totally makes sense. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5521.719999999999s)]
*  Like, and that's what you should do. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5524.08s)]
*  That's the dude. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5525.36s)]
*  The Todd, huh? [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5526.2s)]
*  That's him. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5527.0199999999995s)]
*  That's the Todd. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5527.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5528.7s)]
*  He was on the MTV half hour comedy. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5529.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I was about to say, he looks very, very familiar. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5530.36s)]
*  Yeah, he was in the eighties. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5532.5199999999995s)]
*  He was a guy that was like, [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5534.28s)]
*  one of the guys you would see on TV. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5536.44s)]
*  He had a unique name and, [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5538.799999999999s)]
*  it was a good comic. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5540.639999999999s)]
*  He's a funny guy. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5541.48s)]
*  But that was what was big. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5542.68s)]
*  It was that he helped me. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5544.0s)]
*  I like that. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5545.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5546.52s)]
*  I like to help. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5547.34s)]
*  Because you know, like you said earlier, [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5548.18s)]
*  some people don't want to see your eyes. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5550.320000000001s)]
*  They don't want to see. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5552.12s)]
*  Well, some people, they just think there's, [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5553.08s)]
*  they have a famine mentality. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5554.92s)]
*  They think that there's only so much success [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5557.24s)]
*  and so much love and so much positivity out there [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5559.320000000001s)]
*  and they want it all for themselves. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5561.68s)]
*  You know, I came at a crossroads. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5563.28s)]
*  Like there were times when I had to hold myself accountable [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5565.96s)]
*  for being like that. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5569.92s)]
*  Be mad at others for having more to me. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5570.84s)]
*  And one day I just sat down and I'm just like, [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5573.900000000001s)]
*  yo, that ain't your lane. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5575.7s)]
*  That's not your plan. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5578.58s)]
*  That's not your journey. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5579.42s)]
*  So I had to like really pull myself out of that [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5580.3s)]
*  and be like, yo, you know, [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5583.02s)]
*  your life is different from everybody else's life [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5586.1s)]
*  and your journey is different. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5588.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5590.3s)]
*  You know, so once I got out of that, [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5591.14s)]
*  that stupid mentality, like things really start, [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5593.74s)]
*  and I put all that energy into like really focusing [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5596.46s)]
*  on myself and my work. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5598.74s)]
*  Like things really shifted in my life [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5599.84s)]
*  when I started worrying about what other people were doing [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5602.32s)]
*  and what they had. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5604.04s)]
*  Good for you. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5604.88s)]
*  Good for you. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5605.72s)]
*  What do you remember what happened to you [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5606.54s)]
*  or why you made that switch? [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5609.04s)]
*  Well, I remember just saying to myself one day, [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5611.28s)]
*  that's a talented motherfucker. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5615.5199999999995s)]
*  Why is you mad? [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5616.679999999999s)]
*  And I would say to myself, I don't even know. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5619.2s)]
*  If the only reason why you upset is because it ain't you, [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5623.679999999999s)]
*  that's a problem. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5627.5s)]
*  But it's common. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5629.820000000001s)]
*  For me, it was a problem. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5630.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5632.42s)]
*  I used to feel like that when I was younger [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5633.26s)]
*  and I recognized it in myself. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5635.18s)]
*  And I was like, oh, this is a weakness, [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5636.46s)]

*  because they think they're gonna like diminish them [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5648.46s)]

*  I used to have it all the time. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5705.780000000001s)]
*  It's a big part of being a person. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5707.34s)]
*  You see someone who, especially in the beginning [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5709.580000000001s)]
*  because you're just trying to make it. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5712.200000000001s)]
*  So you're so ambitious. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5714.4800000000005s)]
*  You can't wait to go on stage [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5716.04s)]
*  and you see someone on stage bomb [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5717.6s)]
*  and you're like happy they bombed. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5719.08s)]
*  Like good, fuck them. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5720.68s)]
*  That's another thing I had to stop doing. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5721.52s)]
*  When I was coming up at the store [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5723.96s)]
*  and before I was a paid regular, [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5726.200000000001s)]
*  if I would do the friends and family portion, [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5728.62s)]
*  I would be happy that I was going after someone [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5732.72s)]
*  who I knew weren't as good as me. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5735.76s)]
*  And then my life started to change again [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5738.320000000001s)]
*  when I started saying, no, fuck that. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5740.400000000001s)]
*  I want the person in front of me to be dope as fuck. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5743.08s)]
*  So like SNL in a pitch meeting, [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5746.92s)]
*  I go after this guy who always light the room up [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5749.72s)]
*  with a pitch. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5752.32s)]
*  And I went up to him and I'm like, bro, you make me better. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5753.68s)]
*  Cause I know I gotta come. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5756.24s)]
*  If I go after you in that meeting, [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5758.12s)]
*  I know I gotta come hard. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5759.4800000000005s)]
*  So you are fueling me to keep the energy of the room [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5760.72s)]
*  when you go and then I have to go after you. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5765.8s)]
*  Cause I don't wanna bring it down. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5767.64s)]
*  So he's making me work harder, but not in like this, [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5769.12s)]
*  like I'm not envious of him. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5773.14s)]
*  He's helping me and I like his help [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5775.599999999999s)]
*  by him just being himself. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5778.22s)]
*  Yeah, that's the way to think about it. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5779.82s)]
*  So once I changed that mentality of, [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5782.3s)]
*  I want the best person in the room to be before me, [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5785.82s)]
*  that's when I started getting better as well. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5788.68s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5791.099999999999s)]
*  So I'm gonna put it like this. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5792.18s)]
*  That's when I started being more prepared [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5796.38s)]
*  as well, that's when my preparation changed [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5800.08s)]
*  to going on stages too. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5802.320000000001s)]
*  I'm just like, all right bet. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5803.860000000001s)]
*  I need to be a little bit more organized on stage. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5805.38s)]
*  I need to know when my jokes is coming. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5807.52s)]
*  I need to make sure I keep it nice and tight [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5809.0s)]
*  cause I wanna keep the energy in the room. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5811.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it also, it makes you rise up to that person's RPMs. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5813.4800000000005s)]
*  That's why the Comedy Store was so good. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5819.18s)]
*  You would be working with all these killers [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5820.68s)]
*  and you had to, you couldn't be lazy. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5822.9400000000005s)]
*  One thing that comedians like to do [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5825.9800000000005s)]
*  is they like to bring someone on the road with them [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5828.120000000001s)]
*  that's soft. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5829.8s)]
*  So that person just sort of like goes up [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5831.160000000001s)]
*  and does like a passable job [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5833.120000000001s)]
*  and then they can go up and clean up like a hero. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5834.88s)]
*  But my thought was like A, that's not helping me at all [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5837.360000000001s)]
*  and B, that's not good for the audience. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5839.88s)]
*  So I would just bring the most murderous, ruthless comics [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5842.08s)]
*  that I could find. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5845.4400000000005s)]
*  I started working with Joey cause I couldn't follow him. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5846.400000000001s)]
*  I brought Joey on the road with me [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5848.9400000000005s)]
*  cause I had trouble following him once in New Jersey. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5850.320000000001s)]
*  I'm like, I'm bringing Joey on the road everywhere. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5852.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5853.96s)]
*  Oh, I love Joey. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5854.8s)]
*  Joey, when he came into his own, [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5855.620000000001s)]
*  there was a time in like the late 90s [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5857.36s)]
*  where Joey came into his own [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5860.0199999999995s)]
*  where he just really figured it out, [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5861.38s)]
*  where he was unstoppable. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5863.0s)]
*  He was unstoppable. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5864.44s)]
*  Cause he had decided that Hollywood [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5865.339999999999s)]
*  was never gonna give him any love. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5866.94s)]
*  And so he was just, [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5868.54s)]
*  all he wanted was the respect of the comics and to kill. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5869.9s)]
*  And he was just always on fire, always on fire. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5873.7s)]
*  And you would go on after him. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5877.339999999999s)]
*  It's like, how are you gonna compete with that? [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5878.46s)]
*  How are you gonna ride that wave? [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5880.5s)]
*  And so taking him on the road with me, [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5882.66s)]
*  it like made me sharper. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5884.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5886.0199999999995s)]
*  This guy's just destroyed. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5887.12s)]
*  And then by the way, after a while, people knew who he was. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5888.32s)]
*  So in the beginning, people didn't know him. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5891.12s)]
*  They were like, what the fuck is this? [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5893.5199999999995s)]
*  And then they would see him go on stage [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5895.32s)]
*  and they would get excited. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5897.4s)]
*  They're like, oh shit, that's Joey Diaz. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5898.36s)]

*  He don't touch that microphone. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5967.68s)]

*  in front of a Cuban audience. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=5971.72s)]

*  He's so out of his fucking mind. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6174.78s)]
*  They're gonna turn me into a monster. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6175.62s)]
*  His goofy ass. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6178.54s)]
*  And no doubt. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6179.94s)]
*  He started off in the belly room, [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6182.62s)]
*  moved it into the main room. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6184.3s)]
*  Now he out here in Austin. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6186.02s)]
*  He did what he said he was gonna do. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6189.02s)]
*  That show's unstoppable. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6191.54s)]
*  It's such a good idea to have comics go up and do one minute. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6192.66s)]
*  And then you have regulars like William Montgomery, [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6197.3s)]
*  Hans Kim, David Lucas, they all do a minute every week. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6200.38s)]
*  A new minute every week. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6202.78s)]
*  Every week. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6203.96s)]
*  So David will write a new minute every week. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6204.8s)]
*  And so many times, like David is very prolific. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6206.639999999999s)]
*  And so many times David will take that bit [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6209.28s)]
*  and then he'll be doing it like when he works with me [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6211.32s)]
*  all the time. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6213.84s)]
*  So David and I are doing shows like most Tuesdays [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6214.679999999999s)]
*  and Wednesdays. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6216.9s)]
*  And so he'll take these bits from one minute [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6217.84s)]
*  and now all of a sudden he's got a whole new [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6220.679999999999s)]
*  giant one minute chunk. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6223.2s)]
*  And that's a part of his regular act now [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6224.8s)]
*  because of this one minute a week thing. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6226.639999999999s)]
*  It's an incredible resource for up and coming comedians [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6228.48s)]
*  and Hans Kim is doing that too. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6231.620000000001s)]
*  Every week you gotta be on point. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6233.54s)]
*  It's like SNL in a lot of ways. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6234.9800000000005s)]
*  We have to create every week. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6236.620000000001s)]
*  And there's only three of them. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6238.5s)]
*  I can't wait to do a Kill Tony tonight [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6242.46s)]
*  cause I'm gonna say roast me. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6244.18s)]
*  I just wanna be roast, I just love when David roasts my ass. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6245.38s)]
*  David's the best. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6248.06s)]
*  David and Tony, when those two are roasting each other, [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6249.700000000001s)]

*  The problem with that is like it's great for sure [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6422.780000000001s)]
*  but I need alone time and that's my alone time. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6425.9400000000005s)]
*  When I work out I like to put AirPods on [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6429.660000000001s)]
*  so I listen to music and I just get cranking [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6432.94s)]
*  and I just get in my own head. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6436.44s)]
*  That's what I like to do. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6437.679999999999s)]
*  I don't want anybody telling me what we're doing next. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6438.5199999999995s)]
*  I know what to do. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6440.599999999999s)]
*  I write it out. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6441.44s)]
*  Well that's my problem. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6442.259999999999s)]
*  If I knew how to work out. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6443.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah but there's a great benefit to having a trainer [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6446.04s)]
*  no doubt but for me it's like what I get out of it personally. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6448.32s)]
*  I've definitely worked with trainers before [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6452.04s)]
*  and I love what I've learned from them [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6453.96s)]
*  but I like that time was just me struggling in my own head. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6455.98s)]
*  That's to me like that's the start of every day. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6461.28s)]
*  Every day I do something and when I do it I set it out. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6463.32s)]
*  I write it out, what am I doing? [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6466.719999999999s)]
*  Figure it out in my head and then I just, [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6468.32s)]
*  in that way I'm just in my own head. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6469.799999999999s)]
*  I don't talk to anybody and I look at my phone. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6471.759999999999s)]
*  I like, I dig that. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6473.839999999999s)]
*  I dig that. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6474.799999999999s)]
*  Do you get into a lot of CrossFit? [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6475.639999999999s)]
*  I do those same kind of movements. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6477.5599999999995s)]
*  I do a lot of kettlebell stuff [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6479.82s)]
*  and I do a lot of body weight stuff. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6481.36s)]
*  So I do a lot of similar things. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6483.959999999999s)]
*  Because you stay strong. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6485.679999999999s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6488.24s)]
*  So I don't think you, you don't do a lot of cardio do you? [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6489.08s)]
*  I do cardio. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6490.780000000001s)]
*  Really? [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6491.62s)]
*  Yeah, I do airdine bike. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6492.4400000000005s)]
*  You know what that is? [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6493.820000000001s)]
*  Uh-uh. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6494.66s)]
*  And I do rounds in the bag but the airdine bike is a, [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6495.4800000000005s)]
*  it's a, you like, you do your arms and your legs [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6498.14s)]
*  at the same time. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6501.74s)]
*  Oh yes, yes, yes, okay, yes. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6502.58s)]
*  I have this rogue echo bike. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6503.58s)]
*  It's brutal, it's brutal. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6505.16s)]
*  And so I do sprints on this thing. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6506.62s)]
*  So you do 20 second sprints with 10 second rests [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6508.46s)]
*  and I do that for eight reps [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6511.14s)]
*  and I do that for 10 repetitions. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6512.46s)]
*  So I do 10 rounds of 20 second sprint, 10 second rest, [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6514.18s)]
*  20 second sprint, do that eight times. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6518.72s)]
*  Get my heart rate down below 100 and then do it again. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6521.16s)]
*  And then get my heart rate back up. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6524.16s)]
*  You do that 10 times? [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6525.0s)]
*  10 times a row, yeah. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6526.04s)]
*  Oh wow. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6528.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so that's my cardio. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6529.5199999999995s)]
*  I do that at least once a week. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6530.599999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6532.08s)]
*  And then I do, yeah I don't do that a lot. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6532.92s)]
*  Then I do rounds in the bag and I do other stuff for cardio. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6534.639999999999s)]
*  I pull a sled. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6537.28s)]
*  That bag is some serious, [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6538.28s)]
*  that bag will do some serious damage. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6539.679999999999s)]
*  Sure, yeah. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6541.36s)]
*  You'll shred very fast in here with that bag and like, [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6542.2s)]
*  my arms get like, let's say I've just, [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6545.66s)]
*  sometimes if I get depressed, I just stop everything. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6550.34s)]
*  So let's say I stop for like two months. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6552.9400000000005s)]
*  If I get back in the gym and get on that bag, [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6554.860000000001s)]
*  I shred so fast and so hard within three weeks, [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6557.18s)]
*  I'm like 10, 12 pounds down off the bag. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6560.62s)]
*  It's a lot of calories you're burning too. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6564.5s)]
*  If you wear a chest strap, one of those straps, [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6566.14s)]
*  it measures the amount of calories you're burning. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6567.9800000000005s)]
*  You're burning a shit load of calories in the bag. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6569.740000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's so dynamic. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6572.54s)]
*  There's so much movement. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6573.88s)]
*  So your heart rate is jacked. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6574.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I'll go, my trainer's like, [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6576.44s)]
*  look if you ever go to a boxing gym without me, [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6579.24s)]
*  you have to go to every bag. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6581.44s)]
*  You do three rounds on every bag. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6582.679999999999s)]
*  So that is one thing I know how to do. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6584.679999999999s)]
*  I don't know how to work out, [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6588.099999999999s)]
*  but I know how to use every bag in the gym. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6589.2s)]
*  That's perfect. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6591.08s)]
*  That's all you really need. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6591.92s)]
*  You want to get in shape. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6592.88s)]
*  Also they have these round timers [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6594.08s)]
*  that'll let you do like the same kind of thing, [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6596.839999999999s)]
*  like sprints and then rest periods. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6600.48s)]
*  So what it'll be like, I think title boxing had one, [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6602.46s)]
*  ringside, ringside had one. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6606.0599999999995s)]
*  And you had like a green light and a yellow light [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6607.58s)]
*  and then a red light. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6612.0199999999995s)]
*  And the red light was in between rounds, [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6613.219999999999s)]
*  then you would rest and the green light was sprint. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6615.04s)]
*  So the green light, you would, [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6617.5599999999995s)]
*  ba ba ba ba boom, ba ba ba ba boom, [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6618.4s)]
*  just beat the fuck out of the bag. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6620.339999999999s)]
*  And then the yellow light would come on [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6621.66s)]
*  and then you would just sort of tap it and move around. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6623.179999999999s)]
*  And you would just kind of catch your breath back up. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6625.66s)]
*  And then the green light would come back on you, [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6628.5s)]
*  ba ba ba ba boom, ba ba. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6630.0599999999995s)]
*  So it would give you like structure. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6631.58s)]
*  Like during that green time, you sprint. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6633.6s)]
*  During the yellow time, you lay back. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6636.24s)]
*  Oh yeah, and it'll, so basically that'll be like, [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6638.16s)]
*  each light be a minute, I'm guessing, right? [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6641.32s)]
*  I don't know how they do it. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6643.4s)]
*  I don't know how it does it. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6644.96s)]
*  I want to say it's 30 seconds. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6646.16s)]
*  I think actually, no. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6647.68s)]
*  I think what it is is adjustable. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6649.32s)]
*  I think you could set the round, [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6651.16s)]
*  I think the round thing would go to as much as five minutes [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6653.0s)]
*  and you could choose the intervals. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6655.5599999999995s)]
*  Okay. Yeah. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6656.92s)]
*  Yeah, I'm really getting deep into this. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6657.88s)]
*  I don't know if my trainer be gassing me up, man. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6660.46s)]
*  I think he'd be gassing me. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6663.02s)]
*  I don't know, but he's like, yo, [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6664.06s)]
*  he's like, you could go out and fight. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6665.780000000001s)]
*  Like I think I'm gonna get you somebody to spar with. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6667.860000000001s)]
*  I'm like, I don't know if I'm ready for that. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6669.900000000001s)]
*  He's like, yo, you ready? [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6671.06s)]
*  You know, I want it. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6672.820000000001s)]
*  You have heavy bags right next door. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6673.660000000001s)]
*  You can show me. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6674.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah, he want me to fight. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6675.5s)]
*  Show me what you got, punky. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6677.02s)]
*  Hey, hey, I'll hit that bag. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6678.54s)]
*  You know, we got that I love is a water bag. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6680.38s)]
*  It's like a big ball filled with water. [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6682.14s)]
*  You ever hit one of those? [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6685.22s)]
*  I don't. Oh, it's nice. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6686.860000000001s)]
*  The only thing I've done with water is, [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6688.4400000000005s)]
*  I don't know what you call it, [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6691.92s)]
*  but they got handles on it. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6692.88s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6694.0s)]
*  And I'll just do like these little plungers [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6694.84s)]
*  that shred you all in your bag and stuff. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6697.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, because the water's moving. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6700.88s)]
*  You have to kind of adjust to the movement of the water. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6702.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, those are great. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6704.360000000001s)]
*  I like stuff like that, like clubs. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6705.52s)]
*  You ever use those metal clubs, steel clubs? [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6707.320000000001s)]
*  You pick them up. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6709.92s)]
*  They're called club bells. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6710.92s)]
*  It's like a long pole. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6712.320000000001s)]
*  It almost looks like a weapon [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6713.64s)]
*  and you're like swinging them above your head. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6714.92s)]
*  It's all about controlling this awkward weight. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6716.820000000001s)]
*  Oh no. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6720.38s)]
*  Or like a mace, you ever use a mace? [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6721.22s)]
*  Same thing? [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6722.34s)]
*  No, I usually just do that with the heavy ball. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6723.9800000000005s)]
*  Oh, medicine ball? [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6727.18s)]
*  That's good too. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6728.820000000001s)]
*  That's good too. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6729.66s)]
*  You could do a bunch of shit like that with a medicine ball. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6730.4800000000005s)]
*  But the thing about clubs and maces is that it's awkward. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6732.62s)]
*  So there's this long metal piece with a mace [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6736.9400000000005s)]
*  and then the end of it is the weight. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6739.780000000001s)]
*  So you're holding onto this thing. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6741.46s)]
*  Understand. [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6742.860000000001s)]
*  So it's all this leverage and you're swinging it around. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6743.7s)]
*  It's really good for your shoulders and your core [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6746.4800000000005s)]
*  and works your leg, works your whole body. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6747.92s)]
*  Yeah, that working out is serious. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6750.56s)]
*  Serious, Bunky. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6752.280000000001s)]
*  It's also good for the dome. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6753.76s)]
*  That's the most important part of it. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6755.22s)]
*  I do feel a lot more, [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6757.0s)]
*  like whenever I work out before I do anything, [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6760.6s)]
*  my brain is ahead of me. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6762.8s)]
*  Yes, yeah. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6764.92s)]
*  It's fired up. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6766.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it doesn't stop. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6767.320000000001s)]
*  And my girlfriend, she's a little thick one. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6769.84s)]
*  She bigoted me. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6773.160000000001s)]
*  One time, I don't know what happened, [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6774.5s)]
*  she came sit on top of me on the sofa and I stood up. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6776.38s)]
*  I walked up to the kitchen and she was like, [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6780.299999999999s)]
*  what the fuck? [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6782.86s)]
*  She said, I gotta call money. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6783.7s)]
*  I called my trainer, she's like, [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6785.46s)]
*  I gotta call him right away. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6786.7s)]
*  They get on the phone, she was like, [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6788.28s)]
*  man, this bitch is strong. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6789.7s)]
*  She's like, you got my baby picking me up. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6794.04s)]
*  Ah! [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6796.7s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6799.46s)]
*  I didn't know I was that strong either. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6800.42s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6802.5s)]
*  I gotta do a lot of leg work. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6804.879999999999s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6807.12s)]
*  All your strength come from below. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6808.44s)]
*  So I do a whole bunch of squats. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6811.28s)]
*  I do 100 pushups a day every day, straight up. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6813.2s)]
*  Yeah, I start off, I got to. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6815.599999999999s)]
*  How many do you do in a row? [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6817.16s)]
*  I could do 40 in a row. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6819.5199999999995s)]
*  Wow. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6820.759999999999s)]
*  I could do 40 pushups in a row. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6821.599999999999s)]
*  That's impressive. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6822.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm working up to doing 100 in a row. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6823.96s)]
*  This guy did this play one time maybe 15 years ago [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6825.639999999999s)]
*  and this guy was like, all right, [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6828.24s)]
*  time for me to get my pushups in. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6829.32s)]
*  He did like 300 pushups in a row. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6830.919999999999s)]
*  In a row? [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6833.3s)]
*  In a row. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6834.38s)]
*  What's the world record for the amount of pushups [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6835.219999999999s)]
*  someone's ever done in a row? [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6837.58s)]
*  I would like to know that. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6839.3s)]
*  Because I would imagine it would be close [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6841.58s)]
*  to the world record. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6843.38s)]
*  Like how many pushups can someone do [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6844.54s)]
*  before their arms fall apart? [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6846.38s)]
*  I think it's like 500, 600 maybe? [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6847.86s)]
*  I guess it also would depend on [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6849.139999999999s)]
*  how heavy the person is too. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6850.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6852.099999999999s)]
*  Like if you're a heavy person, [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6852.94s)]
*  that's a big, if you're Bert Kreischer. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6853.86s)]
*  Are you watching this? [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6856.0199999999995s)]
*  They got this show on Netflix right now. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6856.92s)]
*  It's called like the Top 100 or something like that. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6858.86s)]
*  It's just like all these guys and girls, [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6860.9s)]
*  ladies and men from Asia. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6863.679999999999s)]
*  They all Asian. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6867.96s)]
*  And it's like, it's, oh God, what is it called? [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6869.32s)]
*  But they go into this room and it's like whoever's stronger [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6872.5199999999995s)]
*  and whoever's, and the men compete against the women as well. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6876.08s)]
*  They had this one competition where the guy [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6880.28s)]
*  was competing against a woman [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6882.04s)]
*  and he had his knee on her chest [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6883.48s)]
*  and everybody was like, come on man, come on. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6885.5199999999995s)]
*  And he's looking at him and he's like. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6888.0s)]
*  Competing in what way? [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6888.839999999999s)]
*  I got to, man, this show. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6891.179999999999s)]
*  What's the most record pushups? [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6893.0599999999995s)]
*  I'm trying to find the real truth. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6895.139999999999s)]
*  It said it's 10,000. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6896.459999999999s)]
*  What? [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6897.62s)]
*  In a row? [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6898.459999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6899.28s)]
*  Breaking the record of 7,650. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6900.12s)]
*  Both sound fake. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6902.54s)]
*  But. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6904.58s)]
*  There's a video that says why that's probably fake. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6905.419999999999s)]
*  So I was trying to find another number [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6906.82s)]
*  while you were saying something. [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6907.9s)]
*  And then she brought up the show [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6908.74s)]
*  that I was trying to then get an answer for. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6910.339999999999s)]
*  So here's the show. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6911.9s)]
*  Yes. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6914.459999999999s)]
*  Physical 100. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6915.299999999999s)]
*  Man, this show got me on a, [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6916.599999999999s)]
*  now it got its slow parts [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6919.6s)]
*  because it got to do a lot of introductions [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6920.64s)]
*  and a lot of things. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6922.32s)]
*  Is that Akiyama? [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6923.36s)]
*  It's in Korea for sure. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6925.64s)]
*  That might be Akiyama. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6927.8s)]
*  Yo, no. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6929.12s)]
*  The guy with the big head in the background? [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6929.96s)]
*  Yo, it's a lot of people, [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6932.24s)]
*  it's a lot of famous Asian fighters. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6934.12s)]
*  Well yeah, that's what I'm thinking. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6937.32s)]
*  Well Akiyama, they call him Sexyama. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6938.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6940.72s)]
*  Yoshihiro Akiyama. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6941.64s)]
*  He's a world famous MMA fighter that fought in Pride. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6942.88s)]
*  They call him Sexyama [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6946.28s)]
*  because he's like super tan and super jacked. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6947.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6950.14s)]
*  Pull up a video of Akiyama fighting. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6950.9800000000005s)]
*  Okay, here it is. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6954.86s)]
*  This is this physical 100. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6957.5s)]
*  The whole survival process that will take place in here. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6960.5s)]
*  Oh, it's Squid Games. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6963.46s)]
*  Will be broadcast globally. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6964.62s)]
*  Squid Games. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6967.32s)]
*  And it's stuff like with the mind as well. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6968.34s)]
*  So it's like you don't have to be the strongest [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6970.54s)]
*  or the fastest, you just gotta be strategic. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6972.34s)]
*  Oh, look at this. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6974.78s)]
*  Whoever has the ball at the end of three minutes [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6977.120000000001s)]

*  Oh, interesting. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6979.88s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6983.040000000001s)]
*  Oh wow. [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6984.8s)]
*  So they're duking it out for this fucking ball. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6986.120000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6988.200000000001s)]
*  Oh, that's a good idea. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6989.040000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and that's just one challenge. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6989.860000000001s)]
*  So the last challenge, the sand. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6991.200000000001s)]
*  So that's the last one, the new episode come on tomorrow. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6992.96s)]
*  No shit. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6996.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6997.200000000001s)]
*  That's a good idea. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6998.040000000001s)]
*  Someone's gonna get fucked up though. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=6998.860000000001s)]
*  They're duking it out on a wooden battleship. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7000.4800000000005s)]
*  That seems like a recipe for a broken leg. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7003.200000000001s)]
*  But the thing is, now that is gonna be a team thing. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7004.52s)]
*  So everybody is thinking, okay, [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7007.38s)]
*  we have to have all strong people. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7009.780000000001s)]
*  But some of these, you're gonna have to have [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7011.660000000001s)]
*  some light people so they can get like [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7013.26s)]
*  across bridges and stuff. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7015.34s)]
*  And just like. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7016.5s)]
*  Sure. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7017.34s)]
*  The way they, oh man, it's just so good. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7018.8s)]
*  It's so good. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7020.820000000001s)]
*  Look at that dude in the front picture. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7021.660000000001s)]
*  Go back to that picture. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7022.4800000000005s)]
*  Look how jacked that dude is. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7023.700000000001s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7024.860000000001s)]
*  And sometimes the biggest and the strongest lose. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7026.580000000001s)]
*  Of course. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7028.860000000001s)]
*  Because they're not as, [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7029.700000000001s)]
*  they didn't have a game plan going into the event. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7031.879999999999s)]
*  Well also they probably don't have to be as crafty. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7036.16s)]
*  Right. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7038.36s)]
*  Because they're big and strong. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7039.2s)]
*  They think they're just gonna get away with that. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7040.0199999999995s)]
*  And then they find out, oh no, this is like some shit [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7040.96s)]
*  we're off to hang by my hands longer than the other person. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7042.679999999999s)]
*  That's crazy you say that, [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7045.599999999999s)]
*  because that was the first challenge. [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7046.44s)]
*  Oh see we figured that out on a fear factor. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7047.759999999999s)]
*  On fear factor, girls can hang longer than guys can. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7049.5199999999995s)]
*  We had these jacked dudes and they had to hang off [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7052.36s)]
*  of this bar over a bridge. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7055.16s)]
*  And the jacked dudes all fell before the women. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7056.86s)]
*  Because women don't weigh as much. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7059.08s)]
*  No, no. [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7060.02s)]
*  And it's crazy how they just got comfortable. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7061.06s)]
*  Some of them just got comfortable up there [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7064.66s)]
*  just like holding the bar like this. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7065.98s)]
*  I'm like god damn these people are flexible. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7067.5s)]
*  But they got gymnasts up there that's still in the game [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7069.54s)]
*  and still winning and stuff. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7072.72s)]
*  It's deep. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7073.82s)]
*  See if you can find a video of Akiyama fighting. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7074.98s)]
*  This dude was a pride legend. [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7077.5s)]
*  What's the funniest interview you ever did in a, [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7080.38s)]
*  DFC? [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7083.98s)]

*  The funniest, Derek Lewis for sure. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7085.82s)]
*  He took his pants off. [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7087.26s)]
*  And I go Derek, why'd you take your pants off? [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7088.22s)]
*  And he goes my balls was hot. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7090.4s)]
*  And I go I understand sir. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7091.48s)]
*  He just took his shorts off in the middle of the ring [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7094.44s)]
*  after he won. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7096.5199999999995s)]
*  And I'm like why'd you take your pants off? [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7097.679999999999s)]
*  And he goes my balls was hot. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7099.28s)]

*  And he also, this is him with the gi on. [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7105.48s)]
*  He used to fight with the gi on but he fought with no gi. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7108.9s)]
*  Look how jacked he was. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7110.639999999999s)]
*  Oh wow. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7111.88s)]
*  He was an evil fighter man. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7112.72s)]
*  He was badass. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7113.5599999999995s)]
*  Akiyama was legit. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7115.2s)]
*  He was seriously legit. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7116.679999999999s)]
*  He beat Melvin Manhoef I believe. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7117.72s)]
*  He beat him by submission. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7119.74s)]
*  But he was super legit with judo. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7121.38s)]
*  Okay so this. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7124.58s)]
*  Look at this. [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7125.42s)]

*  Tap. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7127.7s)]
*  And Melvin Manhoef, the guy who he just beat [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7128.54s)]
*  was one of the greatest strikers that ever fought in MMA. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7131.12s)]
*  One of the scariest motherfuckers. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7134.78s)]
*  That guy Melvin Manhoef was a destroyer. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7136.82s)]
*  So when Sexyama submitted him that was a big deal. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7139.54s)]
*  Really? [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7142.78s)]

*  That's the guy in the background when you see his face. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7148.88s)]
*  Yes. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7150.48s)]
*  The picture. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7151.32s)]
*  The big head and the other people in front of him. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7152.14s)]
*  That's Akiyama. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7153.72s)]
*  Okay. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7154.84s)]

*  Jesus Christ. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7160.58s)]
*  There's no host. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7161.42s)]
*  The host is just a voice. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7162.24s)]
*  He was on, he was in Pride fighting in the early 2000s. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7163.08s)]
*  Where? [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7167.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7168.0s)]
*  Like what year did Akiyama fight in Pride? [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7168.82s)]
*  If I want to guess like 2006? [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7172.32s)]
*  Somewhere around there? [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7174.84s)]
*  When did he fight? [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7176.36s)]
*  Say when he fought in Pride? [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7177.54s)]
*  Because Pride, when it was a big thing. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7179.179999999999s)]
*  2001. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7181.74s)]
*  2001. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7182.58s)]
*  2002. [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7183.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7184.58s)]
*  Like when the UFC purchased Pride I think in like 2000, [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7185.86s)]
*  what was that, six or seven or something like that? [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7190.34s)]
*  One championship. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7193.139999999999s)]
*  Oh. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7194.7s)]
*  Well he fought in one championship recently. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7195.74s)]
*  That was pretty recently. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7197.679999999999s)]
*  Which is crazy. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7198.7s)]
*  So 20 years. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7199.54s)]
*  2009. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7200.38s)]
*  Woo. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7201.58s)]
*  So 20 years after he first started competing. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7202.42s)]
*  Allen Belcher, UFC. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7205.179999999999s)]
*  So 2009 the UFC bought and brought in Akiyama. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7206.360000000001s)]
*  Wild. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7211.0s)]
*  Wild. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7212.32s)]
*  So now he's hosting that show. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7213.16s)]
*  He's gotta be 50 years old. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7214.12s)]
*  How old is that guy? [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7215.12s)]
*  Yeah he's. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7217.72s)]
*  He's gotta be deep into his 40s. [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7218.56s)]
*  Well you can tell because everybody have [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7220.0s)]
*  a massive amount of respect for him on a show [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7221.68s)]
*  when they speak of him. [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7223.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7224.72s)]
*  And his first one on one battle, [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7225.56s)]
*  so it's 100 of them, [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7228.2s)]
*  and then the first battle half of them were eliminated. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7229.68s)]
*  And that was the ball. [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7232.24s)]
*  So now another half is about to be eliminated by tomorrow [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7233.9400000000005s)]
*  with the sand. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7237.9s)]
*  Now the sand is very strategic [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7240.02s)]
*  because you gotta fill this bag of sand, [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7241.54s)]
*  walk across a bridge and empty it into a tube. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7244.78s)]
*  And whoever have the most in 12 minutes is gonna win. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7247.02s)]
*  Is this all the people that are on it? [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7249.22s)]
*  Yeah there's a lot of fighters and stuff on it too. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7250.06s)]
*  There you go. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7252.14s)]
*  How old is Akiyama? [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7253.62s)]
*  Does it say? [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7257.26s)]
*  47. 47. [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7258.1s)]
*  Damn. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7259.38s)]
*  He looks good too. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7260.38s)]
*  Still fighting. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7261.34s)]
*  He fought in one championship. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7262.18s)]
*  I wanna say within the last three years. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7263.240000000001s)]
*  He looked good too. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7266.12s)]
*  And you know what else to say? [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7267.12s)]
*  That he had all of that background of just [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7269.84s)]
*  being exquisite at what he does. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7275.4400000000005s)]
*  He's very humble when he speaks. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7277.320000000001s)]
*  Cause they do interviews and stuff [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7281.76s)]
*  and he's just sitting up there like, [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7283.68s)]
*  I don't know man. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7285.92s)]
*  It's an English voiceover. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7288.16s)]
*  Right, oh that's not good. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7289.400000000001s)]
*  What is so, [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7291.2s)]
*  I'd rather them just have the subtitles honestly. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7292.78s)]
*  Cause the English voiceovers are so weird. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7294.98s)]
*  Cause they, I don't know. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7296.98s)]
*  Right, you wanna hear the guy's voice. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7297.82s)]
*  Right, right, right, right. [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7298.98s)]
*  And he's like, I don't know man. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7300.78s)]
*  Maybe I made the wrong choice. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7301.98s)]
*  He's so humble in the way he goes into his competitions. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7303.34s)]
*  He's never like, I'm gonna win this. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7306.38s)]
*  You know in the early Bruce Lee movies, [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7308.26s)]
*  they had someone do his voice. [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7309.72s)]
*  Oh really? [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7312.14s)]
*  If you watched the early Bruce Lee movies, [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7312.98s)]
*  someone is talking like this. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7314.38s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7315.78s)]
*  Someone's talking over him. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7316.62s)]
*  Hey guys, we have to go down there and fix this problem. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7317.74s)]
*  Right now. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7320.94s)]
*  Cause every time I watch the If Man movies, [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7322.639999999999s)]
*  I'd rather them leave it, [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7324.32s)]
*  leave just his Chinese accent. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7326.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7329.0s)]
*  Than have the American guy. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7329.839999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah, for sure. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7331.28s)]
*  Speak over it, I hate it. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7333.0s)]
*  No, you want subtitles. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7334.219999999999s)]
*  Cause you wanna hear the inflection in their voice. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7335.639999999999s)]
*  When someone is talking over them like this. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7338.36s)]
*  That seems crazy. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7340.719999999999s)]
*  Especially if it's like a dramatic scene. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7342.4s)]
*  I can't stay with it. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7344.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, is this, [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7347.2s)]
*  I think this is real though. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7348.48s)]
*  I can't tell. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7349.839999999999s)]
*  How the fuck are you on this? [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7350.679999999999s)]
*  That's different. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7352.42s)]
*  I'm just gonna leave it alone. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7353.26s)]
*  Bruce Lee, what was that that we just saw? [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7355.3s)]
*  They have to know if they're real or fake. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7357.540000000001s)]
*  They're mostly fake people just re-uploading them. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7360.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, just don't say Bruce Lee voiceover. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7363.34s)]
*  Right, Bruce Lee had his voice dubbed in early movies. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7366.620000000001s)]
*  Too many people would wanna put up fake ones. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7371.900000000001s)]
*  Dubbed early movies. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7372.740000000001s)]
*  Maybe, but I think the early movies, [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7374.1s)]
*  there's like some pretty obvious examples. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7377.660000000001s)]
*  Just this is gonna take too long now. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7380.200000000001s)]
*  Oh, Jamie. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7382.08s)]
*  I was trying to do it fast. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7383.4400000000005s)]
*  I understand. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7384.52s)]
*  Then we're gonna get lost. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7385.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7386.96s)]
*  See? [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7387.8s)]
*  Okay, there's a lot of different voiceover dubs [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7388.96s)]
*  that he does, I get it. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7392.72s)]
*  But it was just, that was the thing with kung fu movies. [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7394.360000000001s)]
*  Right? [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7396.16s)]
*  And Godzilla too. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7397.0s)]
*  You go watch early Godzilla, it was all dubbed over. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7398.320000000001s)]
*  Hey, Godzilla's coming. [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7401.6s)]
*  This is a real problem guys. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7403.52s)]
*  I hate that. [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7405.8s)]
*  Just give me the real people and let me read the shit. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7406.64s)]

*  By this time, he might have been talking in his own voice. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7427.42s)]
*  I believe he was. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7430.66s)]
*  But I don't think Bruce is gonna do much talking. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7433.2s)]
*  He's just gonna fuck this dude up. [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7434.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7436.26s)]
*  Whoosh, wah. [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7437.1s)]
*  I love, wah. [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7437.92s)]
*  I fucking love watching Bruce Lee. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7439.22s)]
*  The noises. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7440.06s)]
*  I remember hearing those noises going, what is this? [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7441.34s)]
*  By the way, no one can do that now. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7444.02s)]
*  If you think about karate movies, [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7445.66s)]
*  people just do karate. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7447.06s)]
*  Nobody goes, wah. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7448.38s)]
*  There's no swag in fashion, man. [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7451.14s)]
*  He was smooth. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7453.1s)]
*  Oh, he was so smooth. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7454.26s)]
*  I loved him. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7455.5s)]
*  Yeah, and he was an Asian superhero. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7456.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7458.18s)]
*  Which was, they didn't never see that coming. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7459.02s)]
*  This dude out of nowhere throwing karate kicks [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7462.3s)]
*  and doing jujitsu and judo and mixing them all together. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7466.56s)]
*  Nobody saw that coming. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7470.52s)]
*  That guy changed martial arts. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7471.84s)]
*  He did. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7473.8s)]
*  Before the UFC came along, [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7474.64s)]
*  that was the first guy that combined things. [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7475.88s)]
*  He was the one who I kind of opened the door [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7478.12s)]
*  for the UFC in a lot of ways. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7479.8s)]
*  If I'm not mistaken, he also did Wing Chun. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7480.68s)]
*  He did. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7483.0s)]
*  He did, yeah. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7483.84s)]
*  Yeah, that's why I wanna, I have to learn it. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7484.68s)]
*  I gotta figure out when and how, but I gotta get there. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7487.08s)]
*  Yeah, he trained under Yip Man. [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7489.12s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7492.72s)]
*  He trained under him. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7494.240000000001s)]
*  Also, again, if I'm not mistaken, [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7496.18s)]
*  I think it was created by a woman. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7498.58s)]
*  Wing Chun was? [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7500.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7501.3s)]
*  I think you're right. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7502.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7502.96s)]
*  Yeah, but I don't think they know. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7503.780000000001s)]
*  How the fuck could they know? [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7504.900000000001s)]
*  How they know and figure that out? [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7505.740000000001s)]
*  It's just, I just wanna learn how to be lighter on my feet. [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7507.66s)]
*  Okay, well you should do plyometrics, do footwork drills. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7511.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7514.860000000001s)]
*  All right, I could look into that too. [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7516.3s)]
*  There's a ton of guys on Instagram [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7517.740000000001s)]
*  that are boxing coaches that set up those footwork ladders. [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7519.3s)]
*  Ever see those footwork ladders? [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7522.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7523.820000000001s)]
*  You go in and out with the feet and do plyometrics [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7524.8s)]
*  where you jump like ski moves side to side, side to side. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7527.72s)]
*  That's how to get light on your feet. [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7530.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7532.12s)]
*  And then learning how to use it. [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7532.96s)]
*  When I'm on a road and I don't have my trainer, [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7534.48s)]
*  I'll plug in Shaun T. [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7536.88s)]
*  I got his yearly beach body program. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7539.5199999999995s)]
*  Pfft. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7545.28s)]
*  Ha ha ha. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7546.12s)]
*  And I just crank up insanity. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7549.2s)]
*  Or, and he does have a plyometric workout on there too [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7551.18s)]
*  that uses the ladder. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7556.12s)]
*  That's good, yeah. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7557.84s)]
*  But I never do that one. [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7558.88s)]
*  That's a good one. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7560.6s)]
*  You know what else is really good? [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7561.4400000000005s)]
*  What? [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7562.280000000001s)]
*  Skip and rope. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7563.12s)]
*  People don't skip rope. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7563.9400000000005s)]
*  Jumping rope is fantastic. [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7564.780000000001s)]
*  It's one of the best things for your footwork. [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7566.4800000000005s)]
*  It's the reason why boxers do it. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7568.320000000001s)]
*  Because you gotta think about all that time [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7569.96s)]
*  you're just bouncing on your toes. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7572.04s)]
*  A lot of times when you're boxing, you're flat-footed. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7573.76s)]
*  Or you're moving, but you're not moving constantly [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7576.320000000001s)]
*  over and over and over again. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7578.58s)]
*  But if you have the ability to do that, [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7579.9400000000005s)]
*  so if you're skipping rope and you skip rope for 10 minutes, [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7582.1s)]
*  whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo, [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7584.5s)]
*  and you're moving your feet back and forth, [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7586.34s)]
*  that's 10 minutes that you're forcing yourself [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7587.78s)]
*  to bounce up and down on your calves [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7590.5s)]
*  and on the ball of your feet. [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7592.34s)]
*  Oh. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7593.18s)]
*  Because you have to jump over that rope. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7594.0s)]
*  Right, so when you're doing that, [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7595.02s)]
*  you're energizing those muscles, [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7596.4800000000005s)]
*  strengthening those muscles, [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7598.26s)]
*  and then conditioning your body [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7599.66s)]
*  to be able to move like that. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7601.06s)]
*  I need to jump rope. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7602.46s)]
*  See, my problem, Joe, I don't like to jump. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7603.3s)]
*  Who does? [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7607.5s)]
*  I hate it. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7608.42s)]
*  But that's the thing. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7609.72s)]
*  I need to start doing the things that I don't wanna do. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7611.6s)]
*  Especially when it comes down to working out. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7614.400000000001s)]
*  So I do not jump rope in boxing. [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7616.280000000001s)]
*  And I know that that's a big factor. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7618.0s)]
*  And I have to get over myself. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7620.74s)]
*  Jumping rope's a good one. [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7622.68s)]
*  It's a big one. [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7623.96s)]
*  Shadow boxing is another one. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7624.8s)]
*  Shadow boxing with purpose. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7625.88s)]
*  Shadow boxing moving, [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7627.8s)]
*  pretending a punch is coming your way, [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7628.96s)]
*  getting out of the way of it, [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7630.56s)]
*  landing your own shots, pivoting away, like that. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7631.6s)]
*  Picturing someone in front of you. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7634.6s)]
*  Yeah, that's the creativity too. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7636.06s)]
*  You have to have imagination for that. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7637.68s)]
*  I got two pound weights in my office at SNL. [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7639.54s)]
*  And we get to have friends come on Saturdays. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7643.1s)]
*  And my friend came, he saw the weights. [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7645.78s)]
*  He said, man, what you doing with this motherfucking two [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7646.9800000000005s)]
*  pounds, is that your business? [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7648.74s)]
*  Nah, you punk, you full of shit, you ain't doing. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7650.34s)]
*  I'm like, I shadow box if you ought to know [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7652.78s)]
*  with the two pounds. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7656.62s)]
*  I'll do, like if I'm in my office, [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7658.9s)]
*  I'll put on a movie or something [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7660.78s)]
*  until it's my time to go down the set. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7662.1s)]
*  And I'll just sit in my office and I'll shadow box [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7663.62s)]
*  for, I'll go do a round, I'll sit, I'll chill, [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7666.76s)]
*  I'll do another round, I'll sit, I'll chill. [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7670.12s)]
*  Sometimes I'll do four, five rounds before I go downstairs. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7671.5199999999995s)]
*  Good for you. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7673.76s)]
*  And it gets your brain fired up, right? [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7674.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7675.92s)]
*  And I also have to be like, sorry if I stink up, [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7676.76s)]
*  I'm sweaty, up and upstairs moving around. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7678.5599999999995s)]
*  But those endorphins get flowing. [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7681.24s)]
*  If there was a pill that could make you feel [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7683.0s)]
*  like you feel after you work out, everybody would take it. [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7684.679999999999s)]
*  No side effects. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7687.04s)]
*  There's a pill, it's called workout. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7689.4s)]
*  It's just not a pill. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7690.96s)]
*  But it gives you the effect of the perfect mixture [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7692.639999999999s)]
*  of a relieving of anxiety, [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7695.820000000001s)]
*  the strengthening of all your connections. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7697.900000000001s)]
*  You feel yourself more. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7700.9400000000005s)]
*  And if you gotta be physical, [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7702.38s)]
*  I love a good workout before a set. [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7704.06s)]
*  Because you work out and then you blow the anxiety [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7705.9800000000005s)]
*  out of your system and you feel loose. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7708.88s)]
*  You just feel good when you get up there. [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7710.62s)]
*  I would do 50 pushups right before my set. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7712.02s)]
*  Or a couple of jumping jacks before my set. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7715.42s)]
*  That's good. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7717.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, get the blood flowing. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7718.74s)]
*  Joey Diaz would yell at us. [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7720.74s)]
*  That's what he would do. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7722.5s)]
*  I had to teach people that Joey's not really mad at you. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7723.42s)]
*  He's just getting fired up for going on stage. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7726.599999999999s)]

*  Yeah, you fucking cocksuckers. [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7729.8s)]

*  I'm like, he's just, that's how Joey gets fired up. [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7733.5199999999995s)]
*  He'll hug you when he gets off stage. [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7735.5599999999995s)]
*  Trust me, you just gotta let him go. [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7737.04s)]
*  Yeah, we all got our shit. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7738.679999999999s)]
*  Hell yeah. [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7742.0s)]
*  I think I'm gonna get in the ring with somebody soon. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7744.76s)]
*  You thinking about it for real? [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7746.48s)]
*  I'm thinking about- Have you ever been punched? [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7747.88s)]
*  So yes, my trainer, he teaches me a lot. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7750.36s)]
*  He's like, if you don't keep your hands up, [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7753.620000000001s)]
*  I'm gonna sneak you. [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7754.900000000001s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7755.740000000001s)]
*  So I done got hit a couple times. [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7756.740000000001s)]
*  And I know a real punch hurt [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7758.34s)]
*  because he don't even hit me for real. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7761.02s)]
*  He'll just kinda just- Touch you. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7763.54s)]
*  But it's brutal. [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7765.700000000001s)]
*  So I can't even imagine getting hit. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7767.860000000001s)]
*  But I have been hit, but I ain't been hit. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7771.42s)]
*  Yeah, you don't wanna get hit. [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7773.900000000001s)]
*  Fuck, you gotta preserve your brain. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7774.740000000001s)]

*  I'm swinging out, I'm pivoting out. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7784.28s)]
*  That's the most important thing. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7785.36s)]
*  I'm not saying I ain't never gonna get hit, [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7787.12s)]
*  but I know how to get out the way. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7788.5599999999995s)]
*  For my money, Floyd Mayweather is the best ever [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7790.16s)]
*  because he's the guy that got hit the least. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7792.759999999999s)]
*  He's a defensive boxer, I like it. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7794.36s)]
*  A lot of people don't like it [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7798.879999999999s)]
*  because he is not aggressive in the ring. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7799.98s)]
*  He's exactly the right amount of aggressive to win. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7803.839999999999s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7805.5199999999995s)]
*  He ain't coming at you like a fucking train, [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7807.28s)]
*  like Mike Tyson. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7809.24s)]
*  He's just chilling, chilling, chilling. [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7810.9800000000005s)]
*  All right, bow. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7812.42s)]
*  Yeah, but I mean, when people say that, [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7813.26s)]
*  they don't understand what the fuck they're talking about. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7815.82s)]
*  He's defensive, of course he is. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7817.78s)]
*  He's fighting Canelo Alvarez, of course he is. [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7819.26s)]
*  He's fighting the greatest boxers of all time. [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7822.42s)]
*  Of course he's defensive, you're supposed to be. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7825.06s)]
*  And he's a little man. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7827.26s)]
*  He's not big. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7829.22s)]
*  I wouldn't wanna get hit. [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7830.66s)]
*  You can always, I'm gonna be moving. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7832.22s)]
*  I'm gonna be, man, look, if I'm him, [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7833.5s)]
*  I'm in the best shape of my life. [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7835.66s)]
*  I'm moving around, you ain't ever gonna be able [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7837.26s)]
*  to catch me in that ring. [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7838.66s)]
*  I'm never gonna stand in front of your face. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7839.5s)]
*  We never gonna square up. [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7841.28s)]
*  I'm outta there. [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7842.8s)]
*  The thing that's crazy about Floyd is he does stand [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7843.64s)]
*  right in front of your face. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7845.8s)]
*  Yeah, he does. [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7846.64s)]
*  He stands right in front of your face [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7847.48s)]
*  and you still can't hit him. [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7848.3s)]
*  No, he's too smooth. That's what a wizard he is. [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7849.2s)]
*  He's too slick. [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7851.12s)]
*  Right, because a lot of people [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7852.16s)]
*  that are really good defensive fighters, [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7853.28s)]
*  like Willie Pepp, everybody always talks about Willie Pepp. [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7854.84s)]
*  And Willie Pepp was amazing. [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7856.76s)]
*  He won a round without even throwing a punch. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7857.76s)]
*  He won a round just with his defensive prowess. [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7860.56s)]
*  It was so impressive that he won the round. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7863.04s)]
*  The guy just couldn't touch him. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7864.48s)]
*  But Willie Pepp moved around a lot. [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7866.08s)]
*  He moved around his light on his feet, [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7868.700000000001s)]
*  whereas Floyd will stand right in front of you [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7871.06s)]
*  and he just like scoots just out of the way [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7872.740000000001s)]
*  and then he's right in front of you again. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7874.9800000000005s)]
*  He shoulder roll and you can't hit him. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7876.02s)]
*  You watch some of the videos of him [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7878.06s)]
*  when he fought Canelo. [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7879.820000000001s)]
*  It's so impressive. [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7880.66s)]
*  Canelo's just whiffing at the wind. [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7881.9400000000005s)]
*  He just can't catch him. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7883.900000000001s)]
*  And also, you think you can't [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7885.860000000001s)]
*  because he ain't got his gloves on his face. [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7888.860000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7890.58s)]
*  He's taunting you though. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7891.42s)]
*  I'm like, yo, he makes me nervous [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7894.3s)]
*  because I'm like, put your pants up. [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7895.92s)]
*  Put your fucking hands up. [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7897.58s)]
*  He knows what he's doing. [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7898.92s)]
*  I mean, it's just because he knows how to do it so well [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7900.08s)]
*  that he's luring people in to try to hit him. [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7903.08s)]
*  It looks like openings are there where they're not [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7905.12s)]
*  and then he counters you. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7907.24s)]
*  I like to watch Tank fight too. [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7908.4s)]
*  I can't wait for his next fight. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7910.3s)]
*  I think it's in April. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7911.36s)]
*  Well, that's the Ryan Davis fight, right? [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7912.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7913.92s)]
*  Ryan Garcia fight rather. [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7914.76s)]
*  I can't. [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7916.04s)]
*  That's a crazy fight. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7917.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7918.24s)]
*  That's an interesting fight. [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7919.08s)]
*  Tank is a monster. [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7920.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7921.2s)]
*  He's so different than anybody else [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7922.04s)]
*  because he doesn't throw a lot of punches. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7923.32s)]
*  No. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7925.08s)]
*  He measures you until he finds out where you're open [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7925.9s)]
*  and then once he finds out where you're open, you're fucked. [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7928.799999999999s)]
*  He just starts launching missiles your way. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7930.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I enjoyed his last fight too. [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7932.92s)]
*  Yeah, that was crazy. [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7935.04s)]
*  I thought that was gonna be a close one, but it wasn't. [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7936.46s)]
*  Well, it was close for a little bit [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7939.32s)]
*  because Tank fights like that. [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7940.5599999999995s)]
*  Because he leaves, he doesn't throw a lot of punches. [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7942.28s)]
*  He throws the least amount of punches [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7946.2s)]
*  in the early rounds of any of the champions. [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7948.839999999999s)]
*  But then once he figures you out, once he sizes you up, [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7950.9s)]
*  once he finds out where your holes are [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7953.66s)]
*  and he gets that timing in, [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7955.18s)]
*  it's like he's got a boxing computer in his brain. [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7956.38s)]
*  Okay, we got all the data. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7958.3s)]
*  Now this dude's starting to slow down. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7959.82s)]
*  Let's start putting it on him. [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7961.54s)]
*  And then he starts putting it on him. [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7962.38s)]
*  Yeah, and also with him, I like how humble he is as well. [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7964.26s)]
*  He's also like, I don't know how to describe it. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7970.26s)]
*  He's like this humble cocky man. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7972.9s)]
*  He knows that he can fight, but he ain't got to. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7974.46s)]
*  He's like one of those guys, he ain't gotta say it. [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7976.3s)]
*  Right. [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7978.0599999999995s)]
*  I would watch him in his interviews after the fight [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7979.3s)]
*  and he ain't saying, yeah, I told that motherfucker [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7981.66s)]
*  he ain't like that. [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7984.24s)]
*  What's next for you? [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7985.759999999999s)]
*  Well, I gotta get back in the gym. [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7986.599999999999s)]
*  I gotta fix all the mistakes I made. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7987.639999999999s)]
*  I gotta clean it up. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7989.32s)]
*  I ain't never gonna stop learning in this game. [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7990.44s)]
*  He ain't even stunting about making a man [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7993.12s)]
*  go blind in a ring. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7995.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7997.16s)]
*  So it's just like, I just like his swag. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=7998.0s)]
*  He's amazing. [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8001.16s)]
*  And there's a group of guys that are in his level right now, [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8002.36s)]
*  like Shakur Stevenson and this elite level. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8006.28s)]
*  And we're gonna find out with Ryan Garcia. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8011.5599999999995s)]
*  He's another one who's got, that guy's got like [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8013.86s)]
*  the fastest left hook I've ever seen. [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8015.0199999999995s)]
*  That's a very interesting fight. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8016.98s)]
*  I will say I'm nervous about that one for Tank, [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8018.78s)]
*  but like Tank say, he in the lab. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8022.94s)]
*  I'm pretty sure he figuring it out. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8025.78s)]
*  There's Devin Haney. [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8027.139999999999s)]
*  That division is just stacked with talent. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8028.62s)]
*  There's so much, boxing's a good spot right now. [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8031.58s)]
*  It's a fun time to be a fan. [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8033.86s)]
*  Yeah, I like it. [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8035.54s)]
*  I'm really, really, really, really digging it. [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8036.62s)]
*  That's why I do so. I'm glad you're doing it. [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8038.0599999999995s)]
*  I gotta do it, Joe. [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8039.78s)]
*  I've been wanting to do it for so long. [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8040.84s)]
*  I just, I don't, you know, and it's so crazy too [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8042.76s)]
*  because I thought that my hook would be, [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8044.92s)]
*  so my trainer basically told me I'm Southpaw. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8049.88s)]
*  I thought I was a right-handed boxer. [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8053.44s)]
*  He's like, no, you're a left-handed boxer. [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8056.12s)]
*  I was like, you don't. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8057.28s)]
*  Do you right with your left hand? [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8058.12s)]
*  Right with my left hand. [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8058.94s)]
*  You right with your left hand. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8059.78s)]
*  I do everything with my left hand, but. [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8060.62s)]
*  Do you fight with your left hand forward [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8061.92s)]
*  or your right hand forward? [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8063.5599999999995s)]
*  My right hand forward. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8064.44s)]
*  Okay, so you fight Southpaw. [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8065.6s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8066.84s)]
*  So I thought that my right hand was the strongest. [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8068.24s)]
*  That's what I thought, but my left hand is the strongest. [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8074.7s)]
*  But I gotta kill a right hook though too. [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8077.34s)]
*  But my left hook sucks. [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8079.62s)]
*  But it's all in my balance. [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8081.82s)]
*  He say, but your power is your two. [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8084.34s)]
*  Right, your straight left. [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8086.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8087.46s)]
*  So, cause I was like, no, no, no, no. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8088.3s)]
*  I was like, my power is my right hand. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8091.62s)]
*  He say, no, it's your left hand. [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8094.54s)]
*  So we got in a fight. [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8095.82s)]
*  So he was like, so he came charging at me. [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8097.26s)]
*  And as he was charging at me, I did this to him. [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8100.42s)]
*  He was like, you Southpaw. [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8103.04s)]
*  If you woulda did this, then you woulda been. [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8104.76s)]
*  Right, because you were trying to set him up [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8107.62s)]
*  for a big left hand. [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8108.860000000001s)]
*  Right, I stopped him with that. [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8109.820000000001s)]
*  He say, that is your jab hand. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8111.2s)]
*  That's how I know your power coming from here. [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8112.8s)]
*  We know a lot of fighters, they would fight Southpaw, [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8114.76s)]
*  even though they were right handed. [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8117.24s)]
*  That was Oscar De La Hoya. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8118.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8119.52s)]
*  He's right handed, but he fights Southpaw. [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8120.360000000001s)]
*  So his strong hand would be forward. [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8121.280000000001s)]
*  Okay, okay. [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8122.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, there's different schools of thought on that. [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8123.84s)]
*  So Emanuel Stewart did that with a lot of people. [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8125.780000000001s)]
*  He took guys that were natural right handed [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8127.860000000001s)]
*  and he put them in a Southpaw stance. [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8130.280000000001s)]
*  Because also if you're learning from a Southpaw stance, [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8131.96s)]
*  you have an advantage that most people fight orthodox. [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8134.780000000001s)]
*  So when you're fighting, it gives people a very, [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8137.58s)]
*  when you fight someone who's a Southpaw, [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8140.58s)]
*  it's confusing when you're boxing. [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8142.58s)]
*  Because everything's backwards. [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8144.3s)]
*  So if you're not used to it, [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8145.8s)]
*  like in the early days of boxing, [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8146.900000000001s)]
*  but then the best guys are guys like Terrence Crawford, [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8148.72s)]
*  who could just switch, or Boots Ennis, who just switch. [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8150.780000000001s)]
*  They just switch. [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8153.68s)]
*  They could fight Southpaw, they could fight you orthodox. [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8154.88s)]
*  You're like, oh Jesus. [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8156.88s)]
*  Like you don't know where the fuck punches are coming from. [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8157.92s)]
*  They're coming from everywhere. [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8159.92s)]
*  Yeah, that's why you gotta learn how to stick and move. [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8161.24s)]
*  Get out of there. [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8163.12s)]
*  But back in the day, that was really rare. [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8163.96s)]
*  Like Marvin Hagler was the great at that. [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8165.12s)]
*  He was like the most famous of all. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8166.96s)]
*  Who was it, Marvin? [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8169.32s)]
*  Marvin Hagler. [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8170.28s)]
*  Marvelous Marvin Hagler. [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8171.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, he was the middleweight champion. [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8173.0s)]
*  He knocked out Tommy Hearns. [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8174.16s)]
*  And I mean, Hagler in his time was a destroyer. [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8175.719999999999s)]
*  And Hagler would fight, he would switch it up all the time. [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8179.5599999999995s)]
*  He'd fight orthodox, he'd fight Southpaw. [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8182.36s)]
*  He can go back and forth. [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8184.06s)]
*  He would throw a punch and switch stances. [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8184.9s)]
*  It was a totally, it was very rare in Hagler's day [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8186.82s)]
*  that an elite world champion would switch stances [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8190.42s)]
*  so effortlessly. [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8193.3s)]
*  But now you got like Terrence Crawford does it. [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8194.74s)]
*  Like I said, Boots Ennis does it. [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8196.5s)]
*  I don't, I ain't gonna say I can't do it. [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8198.46s)]
*  I'm saying I never have, but I might. [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8200.58s)]
*  It's a good thing to learn. [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8202.14s)]
*  If you can learn how to do things from your left side, [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8203.3s)]
*  it actually shows you how to do things better [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8205.62s)]
*  from your right side, weirdly enough. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8207.26s)]
*  It actually helps you. [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8209.42s)]
*  I'm still learning how to write with my right hand. [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8210.46s)]
*  I can't even hold this. [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8213.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8215.24s)]
*  I broke my arm once and I had to do that. [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8216.76s)]
*  I had to learn how to write and draw with my left hand. [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8218.279999999999s)]
*  I mean, I think I can, but it's gonna be, it's awful. [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8220.84s)]
*  You can, but you have to teach your hand how to do it, [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8224.64s)]
*  which is so interesting. [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8227.039999999999s)]
*  Because you would think if your left hand does it so well, [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8228.32s)]
*  your right hand would just, [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8230.08s)]
*  you would just tell your right hand to do it. [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8230.96s)]
*  But my left hand's stupid. [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8232.84s)]
*  It just doesn't listen good. [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8234.84s)]
*  My right hand's like. [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8235.9s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8237.32s)]
*  I kinda like being left handed though. [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8238.519999999999s)]
*  It's like, you know, crazily, when I was growing up, [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8240.52s)]
*  I got bullied for being left handed. [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8244.26s)]
*  A lot of people do. [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8246.74s)]
*  You know, it's like I was the weird one. [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8247.78s)]
*  They used to think it was satanic. [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8250.02s)]
*  Yeah, it's just like. [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8252.74s)]
*  They would tell left handed people [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8254.74s)]
*  to not use their left hand back in the day. [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8256.220000000001s)]
*  Now, I heard about that, but when I was in school, [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8259.86s)]
*  they didn't do that to me. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8262.140000000001s)]
*  But the kids would bully me. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8262.98s)]
*  For being left handed. [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8264.5s)]
*  For being, yes. [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8265.34s)]
*  That's so stupid. [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8266.54s)]
*  And for having duck feet. [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8267.380000000001s)]
*  Do you know I look goofy? [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8269.279999999999s)]
*  Cause I hate boxing sometimes and watching myself [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8270.24s)]
*  cause I'm so goofy. [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8272.599999999999s)]
*  My feet are duck feet. [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8274.099999999999s)]
*  So. [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8275.84s)]
*  They just play out. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8276.679999999998s)]
*  Yes, and I can't get them. [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8277.5s)]
*  You know, I'm trying to get them to stay straight. [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8278.88s)]
*  But when I, you know, I know what happened. [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8280.98s)]
*  I always had duck feet, [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8283.08s)]
*  but I look so goofy when I'm boxing [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8284.199999999999s)]
*  because I hurt my niece playing soccer [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8285.539999999999s)]
*  when I was in college. [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8288.64s)]

*  And I went to do a power kick and this person blocked me. [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8293.92s)]
*  So my body went one way and my leg [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8297.24s)]
*  went the other way and I messed my knee up. [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8299.48s)]
*  So I just look goofy when I'm boxing. [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8300.24s)]
*  But I might can use that as an advantage. [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8303.56s)]
*  Think about like, look at this goofy footed bitch. [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8307.44s)]
*  Then I get in there and I'll whack somebody. [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8309.64s)]

*  One of the most vicious one punch KO in women's boxing. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8463.56s)]
*  Look at that. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8466.58s)]

*  with the wrong lady. [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8474.5s)]

*  one punch KO power. [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8478.02s)]
*  James Kirkland, that's who it was. [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8480.56s)]
*  And who eventually went on to fight Canelo, but watch this. [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8482.6s)]
*  Look at them arms, oh my God. [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8485.8s)]
*  But it's also the skill. [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8487.2s)]
*  She's setting up this overhand right. [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8488.36s)]
*  Looking at her dead eyes. [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8490.9s)]
*  Measure, measure. [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8494.32s)]
*  And then she comes forward, too predictably. [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8495.88s)]
*  Boom. [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8498.36s)]

*  Because my problem is, I start doing too much arm work, [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8512.62s)]
*  I'll get jacked. [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8516.34s)]
*  Yeah? [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8517.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8518.26s)]
*  Jacked, hard jacked. [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8519.08s)]
*  That's why I keep my hair. [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8519.92s)]
*  Because if I cut it all off, I'm gonna look like a man. [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8521.34s)]
*  I was like, I don't want to look that. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8526.140000000001s)]
*  Because I had to chill out for a second. [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8529.02s)]
*  Because I don't want to get that jacked. [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8531.720000000001s)]
*  I still want to be a little cute. [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8533.08s)]
*  Well that's world championship jacked. [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8534.400000000001s)]
*  That's a different thing. [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8536.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, that's like months and months of training camp. [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8537.240000000002s)]
*  Jesus. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8539.480000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8540.320000000002s)]
*  Anne Wolfe. [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8541.28s)]
*  Yeah, I watched her a lot. [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8542.400000000001s)]
*  And she was one of the rare female boxers [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8544.16s)]
*  that had so many guys' respect that she was training men. [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8547.480000000001s)]
*  A lot of men. [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8551.76s)]
*  The men that were willing to do her routine. [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8554.04s)]
*  But the thing is, Kirkland, I don't think he wanted to do [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8556.28s)]
*  what she wanted him to do. [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8559.12s)]
*  They split up. [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8560.86s)]
*  Then he went up losing to Canelo. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8561.82s)]
*  She would drive. [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8563.26s)]
*  See if you can find Anne Wolfe's strength [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8565.26s)]
*  in conditioning James Kirkland. [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8567.38s)]
*  I gotta get to LA. [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8571.22s)]
*  Because there was these strength in training routines [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8572.06s)]
*  that she would put fighters through. [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8575.619999999999s)]
*  They did not want to do what she wanted them to do. [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8577.5s)]
*  She would break you. [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8579.94s)]
*  Her camps were notoriously brutal. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8581.46s)]
*  Good. [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8584.06s)]
*  Yeah, well that's how you become a champion. [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8584.9s)]
*  That was it. [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8586.619999999999s)]
*  She had a no tolerance for bullshit policy [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8587.6s)]
*  when it came to training. [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8591.24s)]
*  I wanna adapt this lady, Coach Cam, out in Los Angeles. [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8592.68s)]
*  I wanna go train with her. [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8596.52s)]
*  She's training James Kirkland. [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8598.28s)]
*  And you know. [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8603.24s)]
*  Whoa, terrible sound. [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8604.64s)]
*  So Kirkland at one point in time [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8606.28s)]
*  was a top flight professional. [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8607.68s)]
*  And she was his trainer. [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8609.84s)]
*  Wow. [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8611.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8612.76s)]
*  Kirkland was a beast. [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8613.72s)]
*  He was like the recipient of one of Canelo's [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8614.98s)]
*  most impressive KO's. [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8618.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8620.300000000001s)]
*  And that was the camp that he didn't work with Anne Wolfe. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8621.14s)]
*  It was just brutal. [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8625.22s)]
*  It was a brutal KO. [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8626.18s)]
*  But it was also Canelo. [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8627.02s)]
*  I mean Canelo was one of the greatest of all time. [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8628.380000000001s)]
*  I was upset he lost his last fight. [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8630.22s)]
*  Against Demetri Bival. [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8632.5s)]
*  Well he won his last fight. [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8633.5s)]
*  It was triple G. [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8634.78s)]
*  But the Bival fight, Bival's another weight class. [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8635.7s)]
*  I mean Canelo's a psycho. [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8639.18s)]
*  Just the fact that he decided to go up to 175 [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8640.98s)]
*  and fight the best at 175. [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8643.46s)]
*  Fight one of the champions. [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8646.279999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's a crazy fight. [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8648.72s)]
*  They're doing a rematch. [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8649.96s)]
*  Good. [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8651.039999999999s)]
*  I think that's taking place in April. [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8651.88s)]
*  Is that what it is? [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8654.16s)]
*  The Canelo rematch? [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8655.0s)]
*  That'd be good. [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8657.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8658.24s)]
*  I can't wait for that one. [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8659.06s)]
*  Is that what it is? [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8660.519999999999s)]
*  They should do that in Cinco de Mayo. [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8661.519999999999s)]

*  who's ever done those psychedelics. [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8888.82s)]
*  Right. [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8890.619999999999s)]
*  Which is really a wild way of thinking about it. [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8891.46s)]
*  Because if that is the case, [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8893.5s)]
*  that maybe applies to alcohol as well. [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8895.06s)]
*  And if it does apply to alcohol, [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8898.22s)]
*  and that this thing that you're drinking, [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8899.779999999999s)]

*  or vodka, or whiskey, which would make sense [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8911.04s)]
*  with why people get wild with whiskey. [[02:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8914.2s)]
*  If you think about all the Kentucky bourbon [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8916.24s)]
*  that was made in this country [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8917.84s)]

*  You're gonna wake up in the middle [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8941.619999999999s)]
*  of a shootout with the cops. [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8942.9s)]
*  I am a fucking sociopath on fucking moonshine. [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8944.3s)]
*  I had to stop drinking moonshine almost, [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8948.26s)]
*  like I'm divorced now, but I almost lost my wife [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8950.58s)]
*  when I was married when I was drinking moonshine. [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8953.94s)]
*  I don't know why, I would just get fucking naked in public. [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8955.74s)]
*  What if that's it? [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8958.42s)]
*  What if that really is it? [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8959.64s)]
*  What if, like when you take in a substance, [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8960.76s)]
*  you're not just taking in that substance, [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8963.28s)]
*  but you're taking in the body of all the other people [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8965.199999999999s)]
*  that have had that experience on that substance, [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8967.76s)]
*  and you're sharing some weird vibe. [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8970.039999999999s)]
*  It's a crazy way of looking at it. [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8973.24s)]
*  I know, I mean, I'm considering that it can be a factor. [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8974.08s)]
*  I'm thinking about it now for the first time. [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8978.64s)]
*  I've thought about it before with mushrooms, [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8980.119999999999s)]
*  and I've thought about it before with psychedelics. [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8982.44s)]
*  I think there might be something to that. [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8984.16s)]
*  Because psychedelics are so weird, [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8986.24s)]
*  like when you're doing them, like maybe I am, [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8987.72s)]
*  maybe that is part of what's going on here. [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8989.42s)]
*  Maybe everyone who's ever had this experience, [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8991.42s)]
*  like leaves something in there, [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8995.22s)]
*  or you experience something with them. [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8997.18s)]
*  I do wanna try ayahuasca. [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=8999.74s)]
*  I'm scared of it. [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9001.699999999999s)]
*  I'm very, very, I don't like when I can't control [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9002.98s)]
*  what I'm doing, and I feel like that's something [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9006.26s)]
*  that you can't control, because I've heard people [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9008.06s)]
*  that's done it, and afterwards they love it, [[02:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9010.06s)]
*  but while they're dealing with it and going through it, [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9012.699999999999s)]
*  they can't control what's happening to them. [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9015.22s)]
*  No, you can't control the trip. [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9017.14s)]
*  You can't control DMT. [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9019.2s)]
*  You can't control mushrooms either. [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9020.44s)]
*  And when you try to, that's when you have the bad trips. [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9022.04s)]
*  I wanna do it so much, because I feel like just [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9026.28s)]
*  when you cross over to the other side of that, [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9028.800000000001s)]
*  it's just this peace, this inner peace [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9031.720000000001s)]
*  that you have within yourself, [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9034.36s)]
*  that I think it might be worth it to do it. [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9036.52s)]
*  Maybe what if you do it and you don't want to box anymore? [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9041.68s)]
*  So about love to punky. [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9044.92s)]
*  No, first of all, no. [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9046.54s)]
*  No peace and love. [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9047.7s)]
*  No, I don't want, if that's the case, [[02:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9048.54s)]
*  I ain't never doing that shit, [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9051.54s)]
*  because I gotta knock somebody the fuck out. [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9052.66s)]
*  But I just, oh man. [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9057.5s)]
*  I'm scared, Joe. [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9061.460000000001s)]
*  You ever done it? [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9062.460000000001s)]
*  I have not done Ayahuasca. [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9063.460000000001s)]
*  I've only done DMT, but I'm scheduled to do it. [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9065.140000000001s)]
*  Really? [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9067.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9068.26s)]
*  Soon? [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9069.08s)]
*  Are you gonna film it? [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9070.58s)]
*  No. [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9071.66s)]
*  Somebody asked me to do something like that with mushrooms. [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9072.5s)]
*  That's not a thing you should do. [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9075.800000000001s)]
*  Well, for yourself, because I don't want to see me trip. [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9077.76s)]
*  But you don't even want to know a camera's there. [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9080.48s)]
*  You don't want to be thinking about any other thing. [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9083.48s)]
*  Oh yeah, true that. [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9084.76s)]
*  You want to get the most out of the experience, [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9085.6s)]
*  at least me personally, and I feel like [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9088.2s)]
*  if you're filming it, you're gonna be aware [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9090.28s)]
*  that there's cameras. [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9092.16s)]
*  It's like, there's an element. [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9093.16s)]
*  Part of psychedelics that's very important is set and setting. [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9095.68s)]
*  Some people think that whenever you take [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9101.16s)]
*  certain psychedelics, like sacred psychedelics, [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9103.82s)]
*  like psilocybin for instance, [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9106.68s)]
*  you should have a very peaceful setting [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9108.279999999999s)]
*  and you should set it up correctly [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9111.68s)]
*  and you should also get your mind [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9113.6s)]
*  into a good place before you do it. [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9115.24s)]
*  Maybe do some yoga, don't eat anything, [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9117.0s)]
*  get your mind right, calm yourself down, [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9119.94s)]
*  maybe meditate and prepare yourself. [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9121.88s)]
*  Correct. [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9123.76s)]
*  You're going for a wild ride. [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9124.6s)]
*  You gotta be ready to just relinquish control of the reins. [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9126.32s)]
*  Maybe I'll try mushrooms again. [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9130.52s)]
*  I did mushrooms once, I was like, [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9131.84s)]
*  no I'm not doing it. [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9133.58s)]
*  What happened? [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9134.42s)]
*  I couldn't see color. [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9135.74s)]
*  Everything was one color and it didn't matter [[02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9142.62s)]
*  what I did to my eyes, it didn't matter [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9146.02s)]
*  how much I blanked them, how long I kept them closed [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9147.5s)]
*  and opened them. [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9150.34s)]
*  What color was it? [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9151.34s)]
*  How long I slapped, red, how long I slapped my face. [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9152.18s)]
*  So you were seeing red. [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9154.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9155.98s)]
*  Literally seeing red. [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9156.82s)]
*  Yes, it was like a screen. [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9157.74s)]
*  So instead of black and white, it was like black and red? [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9159.7s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9162.480000000001s)]
*  So you could see objects? [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9163.68s)]
*  I saw everything, but everything was red. [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9165.740000000002s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9168.16s)]
*  And I'm just like, nah, I'm good. [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9169.0s)]
*  How long did that last? [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9171.36s)]
*  A couple hours, it was a couple hours. [[02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9173.84s)]
*  What else happened? [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9177.240000000002s)]
*  It wasn't like 24 hours, but it was just a couple hours. [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9178.08s)]
*  That's why I don't ever want to try and ask it [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9181.2s)]
*  because I heard that that's like a 24 hour trip. [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9182.640000000001s)]
*  Supposedly can be. [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9185.26s)]
*  Yeah, I don't wanna, I'm never took on a, no. [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9186.640000000001s)]
*  I've heard stories of people thinking they're drowning. [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9190.6s)]
*  I'm like, fuck that. [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9192.44s)]
*  Cause if you think you're drowning motherfucker, [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9195.240000000002s)]
*  you're drowning. [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9196.6s)]
*  I ain't doing that. [[02:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9198.400000000001s)]
*  So nah. [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9200.02s)]
*  I just don't ever wanna be in a position to where, [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9203.980000000001s)]
*  like I saw this movie and this guy controlled, [[02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9206.220000000001s)]
*  like if you cross this guy the wrong way, [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9210.480000000001s)]
*  I think it was called hypnotist or something. [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9212.16s)]
*  If you cross this guy the wrong way, [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9214.480000000001s)]
*  he would hypnotize you and make you think [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9216.28s)]
*  that you are in a stressful situation and you could die. [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9220.66s)]
*  Like this one woman, the walls were closing in on her. [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9223.800000000001s)]
*  She was rude to him, I made him mad. [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9226.94s)]
*  And the walls were closing in on her, in her mind, [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9228.58s)]
*  but they weren't. [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9232.18s)]
*  And she fucking had a heart attack and died. [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9233.78s)]
*  And I feel like sometimes a drug can do that to you [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9236.900000000001s)]
*  and I'm not trying to go out like that. [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9239.1s)]

*  but we gave him a worse concussion [[02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9548.32s)]
*  because that dead weight was so heavy. [[02:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-jA_KpH46s&t=9549.96s)]
