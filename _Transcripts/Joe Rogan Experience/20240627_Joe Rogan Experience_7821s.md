# Joe Rogan Experience #1902 - Danny Brown
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6.0s)]
*  But then you thinkin' like that, Des. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=10.0s)]
*  That's the curse of being successful though, right? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=15.0s)]
*  Like people lean on you. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=18.0s)]
*  I'm successful, but on my own terms. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=20.0s)]
*  Yeah, but that's still successful. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=22.0s)]
*  Yeah, but on your own terms is great. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=25.0s)]
*  Because, see, my shit was the music industry. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=28.0s)]
*  And the music industry is one of those type of situations where [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=30.0s)]
*  you can be as creative as you want to be, but does that make you money? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=33.0s)]
*  You know? So you have this whole fuckin' like angel and double on your shoulder. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=37.0s)]
*  Like, make a hit song. Or be creative as you want to be. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=43.0s)]
*  Do what you want to do, or do what you think is gonna sell. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=47.0s)]
*  In my whole entire career, I just did what I wanted to do. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=50.0s)]
*  And, but at this point, after ten years, I sit back sometime and I think about like, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=53.0s)]
*  damn, did I make a mistake? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=58.0s)]
*  Because, you know, there's still a lot of people in my family that struggle. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=60.0s)]
*  And it's like, fuck. You know? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=63.0s)]
*  But if I just didn't care about being Danny Brown and being so cool [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=65.0s)]
*  and trying to make the most experimental music I could possibly make, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=69.0s)]
*  fuckin' just, don't give a fuck. Make that fuckin' hit song. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=72.0s)]
*  But isn't that you though? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=76.0s)]
*  But I can do it. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=78.0s)]
*  You could do both. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=79.0s)]
*  That's the whole thing of what makes you a great artist. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=81.0s)]
*  See, like a person like Jay-Z, he does both. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=83.0s)]
*  Yes. Does both. Yeah. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=85.0s)]
*  I don't know if I can do both because it's such a drastic, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=87.0s)]
*  it's such a drastic change from what I love as underground music [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=89.0s)]
*  and what is commercially considered to be pop music. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=94.0s)]
*  It's such a drastic, it's such a fuckin', you know what I'm sayin'? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=98.0s)]
*  So I don't know if I can ever make it. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=101.0s)]
*  It's like, with Patrice O'Neil. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=103.0s)]
*  Would he ever been a fuckin', you know what I'm sayin'? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=107.0s)]
*  Commercial, like stand-up con. You know what I'm sayin'? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=110.0s)]
*  No, I think he would have been. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=112.0s)]
*  At this point in age? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=114.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. We would have forced it through. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=115.0s)]
*  He would have made it. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=117.0s)]
*  That's the one person that I look up to. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=118.0s)]
*  He was amazing. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=120.0s)]
*  I look up to him so much. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=121.0s)]
*  Everybody would have forced it through. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=123.0s)]
*  Like, even if he couldn't get on a television show, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=125.0s)]
*  even if nothing ever happened for him like that, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=128.0s)]
*  we would have all had him on podcasts. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=130.0s)]
*  Because even with my rap career and just how I look at making music, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=132.0s)]
*  I look at him as like a super inspiration. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=135.0s)]
*  Like, it was my last album, which was called You Know What I'm Saying, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=137.0s)]
*  which is actually from Time and Christina, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=141.0s)]
*  because they had this bit. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=144.0s)]
*  But they had this bit where they had niggas, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=146.0s)]
*  and you know what niggas be like, you know what I'm sayin'? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=148.0s)]
*  Even me, I say you know what I'm sayin' like a lot. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=150.0s)]
*  But before that, the name of the album was the Patrice O'Neil theory. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=152.0s)]
*  Oh. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=155.0s)]
*  Because Patrice O'Neil, he had this theory where he talked about like, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=157.0s)]
*  men has periods. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=160.0s)]
*  But we don't necessarily have periods. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=162.0s)]
*  We just want to fuck another bitch. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=164.0s)]
*  So every time you mad at your girl, like, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=166.0s)]
*  she like all on you, and she like, uh, you like, uh. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=169.0s)]
*  My woman is beautiful, you know what I'm sayin'? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=173.0s)]
*  But you like, bitch, you just want another taste of something. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=176.0s)]
*  You get what I'm sayin'? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=182.0s)]
*  You get that, like, it's to the point where if you've been so faithful for so long, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=184.0s)]
*  you're like, I'll fuck a homeless bitch on the corner at this point. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=188.0s)]
*  You get what I'm sayin'? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=190.0s)]
*  But if I did, it's gonna make me love you so much more. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=192.0s)]
*  Like, I won't have this attitude with you, this whole attitude I got with you. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=196.0s)]
*  You think, why are you so mad? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=199.0s)]
*  Why are you actin' like this? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=201.0s)]
*  Because I need some new pussy. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=203.0s)]
*  And that's all that is. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=205.0s)]
*  The Patrice O'Neil theory. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=207.0s)]
*  That's the Patrice O'Neil theory. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=209.0s)]
*  He had a lot of great theories. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=210.0s)]
*  But I would say, listen, I'm gonna say this because I love my girl at home. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=211.0s)]
*  I know she probably listened to this. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=213.0s)]
*  I love you, baby. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=214.0s)]
*  I'm out of that. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=216.0s)]
*  I don't have that. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=218.0s)]
*  Don't get hurt like that. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=220.0s)]
*  I'm 40 years old. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=222.0s)]
*  This motherfucker's been burnt out. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=224.0s)]
*  They've been hitting this motherfucker. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=226.0s)]
*  This bitch been speed bagging this dick. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=228.0s)]
*  This dick been getting speed bagged for the last 10 years. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=230.0s)]
*  When did you decide to do this podcast that you're doing with your mom's house? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=234.0s)]
*  Because it's hilarious. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=238.0s)]
*  No, the thing was that, oh, you know, Uncle Joey. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=240.0s)]
*  Like, it started with... [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=244.0s)]
*  He started? Like you and him doing a podcast thing? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=246.0s)]
*  No, you want me to bring it? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=248.0s)]
*  Because it goes back into me just being a rapper. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=250.0s)]
*  And just me being on some rap shit. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=252.0s)]
*  And I was on tour. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=254.0s)]
*  I was on tour for a long part of time. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=256.0s)]
*  And being on tour, you get bored. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=258.0s)]
*  And I'm a gamer. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=260.0s)]
*  So I buy a lot of video games. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=262.0s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=264.0s)]
*  I bought UFC. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=266.0s)]
*  Before the good UFCs. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=268.0s)]
*  This is a whatever UFC video game. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=270.0s)]
*  And I was the fucking announcer on it. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=272.0s)]
*  So I'm playing that. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=274.0s)]
*  And you're the announcer on the album tour. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=276.0s)]
*  And then I guess, I don't know, some type of way I was watching UFC or some shit. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=278.0s)]
*  And then I seen you on there. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=282.0s)]
*  And it was like, oh, this the nigga from the video game. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=284.0s)]
*  Is this not hilarious to you? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=286.0s)]
*  Like this is how I got up on this whole shit. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=288.0s)]
*  So I'm like, this the nigga from the video game. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=290.0s)]
*  Joe Rogan. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=292.0s)]
*  So then I started listening to Joe Rogan shit. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=294.0s)]
*  And then from seeing Joe Rogan shit, I seen Uncle Joey on there. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=296.0s)]
*  And I say Uncle Joe Rogan. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=298.0s)]
*  And I see Uncle Joey on there. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=300.0s)]
*  And I see that. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=302.0s)]
*  And I just start going through the fucking rabbit hole of your shit. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=304.0s)]
*  Like even the shit of fucking Red Band dumbass always talking about fucking Olive Garden and shit like that. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=306.0s)]
*  Like the fucking like. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=314.0s)]
*  Olive Garden and butthole. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=316.0s)]
*  Yeah, like the Justin TV. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=318.0s)]
*  So I've been, like I will credit you to fucking up my fucking music career in some sense. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=320.0s)]
*  I will say that. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=326.0s)]
*  All I did was all I ever did in my life was listen to music. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=328.0s)]
*  Like I was one of those people where I would like be like, man, people don't really listen to music. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=330.0s)]
*  They just listen to music in their cars or when they got a function. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=336.0s)]
*  I'm the type of person that listens to music 24 7's a day. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=340.0s)]
*  Whatever new. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=344.0s)]
*  But then I started getting into podcasting. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=346.0s)]
*  And listening to your shit. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=348.0s)]
*  And doing that. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=350.0s)]
*  So I'm just being into podcasting and listening to your shit. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=352.0s)]
*  And then I started to like, you know, fucking with Uncle Joey and all that shit. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=356.0s)]
*  And then I got into YMADE shit. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=358.0s)]
*  Listening to their shit. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=360.0s)]
*  And then, you know, just time hit me up. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=362.0s)]
*  Like come through. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=364.0s)]
*  But when time hit me up, he didn't know how much of a fanboy I was or the shit. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=366.0s)]
*  So when I came through, I was hitting them with all this shit. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=368.0s)]
*  You know, all the fucking YMADE shit. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=372.0s)]
*  Like, you know, straight real mommy shit. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=374.0s)]
*  You get what I'm saying? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=376.0s)]
*  Genes. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=378.0s)]
*  Yeah, so the genes. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=380.0s)]
*  So that's what happened. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=382.0s)]
*  And then when I came through, I was like reeling the shit. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=384.0s)]
*  So they embraced me with that shit. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=386.0s)]
*  So time would always hit me up and talk about it. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=388.0s)]
*  He'd be like, man. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=390.0s)]
*  Because me and time were like FaceTime and like talk to each other. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=392.0s)]
*  Some real friendship. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=394.0s)]
*  And he had nothing to do with no business or nothing else. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=396.0s)]
*  And time was like, man, you should do a podcast. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=398.0s)]
*  I'm telling you, you'll be good at doing podcasts. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=400.0s)]
*  I'm glad he told you that. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=402.0s)]
*  And this and that. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=404.0s)]
*  But my whole shit was with him. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=406.0s)]
*  And I was like, man, no. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=408.0s)]
*  Being good at podcasts is good. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=410.0s)]
*  I was like, man, I'm gonna be good at talking shit in front of the camera. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=412.0s)]
*  And the fucking microphone in my bedroom. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=414.0s)]
*  And start talking shit in front of the camera. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=416.0s)]
*  But is that gonna be good? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=418.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=420.0s)]
*  Danny, it would be good. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=422.0s)]
*  But I was like, no. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=424.0s)]
*  Listen, all of it's good. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=426.0s)]
*  It just captures you. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=428.0s)]
*  It's nice to have great production. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=430.0s)]
*  And the way they do it at your mom's house is awesome. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=432.0s)]
*  You have like a real professional studio. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=434.0s)]
*  I went over there and visited. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=436.0s)]
*  It's beautiful. The whole setup is beautiful. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=438.0s)]
*  You're just good at it. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=440.0s)]
*  Because you're a fan of podcasts for so long, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=442.0s)]
*  I think you're probably talking back in your head. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=444.0s)]
*  Yeah, like it gotta be big. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=446.0s)]
*  It gotta look professional. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=448.0s)]
*  It can't be fucked. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=450.0s)]
*  But see, this is the double-edged sword with that with me. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=452.0s)]
*  Because what I loved about podcasting was like, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=454.0s)]
*  I was almost like a fly on the wall against seeing friends just hanging out drinking and talking shit. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=456.0s)]
*  And now when you watch podcasts and it's so fucking overproduced, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=464.0s)]
*  I heard that these niggas is writing scripts now. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=468.0s)]
*  No. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=470.0s)]
*  I swear I heard some shit like that. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=472.0s)]
*  Where they said these niggas got scripts [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=474.0s)]
*  and they looking at them on a trailer prompter [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=476.0s)]
*  and they sitting there doing podcasts. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=478.0s)]
*  They doing scripted podcasts. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=480.0s)]
*  Podcasts is supposed to be like you just a fly on the wall sitting there in the room with a couple friends. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=482.0s)]
*  And you hearing them talking shit and you like, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=488.0s)]
*  that's why we love fucking Brogan so much. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=490.0s)]
*  You get what I'm saying? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=492.0s)]
*  Now, this some real shit. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=494.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=496.0s)]
*  But in the beginning, it says this shit like no, we're flying a wall. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=498.0s)]
*  But the point of that that has turned to what media is in real life now. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=500.0s)]
*  It makes so much sense when you got fucking, we went through reality TV so much. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=506.0s)]
*  Now, motherfuckers that play video games watch other motherfuckers that play video games. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=512.0s)]
*  For fun. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=518.0s)]
*  You get what I'm saying? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=520.0s)]
*  I remember a time ago about a cameraman from a reality TV show getting his own reality TV show. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=522.0s)]
*  So the reality TV show was about a cameraman following around a cameraman on a reality TV show. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=528.0s)]
*  And then I go, but then people are going to go, well, what about the cameraman behind the cameraman? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=536.0s)]
*  And then they're going to do a cameraman show on that. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=540.0s)]
*  I would love to see, me and my fucked up brain, I would love to see that show, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=544.0s)]
*  but it had to be like the niggas that shoot porn though. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=546.0s)]
*  I want to know about the porn cameraman. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=548.0s)]
*  Porn cameraman? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=552.0s)]
*  He a little creepy too. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=554.0s)]
*  How you get that job? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=556.0s)]
*  You just looking for it? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=558.0s)]
*  Because I feel like a cameraman is such a vast. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=560.0s)]
*  You shooting for the NBA or you shooting for the motherfucking anal projections. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=562.0s)]
*  You get what I'm saying? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=568.0s)]
*  So you picking your poison. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=570.0s)]
*  Yeah, you could be a professional and work for both. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=572.0s)]
*  I mean, no, at the end of the day, what I will say that's good about the cameraman shit is that [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=574.0s)]
*  just like everything else with DJing, everything that comes with the internet, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=582.0s)]
*  everything or even like production equipment, all this shit has become so easy to use. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=586.0s)]
*  Back in the day, it wasn't really like I couldn't go on YouTube and find an instruction manual to how to use an MPC. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=592.0s)]
*  You know, Jamie's an audio engineer, like a real audio engineer who went to school for it. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=600.0s)]
*  Yeah, I had to go to school. There was no YouTube for it. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=603.0s)]
*  And then like the year I graduated, YouTube got invented. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=605.0s)]
*  And you just learn audio on YouTube. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=608.0s)]
*  How much of what you learned in school is still valid? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=610.0s)]
*  It's hard to say because a lot of there's even some of the computer programs, they don't edit for you, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=615.0s)]
*  but they handle a lot of the shit that's that was difficult. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=621.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=625.0s)]
*  The only thing that I think about is that it's better in this sense. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=626.0s)]
*  Because you get a lot of different point of views. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=630.0s)]
*  Like if I'm a nigga, I'm trying to learn some shit on YouTube. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=633.0s)]
*  It's a topic that has a lot of different people that's talking about it. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=636.0s)]
*  I'm taking the best parts of or whatever identifies with me. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=640.0s)]
*  I'm like, oh, I'm figuring that shit out and do it like that instead of just learning from one person. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=645.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=649.0s)]
*  Oh, you know, I just started I've joined a Muay Thai gym. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=650.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=654.0s)]

*  Everybody sucks in the beginning. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=666.0s)]
*  No, I'm chilling out right now. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=667.0s)]
*  I'm not. I'll probably go back in a few months. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=671.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=673.0s)]
*  But you were doing it? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=674.0s)]
*  No, I've been three, four months hard. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=675.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=678.0s)]
*  It's good for you, man. It's great to get tension out, too. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=680.0s)]
*  Yeah. But it's one of those things, you know. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=683.0s)]
*  Yeah. But I didn't know that part because I was doing privates. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=685.0s)]
*  Yeah. And that was fun. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=689.0s)]
*  You know, learning shit. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=690.0s)]
*  Privates are good. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=692.0s)]
*  Then I was like, you know what? Let me go to real class and start going to real class. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=693.0s)]
*  I went sparring with people and shit? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=696.0s)]

*  But I guess I'm talking about it. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=718.0s)]

*  I think he felt, he was like, you know what that made me feel like? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=768.0s)]
*  It was like when a nigga suck at basketball, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=772.0s)]
*  and then he show up with the whole Jordan fit on, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=775.0s)]
*  with the drawers and the iris and sleeve and all that. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=777.0s)]
*  So I felt like that's what Muay Thai was looking at me like at that point. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=780.0s)]
*  But I didn't have no Muay Thai clothes. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=783.0s)]
*  So this is my first time buying some Muay Thai shit. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=785.0s)]
*  I'm an ill nigga. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=787.0s)]
*  I love fashion. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=788.0s)]
*  So I'm going to buy some fly shit. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=789.0s)]
*  What you want me to buy? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=790.0s)]
*  Some normal fake ass shit? [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=791.0s)]
*  So during the class, I was like. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=792.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think I was like that girl. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=794.0s)]
*  Yeah, so one of the teachers, she was like, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=795.0s)]
*  you know, you got these shiny ass shorts on, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=797.0s)]
*  you worried about the wrong shit. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=799.0s)]
*  And I thought to myself, look. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=801.0s)]
*  Why would anybody care? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=803.0s)]
*  It's fucking shorts. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=805.0s)]
*  But I thought to myself, and I was like, you know what? [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=807.0s)]
*  You right. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=809.0s)]
*  I am worried about the wrong shit. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=810.0s)]
*  Why am I here playing Bruce Lee Roy with y'all niggas, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=812.0s)]
*  and I got to put a fucking album out? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=814.0s)]
*  So I haven't been to Muay Thai since. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=816.0s)]
*  I've been at the crib trying to finish my... [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=818.0s)]
*  When I get back. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=820.0s)]
*  And I thought about it too, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=822.0s)]
*  because the way it started is because I would always talk about it [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=824.0s)]
*  on my podcast, I got my ass whooped before. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=827.0s)]
*  And he hit me up and was like, yo, you trying to get your ass whooped. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=829.0s)]
*  Come to Muay Thai class. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=832.0s)]
*  And not necessarily me. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=833.0s)]
*  I'm just trying to get in shape. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=834.0s)]
*  I just don't want to, you know. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=835.0s)]
*  I don't want to be fat. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=837.0s)]
*  Well, that's a good thing for getting in shape. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=839.0s)]
*  That burns the shit though, calories. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=841.0s)]
*  It's the funnest thing to get in shape. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=842.0s)]
*  Hitting pads and all that shit. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=843.0s)]
*  You're learning something that's fun. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=844.0s)]
*  It was great. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=845.0s)]
*  And it's tiring. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=846.0s)]
*  No, it was great. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=847.0s)]
*  It was actually great. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=848.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's like the best way to get a cardio in, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=849.0s)]
*  because it's actually fun to do. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=851.0s)]
*  Whereas like a lot of cardio is just suck. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=853.0s)]
*  It's just getting through the suck like a assault bike. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=855.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=858.0s)]
*  That's just getting through suck. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=859.0s)]
*  No, no. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=860.0s)]
*  I was actually having a great time. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=861.0s)]
*  It was like the fun. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=862.0s)]
*  So yeah. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=863.0s)]
*  So I haven't been, I haven't ever since that episode. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=864.0s)]
*  You got to go back. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=867.0s)]
*  And they got to let that go. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=868.0s)]
*  They got to let that shit go. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=869.0s)]
*  I was hanging with... [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=870.0s)]
*  You're Danny Brown. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=871.0s)]
*  You should be allowed to wear whatever fucking shorts you want. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=872.0s)]
*  That's one thing I thought about too though. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=874.0s)]
*  That's what you're supposed to be. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=876.0s)]
*  But you know they sell their own shit too. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=877.0s)]
*  So maybe it felt like I was bad. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=879.0s)]
*  I didn't buy that shit. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=880.0s)]
*  They got to let that shit go. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=881.0s)]
*  All that shit they have in their head about what kind of fucking shorts you have. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=882.0s)]
*  Who gives a shit? [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=885.0s)]
*  But part two, I just looked at it as I never joined this situation as me trying to fight a nigga. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=886.0s)]
*  They're shorts. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=892.0s)]
*  No, I'm saying. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=893.0s)]
*  They're just shorts. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=894.0s)]
*  No, I get it. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=895.0s)]
*  Because even one time we had a conversation, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=896.0s)]
*  it was like, man, you got to know how to protect yourself. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=897.0s)]
*  And this and that. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=899.0s)]
*  I'm like, nigga, if I hit a nigga, I'm going to get sued. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=900.0s)]
*  True. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=903.0s)]
*  And part two, if a nigga hit me, I'm going to shoot this nigga. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=904.0s)]
*  Like guns. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=906.0s)]
*  Like y'all forget that guns exist. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=907.0s)]
*  And we live in Texas. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=910.0s)]
*  I don't give a fuck about how many elbows you throw. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=911.0s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=914.0s)]
*  Because niggas with big ass guns. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=915.0s)]
*  Big ass guns. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=918.0s)]
*  Especially in the climate, the situation that I live in. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=919.0s)]
*  It's not like, you get what I'm saying? [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=923.0s)]
*  Bro. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=924.0s)]
*  So me doing mortals, having to, that was literally, I'm 40 years old. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=925.0s)]
*  I'm not about to fucking fight nobody. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=929.0s)]
*  I would never think that you would. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=932.0s)]
*  But I would. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=935.0s)]
*  I think everybody should learn at least some understanding of martial arts. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=936.0s)]
*  Let me tell you this. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=941.0s)]
*  Be good for everybody. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=942.0s)]
*  One thing it did for me. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=943.0s)]
*  I don't want to talk, I hate this. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=944.0s)]
*  What are you going to do? [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=945.0s)]
*  But I had to say, because I will forget. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=946.0s)]
*  That's my fucked up brain. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=949.0s)]
*  I know podcasting, oh you don't talk about it. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=950.0s)]
*  But I'm sorry. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=953.0s)]
*  But if I don't say it, I'll forget it. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=954.0s)]
*  But it humbled the fuck out of me. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=955.0s)]
*  Because I'm the type of motherfucker, I talk shit. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=958.0s)]
*  Like I get drunk. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=961.0s)]
*  Like, what's up, nigga? [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=962.0s)]
*  What the fuck, nigga? [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=964.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=965.0s)]
*  Nigga, what? [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=966.0s)]
*  Nigga, I seen people, nigga, nurses. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=967.0s)]
*  Women five foot three, 140 pounds, kicking a bag. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=970.0s)]
*  You look like nigga. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=975.0s)]
*  If she hit me with one of these, it's a wrap. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=978.0s)]
*  You get what I'm saying? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=981.0s)]
*  So it humbled the fuck out of me. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=982.0s)]
*  And it made me know that I would never, I never want to fight anyone in my life. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=985.0s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=989.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=990.0s)]
*  It's like everything else. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=991.0s)]
*  It looks way easier than it is. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=992.0s)]
*  If you're watching the UFC and you're watching Israel Adesanya versus Alex Pajera, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=995.0s)]
*  and you're watching the best in the world, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1001.0s)]
*  and you think, if somebody fucks with me, I'm going to do something to them. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1003.0s)]
*  Like you have no idea how far that gap is. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1007.0s)]
*  It's humbling. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1011.0s)]
*  Because a girl's walking around with 140 pounds, right? [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1012.0s)]
*  So that means her muscles in her legs are carrying 140 pounds everywhere she goes. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1015.0s)]
*  If she kicks you in the head, you're going unconscious. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1020.0s)]
*  So yeah, that's what's been happening with my Muay Thai gym. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1023.0s)]
*  That's what happened with the Muay Thai. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1025.0s)]
*  It's good though. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1027.0s)]
*  And that's crazy. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1028.0s)]
*  Actually fucking Tony, they had a party for the Adesanya Pajera fight. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1029.0s)]
*  And he hit me up. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1034.0s)]
*  Tony's like, come through, pull up, pull up. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1035.0s)]
*  But I was sad about the Muay Thai shit. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1037.0s)]
*  Still? [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1040.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1041.0s)]
*  So it turned you off to martial arts? [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1042.0s)]
*  No, no. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1043.0s)]
*  12th planet. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1044.0s)]
*  10th planet. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1046.0s)]
*  10th planet. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1047.0s)]
*  I know. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1048.0s)]
*  But? [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1049.0s)]
*  Day around the corner, right? [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1050.0s)]

*  You don't have to go to the same gym. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1055.0s)]
*  No, as I'm saying, I might. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1057.0s)]

*  No, no. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1067.0s)]
*  Part two is not the person that's running the gym for. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1068.0s)]
*  Bro, Dennis Rodman shows up at your gym. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1071.0s)]
*  You going to tell him what fucking shorts he can wear? [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1073.0s)]

*  So it made me feel bad. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1082.0s)]
*  You know how it is when you trying to be cool? [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1083.0s)]
*  Because I didn't have no muay thai clothes. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1084.0s)]
*  I've been wearing just regular shorts, pulling up. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1085.0s)]
*  I never would wear they gym shit. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1086.0s)]
*  This is the first time I wore the gym t-shirt to the gym. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1088.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1090.0s)]

*  And you suck at muay thai. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1096.0s)]
*  And it's like, bro, I joined muay thai to get in shape. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1097.0s)]
*  So that's what happened. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1101.0s)]
*  Like I said, I haven't been doing muay thai. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1102.0s)]
*  I've been going to a normal gym, just doing normal shit, getting in shape. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1105.0s)]
*  Well, that's good too, but they need to respect the shorts. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1108.0s)]
*  There's this dude named Badr Hari. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1111.0s)]
*  He's still an active kickboxer. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1113.0s)]
*  But at one point in time, he was like one of the best in the world, if not the best, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1114.0s)]
*  in the heavyweight division. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1118.0s)]
*  And he would fight like golf shorts on. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1119.0s)]
*  I've been watching a lot of One. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1121.0s)]
*  Oh, One Championship? [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1123.0s)]

*  Whew. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1125.0s)]
*  That dude's a beast. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1126.0s)]
*  I like that because they have to just straight muay thai fights and shit like that. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1128.0s)]
*  So I like watching their shit. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1132.0s)]
*  Did you see when Rod Tang fought Mighty Mouse? [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1133.0s)]
*  Yeah, Mighty Mouse with his ass. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1135.0s)]
*  They had a mixed fight. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1137.0s)]
*  Yeah, they had a mixed fight. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1138.0s)]
*  It was one round, this one round. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1139.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1140.0s)]
*  Mighty Mouse fucked him up. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1141.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, Mighty Mouse got through the first round and landed some good shots. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1142.0s)]
*  I look up to Mighty Mouse so much, man. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1145.0s)]
*  He's so good. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1147.0s)]
*  He's so good. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1148.0s)]
*  Bro, like I look at, I know it's like weird. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1149.0s)]
*  I mean, because I don't like, I mean, a lot of people feel like shit like race baiting [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1153.0s)]
*  and shit like that. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1158.0s)]
*  But you got to think like martial arts and like urban communities are not like, it's [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1159.0s)]
*  not like, it's not fucking muay thai gym up the street. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1163.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1167.0s)]
*  So for a person to be from the hood and be like, man, I want to, you know, get into that [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1168.0s)]

*  Niggas do all type of shit. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1175.0s)]
*  It's actually, I guess for the most part, it would be boxing. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1176.0s)]
*  Boxing is easier to get into, but like jujitsu is expensive. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1180.0s)]
*  Because even me, I can't lie, I was always like, crunk. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1184.0s)]
*  Like me being from Detroit is always with boxing gyms around that I could, if I wanted [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1187.0s)]

*  It's not because I have muscles. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1353.0s)]
*  And then you don't got waves. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1354.0s)]

*  What I was saying that to say is, that's like a defense mechanism for a lot of people. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1371.0s)]
*  Where they feel like, I don't have to. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1375.0s)]
*  If I'm just good enough shape to look good in the clothes that I want to wear, that's good enough. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1377.0s)]
*  That's good enough. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1382.0s)]
*  I don't have to be muscular. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1383.0s)]
*  Yeah, that makes sense. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1385.0s)]
*  It's also, it shows that like, this is what you care about more. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1386.0s)]
*  Aesthetics and style and cool shit. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1389.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1392.0s)]
*  Cool shit. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1393.0s)]
*  God damn it. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1394.0s)]
*  You want to hit me with the fucking fire. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1395.0s)]
*  Nice clothes are cool shit. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1396.0s)]
*  That's all I care about. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1398.0s)]
*  I know you do. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1399.0s)]
*  But you know what's fucked up about me? [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1400.0s)]
*  I think where I'm at this point in my life, where I'm at, God damn it, Daniel, like you got to grow up. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1401.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1408.0s)]
*  Cause I lived my entire life as a teenager. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1409.0s)]
*  I would try to hold that back. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1411.0s)]
*  If you and I were closer, I would try to tell you to not grow up and just stay who you are. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1412.0s)]
*  You have to have money to not grow up. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1418.0s)]
*  I think you could get both. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1421.0s)]
*  I mean, I've done good with myself. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1423.0s)]
*  I know you have, but when I watch your podcast, I'm like, this dude has a fucking hilarious podcast. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1425.0s)]
*  Me and Tom talked about it on the phone. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1430.0s)]
*  I called him up. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1432.0s)]
*  I go, dude, Danny Brown kills me. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1433.0s)]
*  I go, I watch that show all the time. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1435.0s)]
*  He goes, he's so good. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1437.0s)]
*  And I go, isn't it amazing that someone could just like jump into podcasting? [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1438.0s)]
*  But now I get it because you were always a fan of listening to podcasts. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1441.0s)]
*  So you were kind of talking. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1446.0s)]
*  You're kind of having those conversations in your head. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1447.0s)]
*  No, you want to hear some other real shit too? [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1450.0s)]
*  Is my entire musical career, it wouldn't have been what it was if I didn't do interviews. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1452.0s)]
*  How's that? [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1459.0s)]
*  My music is one thing. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1460.0s)]
*  You hear what I'm saying? [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1463.0s)]
*  But when you meet me and talk to me, people like that more than they like my music. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1464.0s)]
*  I see what you're saying. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1469.0s)]
*  So like your personality goes along with it. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1471.0s)]
*  And it sells the music. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1473.0s)]
*  Then once you like me, then you like, oh, I like his music a little bit. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1474.0s)]
*  You hear what I'm saying? [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1479.0s)]
*  So I think that's what it is. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1480.0s)]
*  That's the same for comics with podcasts. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1481.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1483.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, it definitely is. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1484.0s)]
*  I see a lot of hated comics that get a lot of views and get a lot of doing good for themselves. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1485.0s)]
*  Like Hate Watch. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1490.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know, man. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1491.0s)]
*  There's a lot of recreational outrage. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1493.0s)]
*  But I think for the most part, if you get better and you keep doing it. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1496.0s)]
*  Just need to say, a brand new shop have fired. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1501.0s)]
*  I like the way you got dressed. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1503.0s)]
*  I think your dress is good. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1504.0s)]
*  Listen, I'm wearing a hoodie. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1506.0s)]
*  I dressed terrible. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1508.0s)]
*  But we did get dressed up. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1510.0s)]
*  I did a show with Tony Hinchcliffe, Brian Simpson, and Hans Kim at the MGM. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1513.0s)]
*  Those are all my homies. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1518.0s)]
*  We got David August to design suits. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1520.0s)]
*  So they were custom made suits. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1522.0s)]
*  You want to see this shit? [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1524.0s)]
*  Look at this picture. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1525.0s)]
*  I'm going to show you something. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1526.0s)]
*  No, yeah, show me something. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1527.0s)]
*  No, I did smile. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1528.0s)]
*  Listen, I'm not always gross. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1529.0s)]
*  No, I never thought about that. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1531.0s)]
*  I don't mean it that way. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1533.0s)]
*  But I mean, most of the time I just don't give a fuck about what I'm wearing. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1534.0s)]
*  I wear what I like to wear. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1537.0s)]
*  What looks comfortable for me. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1538.0s)]
*  Let me tell you like this. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1539.0s)]
*  I like the shirt. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1540.0s)]
*  If you was to hop on some fashion shit and show up with a crazy fucking Gucci shirt on [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1541.0s)]
*  or something like that. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1546.0s)]
*  I would judge you way more. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1547.0s)]
*  I would judge you way more than anything else. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1549.0s)]
*  You give it a say? [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1553.0s)]
*  Of course. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1554.0s)]
*  Then you're trying hard. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1555.0s)]
*  You know, the thing is with me is it's fashion is about us being, I mean, we won't be in [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1556.0s)]
*  race in urban communities, but you know what they say like black people or when you broke [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1562.0s)]
*  you don't got to like that. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1567.0s)]
*  So you just want to kind of look like you got to like that. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1569.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1572.0s)]
*  So being in the hood. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1573.0s)]
*  I completely get it. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1574.0s)]
*  So yeah, so being in the hood. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1575.0s)]
*  That's with Italians as well. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1576.0s)]
*  It's very, very similar with my family. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1577.0s)]
*  So that's all it is. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1578.0s)]
*  In my whole fashion, bro, fashion fucked up my school. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1579.0s)]
*  Like I fucked up my life. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1584.0s)]
*  How? [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1585.0s)]
*  Because I would skip school all the time just to go buy clothes. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1586.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1590.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1591.0s)]
*  Hudson's. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1592.0s)]
*  Oh, see, it's not called Hudson's anymore. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1593.0s)]
*  Oh, Hudson's to what people would be, it would be Macy's. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1595.0s)]
*  So Macy's had a clearance sale. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1600.0s)]
*  The clearance sale is happening on Tuesday. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1604.0s)]

*  The only thing I like to bet on is fights. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1915.28s)]
*  The other side. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1918.08s)]
*  Flip it to the other side. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1919.08s)]
*  And then pull that thing down. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1920.08s)]
*  That black thing. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1921.08s)]

*  Oh shit. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1929.08s)]
*  Yeah, I mean that's the reason why they're so big. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1930.08s)]
*  They're not big because they lose money. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1933.4s)]
*  These fucking giant places run out of juice. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1935.8799999999999s)]

*  My bad. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1941.8799999999999s)]

*  I used to play a lot of pool. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1947.32s)]
*  I was always around these dudes that were like hardcore gambling addicts. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1949.32s)]
*  They would gamble on pool. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1953.76s)]
*  They would gamble on playing poker. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1954.76s)]
*  They would all do off track betting. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1957.1599999999999s)]
*  Because in New York, you could gamble on horse racing and shit. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1959.76s)]
*  Carriage racing. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1964.4399999999998s)]
*  You could gamble on so many different things. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1965.4399999999998s)]
*  So the pool hall was where all the gambling junkies hung out. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1967.6s)]
*  Everything scares the shit out of me. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1972.04s)]
*  Only thing I ever gamble on. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1973.6399999999999s)]
*  We just shoot dice. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1975.6399999999999s)]
*  To what? [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1977.56s)]
*  Shoot dice. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1978.56s)]
*  Oh, shoot dice. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1979.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1980.56s)]
*  Yeah, in the bathroom in high school. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1981.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1982.56s)]
*  Gambling's exciting. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1983.56s)]
*  But it should be fucking legal. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1984.56s)]
*  The idea that it's not legal in some places. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1985.56s)]
*  I mean sports gambling is one of the things that's, you know what I'm saying? [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1987.72s)]
*  Because even- [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1993.0s)]
*  It's fun. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1994.0s)]
*  Sports gambling is fun. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1995.0s)]
*  I hate to say it, man, but the out of sign of fight, I knew he was going to lose. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=1996.0s)]
*  How could you say that? [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2000.56s)]
*  He almost won. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2003.0s)]
*  He was three rounds down. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2004.0s)]
*  I ain't going to lie. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2005.0s)]
*  Or three rounds up rather. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2006.0s)]
*  Just his eyes. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2007.0s)]
*  His eyes. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2008.0s)]
*  Something about him, when he was talking. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2009.0s)]
*  Come on. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2010.0s)]
*  And I was just, I swear, this is me. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2011.0s)]
*  His eyes, this is what his eyes were. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2012.62s)]
*  No, this is me. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2014.1s)]
*  And I bet on a lot of fights and I win a lot. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2015.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2019.1399999999999s)]
*  But I would say I bet against him on a cannoneer fight. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2020.74s)]
*  So I was- [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2023.3s)]
*  Well, that's a risky bet too. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2024.3s)]
*  Yeah, that was a- but I thought I was trying to come up. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2025.3s)]
*  I was being- I was trying to come up. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2027.3s)]
*  But this fight, I just kind of felt, I felt sorry for him kind of. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2029.46s)]
*  Like I knew it. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2033.82s)]
*  Like just his eyes, the way he looked. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2034.82s)]
*  Something about the way he looked and the way- even when he walked out. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2036.54s)]
*  Just something in his face to me, I was like, man, this nigga about to lose. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2040.22s)]
*  And I wanted to call all my homies and be like, man, bet, bet, bet against other- but [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2043.5s)]
*  I didn't want to lose people money. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2047.26s)]
*  So I just kept my shit to myself and I was like- [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2048.7s)]
*  But I honestly felt to myself like this nigga about to lose. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2050.7s)]
*  This is what you're seeing. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2053.38s)]
*  You're not seeing that he's thinking he's going to lose or that he's scared to lose. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2054.38s)]
*  What you're seeing is the magnitude of the guy's about to fight. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2058.18s)]
*  And that's- you can't change that. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2062.06s)]
*  It doesn't change how a man performs once he's under duress and stress. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2064.3399999999997s)]
*  But you can't ignore the magnitude. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2068.3399999999997s)]
*  And if you ever go back and watch Mike Tyson fights, this is where you see it the best. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2070.8999999999996s)]
*  When dudes were walking into that ring to fight Mike Tyson, they looked like they were being [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2076.1s)]
*  executed. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2080.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2081.66s)]
*  They were going to their death. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2082.66s)]
*  They were getting arrested. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2083.66s)]
*  They were getting processed. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2084.66s)]
*  They had this look in their face like- [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2085.66s)]
*  Fuck. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2088.14s)]
*  They ain't had that look on his face to you. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2089.14s)]

*  What he had, a look on his face is an understanding of what that fucking guy can do. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2093.3799999999997s)]
*  Or what could happen. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2098.8199999999997s)]
*  That guy- [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2099.8199999999997s)]
*  But I never seen that from him. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2100.8199999999997s)]
*  I never seen it. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2101.8199999999997s)]

*  That guy knocked him out in kickback. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2104.8999999999996s)]
*  I know, I seen it. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2105.8999999999996s)]

*  But that's how good Pahetta is. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2155.86s)]
*  He's that good. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2158.7000000000003s)]

*  He's that good. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2160.7000000000003s)]
*  But see, that's one thing, that's what I was saying. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2161.7000000000003s)]
*  Me just fucking with the Muay Thai class and shit. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2165.2200000000003s)]
*  Dude, I was trying to warn people. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2167.1800000000003s)]
*  Because a lot of the time, I get drunk, I talk shit. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2168.1800000000003s)]
*  Of course you do. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2170.6200000000003s)]
*  I talk shit to people. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2171.6200000000003s)]
*  Now imagine talking shit to a guy like Pahetta. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2172.6200000000003s)]
*  But no, not even that. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2173.6200000000003s)]
*  I'm not talking shit to a fucking nurse. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2174.9s)]
*  Fucking secretary. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2176.9s)]
*  That's been taking Muay Thai for three years. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2177.9s)]
*  She needs you with the nuts. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2180.9s)]
*  You don't even know this bitch do anything. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2181.9s)]
*  And that's what I seen. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2182.9s)]
*  They actually had a stamp fair attack. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2183.9s)]
*  She actually did a session. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2186.9s)]
*  I mean a thing at our gym. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2188.46s)]
*  Oh wow. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2190.46s)]
*  And just even seeing her and how small she is and that. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2191.46s)]
*  Like bro. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2194.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2195.2599999999998s)]
*  Bro, I'm good. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2196.2599999999998s)]
*  I'm good. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2197.2599999999998s)]
*  So, I mean it humbled me. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2198.2599999999998s)]
*  I will say that. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2199.2599999999998s)]
*  Well, it's just a little bit of reality check. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2201.2599999999998s)]
*  The thing is, we live in Texas. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2204.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2206.9s)]
*  And all these niggas got guns. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2207.9s)]
*  For sure. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2209.9s)]
*  Everybody got guns. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2210.9s)]
*  So, it's like what is... [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2211.9s)]
*  You can't even... [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2212.9s)]
*  Listen, no one is ever saying that martial arts are better than having a gun. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2213.9s)]
*  No one's ever saying that. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2217.9s)]
*  What I'm saying is, just for your own head. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2218.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2221.9s)]
*  Just for your own head, it's good to know how to fight. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2222.9s)]
*  So, if someone gets crazy with you, you just go, okay. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2224.9s)]
*  Last time I was in the gym, they was like, well, you know, we was talking about that kind [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2228.9s)]
*  of thing. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2232.9s)]
*  I can't fight nobody. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2234.54s)]
*  They're going to sue me. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2235.54s)]
*  You don't want to fight somebody. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2236.54s)]
*  But what I'm saying is, what if somebody wants to fight you? [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2237.54s)]
*  That's why you got guns. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2239.54s)]
*  Yeah, but if you don't get to the gun, it's just a good thing. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2240.94s)]
*  I'm going to have it on me. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2243.94s)]
*  I believe you. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2245.44s)]
*  And especially since we're here and you can have it. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2246.44s)]
*  It's a good thing to know. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2248.1s)]
*  So, it makes sense just to have a gun. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2249.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2250.1s)]
*  Especially as a black man in America. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2251.1s)]
*  Do you believe that a well-armed society is a polite society? [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2252.7000000000003s)]
*  No. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2256.7000000000003s)]
*  No? [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2257.7000000000003s)]
*  Not at all? [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2258.7000000000003s)]
*  No. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2259.7000000000003s)]
*  Because just me being able to travel and going to Europe and shit like that where guns [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2260.7000000000003s)]
*  are a thing and I see how well-behaved people act because of that simple notion. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2263.82s)]
*  Like right now, like what I talked about, like going to Muay Thai, how much that humbled [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2270.2200000000003s)]
*  me and being that. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2273.06s)]
*  But at the end of the day, I should never have that feeling anyway. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2274.06s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2277.2200000000003s)]
*  No one should have that feeling. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2278.2200000000003s)]
*  But only reason why I have that feeling because I know guns exist. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2279.2200000000003s)]
*  And if I have a gun on me, you can't say shit. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2282.3s)]
*  I don't give a fuck how muscle you got. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2284.1400000000003s)]
*  I'll shoot you, bitch. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2285.34s)]
*  Shut the fuck up. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2286.34s)]
*  But now, in over those countries, it's all about brute strength. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2287.34s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2290.7000000000003s)]
*  It's knives and you know what I'm saying? [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2291.7000000000003s)]
*  You gotta be rich to have a gun. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2293.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2295.46s)]
*  And we over here, we got motherfucking niggas over here making 3D print it. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2296.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2299.7s)]
*  I can get a 3D printer heater right now. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2300.7s)]
*  They're making ghost guns. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2302.8999999999996s)]
*  Shoot. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2303.8999999999996s)]
*  Same way. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2304.8999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2305.8999999999996s)]
*  But it makes sense. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2306.8999999999996s)]
*  They could 3D print everything now. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2307.8999999999996s)]
*  But the guns is different. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2308.8999999999996s)]
*  They make fake Rolexes that are exactly the same as a Rolex. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2309.8999999999996s)]
*  That's still fake. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2312.2999999999997s)]
*  That's still fake. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2313.2999999999997s)]
*  But you know what I'm saying? [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2314.2999999999997s)]
*  Like they do that. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2315.2999999999997s)]
*  There's like a whole market. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2316.2999999999997s)]
*  They can make a gun easy. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2317.2999999999997s)]
*  It's replica of anything, but a replica of a gun still keeps it. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2318.2999999999997s)]
*  It's a real gun. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2321.42s)]
*  It's a real gun. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2322.42s)]
*  And they can 3D print them. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2323.42s)]
*  Wasn't there a guy that like invented this shit a long time ago? [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2324.42s)]
*  And there was like some big controversy about it. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2329.42s)]
*  He was showing people how to 3D print guns like on YouTube or something like that. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2331.42s)]
*  No, it's still going on. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2334.42s)]
*  I know. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2335.42s)]
*  I know. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2336.42s)]
*  I know. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2337.42s)]
*  But wasn't there a guy that was like one of the first guys that was censored off of YouTube? [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2338.42s)]
*  Am I misremembering this? [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2341.42s)]
*  I may be. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2342.42s)]
*  I might be misremembering this. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2345.42s)]
*  I might be. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2346.42s)]
*  I might be. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2347.42s)]
*  I might be. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2348.42s)]
*  I might be. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2349.42s)]
*  I might be misremembered. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2350.54s)]
*  But I remember when that shit first started happening where they were making 3D printed [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2351.54s)]
*  guns and people like, this is insane. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2354.86s)]
*  Like we have to stop this. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2356.94s)]
*  And they're like, well, there's no law that can stop it. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2357.94s)]
*  And it was like, I guess it's state by state. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2360.1s)]
*  No, no. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2363.1s)]
*  But yeah, they 3D print guns. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2364.1s)]
*  Go, go. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2367.1s)]

*  No, that's all it was. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2388.7s)]
*  God damn it. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2389.7s)]
*  I've been drinking. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2390.7s)]
*  No, because I've been on this. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2391.7s)]
*  I wake up at like 5 a.m. and I'm. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2392.7s)]
*  Yeah? [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2393.7s)]
*  No, but I'm an early sleeper. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2394.7s)]
*  Yeah, I'm an early sleeper anyway. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2395.7s)]
*  So it's not like what happened was, you know, I motherfuckers talk about that on some workout [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2396.7s)]
*  shit and be like, ugh. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2401.14s)]
*  I'm just actually one of those guys that do that. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2402.54s)]
*  So it was like, man, maybe I should take advantage of that shit. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2405.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2407.8599999999997s)]
*  I wake up at like 5. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2409.5s)]
*  Yeah, so I do. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2410.5s)]
*  I wake up at 5. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2411.5s)]
*  Because I never was like a workout person. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2412.5s)]
*  But now I can get so much shit done before my grill even work up. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2414.86s)]
*  Like when 10 a.m. comes, like, oh my god, bitch, you don't even know. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2418.82s)]
*  I'm dead. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2423.3s)]
*  Did I got to watch the dogs and shit and go to sleep and shit? [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2424.3s)]
*  But yeah, so now I've been just taking advantage of being able to wake up that early. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2427.2200000000003s)]
*  But I think that's come from stress type shit. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2432.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2436.02s)]
*  To be honest. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2437.02s)]
*  I was just talking about, actually, you know who was just here? [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2438.18s)]
*  Fucking Hannibal. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2445.14s)]
*  Hannibal was fucking here. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2446.14s)]
*  I was doing my fucking show. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2448.62s)]
*  I wish I would fucking knew he was here. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2450.9s)]
*  Then he just showed up. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2452.2599999999998s)]
*  I was like, man, you might as well come over here with us. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2453.2599999999998s)]
*  But he had to leave. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2455.34s)]
*  But no. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2457.38s)]
*  Fuck off. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2458.38s)]
*  Fuck off. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2459.38s)]
*  But no, Hannibal. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2460.38s)]
*  No. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2461.38s)]
*  We were talking about. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2462.38s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2463.38s)]
*  I was just telling him that I feel like when you know, you all as comedians and shit, you [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2464.7400000000002s)]
*  all make specials, it's like instant gratification in that sense. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2469.06s)]
*  Because you all could do. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2472.86s)]
*  I mean, I know you all worked on a special for years and years, but then you all actually [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2473.86s)]
*  do it in front of a live audience. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2477.7000000000003s)]
*  Even though the audience know it's a special. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2479.7000000000003s)]
*  I mean, it is what it is. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2482.1800000000003s)]
*  You know, you all do the special. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2483.1800000000003s)]
*  Have you thought about doing specials? [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2484.1800000000003s)]
*  I know you're doing a little stand up. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2485.98s)]
*  No I'm not. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2487.7000000000003s)]
*  Not at all? [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2488.7000000000003s)]
*  At Kill Tony? [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2489.7000000000003s)]
*  No, no. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2490.7000000000003s)]
*  I mean, I go on there and I have fun and shit. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2491.7000000000003s)]
*  Didn't you do like a minute on Kill Tony? [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2493.02s)]
*  No. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2495.74s)]
*  You never did? [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2496.74s)]
*  I didn't do nothing, but. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2497.74s)]
*  You only just sat as a guest? [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2498.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2500.74s)]
*  Okay. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2501.74s)]
*  But now I'm starting to take it serious because all y'all motherfuckers keep telling me I'm [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2502.74s)]
*  funny. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2504.98s)]
*  I know what it is. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2505.98s)]
*  It's Tony. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2506.98s)]
*  Tony was telling me that he's trying to get you to do it. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2507.98s)]
*  No, everybody keeps telling me that I'm funny. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2508.98s)]
*  They're like, you can do it. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2509.98s)]
*  That's what I'm talking about. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2510.98s)]
*  You can do it. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2511.98s)]
*  But you know, the thing is that I'm a nerd about is the writing aspect of it. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2512.98s)]
*  Good. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2519.18s)]
*  So I love to write. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2520.18s)]
*  Even me writing songs, I always say this all the time. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2522.02s)]
*  I probably, I don't know. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2524.54s)]
*  I mean, I'm better of a writer than I'm a rapper. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2526.3s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2529.38s)]
*  Danny, you're a funny dude. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2530.98s)]
*  I mean. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2532.78s)]
*  You 100% could do stand up. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2533.78s)]
*  You just like the way you approach music and the way you now have approached podcasting, [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2535.5s)]
*  you could do stand up. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2541.02s)]
*  No, no. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2542.02s)]
*  See, that's the thing about it. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2543.02s)]
*  Just the fact that someone like you tell me, someone like Tom hanging with Tony. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2544.02s)]
*  So it's like I'll be a dickhead to not try. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2548.94s)]
*  You have to try. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2551.44s)]
*  And not to do. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2552.44s)]
*  You should do it. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2553.44s)]
*  The whole shit in the beginning was like, man, I bombed that rap for like 20 years. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2554.44s)]
*  Why would I want to stand on stage and try to tell jokes and bomb and go through that? [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2559.2400000000002s)]
*  But then I actually started thinking about it and I'm like, maybe this is like a second [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2566.04s)]
*  call in my life. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2570.0s)]
*  This is why I think it is. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2571.92s)]
*  On your show, you have hilarious stories and you got a great way of telling them. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2573.48s)]
*  You have a great way of telling stories. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2579.84s)]
*  It's fun. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2581.6800000000003s)]
*  It's funny. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2582.6800000000003s)]
*  No, that's the thing that I love about doing it. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2583.6800000000003s)]
*  I'm having fun right now. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2584.6800000000003s)]
*  You can just translate that to stand up. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2585.6800000000003s)]
*  You watch Tim Dillon? [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2588.2400000000002s)]
*  No, I love Tim Dillon. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2589.2400000000002s)]
*  That's what Tim Dillon does. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2590.98s)]
*  He does that rant on his show. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2592.1200000000003s)]
*  He's the best ranter alive. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2594.0800000000004s)]
*  He does these rants and then he takes chunks of those rants and they become bits. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2595.48s)]
*  That's how you come up with the material. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2600.36s)]
*  It's like what you're doing is next door neighbor to stand up. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2601.5600000000004s)]
*  Yo, see, that's the thing too. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2605.28s)]
*  You can't always be like, see I was always that guy. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2607.68s)]
*  I was funnier. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2610.24s)]
*  You can be the funniest guy at the family reunion, but that don't translate on stage. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2611.56s)]
*  But Danny, you know how to be on stage. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2616.7999999999997s)]
*  You know how to be in front of the camera. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2619.0s)]
*  For me being a rapper. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2620.48s)]
*  You're saying it doesn't translate on stage. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2621.48s)]
*  Even in front of the camera. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2623.56s)]
*  You're saying it doesn't translate on stage, but that's just like your funny uncle who [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2624.56s)]
*  can't go on stage at an open mic night because he's fucking nervous. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2628.72s)]
*  That's who I am. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2631.3199999999997s)]
*  But you're not that because you're not nervous. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2632.3199999999997s)]
*  You're not nervous doing your podcast and you're not nervous when you're rapping. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2634.56s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2637.96s)]
*  So you're not nervous in front of people. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2639.36s)]
*  No, you tell stories in front of people in front of the camera and they're fucking hilarious. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2640.92s)]
*  You're not nervous doing that. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2646.24s)]
*  You're not. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2647.6s)]
*  It's not the same thing. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2648.6s)]
*  I think you know one thing that I'm scared of is that I respect comedy so much and I [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2649.6s)]
*  know it's like it's almost gatekeeping. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2655.12s)]
*  It shouldn't be. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2658.84s)]
*  That's good. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2659.92s)]
*  But you understand what I'm saying? [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2660.92s)]
*  But it's not really gatekeeping. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2661.92s)]
*  We really do let anybody in. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2663.48s)]
*  Let's imagine, okay let's say tomorrow, if I'm just super good with comedy, comedians [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2665.48s)]
*  will hate me. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2671.0s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2672.0s)]
*  The dumb ones. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2673.0s)]
*  And I want to be friends with people too. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2674.0s)]
*  Listen bro, they're not going to hate you. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2675.0s)]
*  The ones that are going to hate you are idiots. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2676.12s)]
*  Idiot comedians will hate you. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2679.2000000000003s)]
*  This is like Royal Rumble. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2680.2000000000003s)]
*  But if you're good, you're good. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2681.2000000000003s)]
*  Being a comedian is like being in a Royal Rumble. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2684.2000000000003s)]
*  Who don't throw each other off the first day. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2686.88s)]
*  You get what I'm saying? [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2688.8s)]
*  Even now with podcasting, having a beef with another comedian like driving you views. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2689.88s)]
*  So now I already see, before we know it, niggas going to be like podcast comedian beefs, [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2694.6800000000003s)]
*  going to be like rap songs and shit. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2700.2000000000003s)]
*  We one step away from that. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2702.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, well that's always going to happen with some people. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2703.92s)]
*  Some people just love to get mad and talk shit about people. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2706.1200000000003s)]
*  It's like their favorite recreation. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2709.6800000000003s)]
*  But that's the way they get the views and that's the way they drop shit. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2710.88s)]
*  You don't have to participate in that. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2713.32s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2714.6800000000003s)]
*  But what I'm saying about you. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2715.6800000000003s)]
*  I'm not going to participate in that because you're going to figure out if Des Mois type [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2717.56s)]
*  works. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2720.44s)]
*  Niggas come on some podcast talking shit about Danny Brown. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2721.44s)]
*  I ain't coming back on no podcast talking about you. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2725.64s)]
*  What I'm trying to say is you have zero fears about being gate-keeped. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2728.3199999999997s)]
*  People are just going to want to see if you can do it. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2733.56s)]
*  Go have fun. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2735.2799999999997s)]
*  People already love you from your show. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2736.2799999999997s)]
*  They love you from your mom's house. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2738.12s)]
*  They love you when you guest on Kill Tony. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2740.16s)]
*  You can just do it. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2742.56s)]
*  Yeah, no, no. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2744.12s)]
*  That's where I'm at now because you got to think that's a total 360 for my rap career. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2745.56s)]
*  It is and it isn't, man. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2750.44s)]
*  I don't even, Joe Rogan, I don't think you know. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2752.3199999999997s)]
*  It's your creativity. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2754.52s)]
*  It's your creativity. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2755.52s)]
*  It's your mind. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2756.52s)]
*  My rap career is a total different world than what this is. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2757.52s)]
*  Of course. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2760.16s)]
*  My rap career, I would say, what made that bad is that I started a little too old. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2761.16s)]
*  So I didn't really get recognition or, you know, until I was 30 years old. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2768.32s)]
*  And you got to think I've been trying to do this my entire 20s. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2775.0800000000004s)]
*  So when I started to be a rapper, get recognition for it and being that, I had a bitter attitude [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2779.38s)]
*  towards it. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2784.76s)]
*  You get what I'm saying? [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2785.76s)]
*  Because it takes so long for it to happen. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2787.28s)]
*  That happens a lot. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2789.88s)]
*  And then now I'm 30 years old. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2790.88s)]
*  It's a 30-year-old rapper. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2793.1600000000003s)]
*  It's like a ticking time bomb at that point, how much time you got. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2796.28s)]
*  Really? [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2799.84s)]
*  So I'm already in my head. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2800.84s)]
*  I will say, a lot of people say being a rapper is dangerous because of all the killings and [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2802.36s)]
*  shit. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2809.1200000000003s)]
*  But I will say being a rapper is dangerous in a sense because once you do it, you can't [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2810.2000000000003s)]
*  do nothing else. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2815.44s)]
*  It ruins you. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2817.8s)]
*  How so? [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2818.8s)]
*  Okay, let's just say I was a rapper and then it failed. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2819.8s)]
*  Then I got to go get a normal job. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2824.76s)]
*  But I had minimal success. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2827.0800000000004s)]
*  You saw my video somewhere. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2829.2000000000003s)]
*  I had a couple of views. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2830.48s)]
*  Now I'm working at a job with you. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2831.8s)]
*  Now you're like, oh you. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2833.48s)]
*  Blah blah. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2835.48s)]
*  So that, everywhere you go, somebody, you was a... [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2837.6000000000004s)]
*  That's true if you're an actor too. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2842.6400000000003s)]
*  So you're always recognized. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2843.6400000000003s)]
*  That's true if you're an actor too. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2844.6400000000003s)]
*  So you're always getting acknowledged for your failures. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2845.6400000000003s)]
*  But that's true with anybody in the public eye. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2848.32s)]
*  So just imagine, every time someone recognizes you, they're acknowledging your failure. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2849.92s)]
*  That hurts. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2857.6400000000003s)]
*  It hurts. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2858.6400000000003s)]
*  Of course it does. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2859.6400000000003s)]
*  But that's what happens in all walks of life. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2863.6400000000003s)]
*  Anytime when you fail and people get to shit on you and if you're a public person... [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2866.76s)]
*  If you work fries at McDonald's, no one cares. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2870.76s)]
*  Don't you remember Gary Coleman? [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2873.6s)]
*  The nigga. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2875.32s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2876.32s)]
*  Gary Coleman from Different Strokes? [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2877.32s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2878.32s)]
*  And people would just shit on him relentlessly. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2879.76s)]
*  Imagine that. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2881.76s)]
*  Because if he was just a security guard, no one would care. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2882.76s)]
*  You would never walk up to a security guard and go, look at this fucking loser. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2885.1200000000003s)]
*  You're a security guard. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2888.28s)]
*  That's exactly what I'm saying. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2889.28s)]
*  It's the same thing with actors. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2890.28s)]
*  So me being Danny Brown. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2891.28s)]
*  I can never go back to being Daniel. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2892.48s)]
*  You don't have to, first of all. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2897.04s)]
*  And don't. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2898.8s)]
*  And don't even think about it. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2899.8s)]
*  Don't even think about it. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2900.8s)]
*  You don't have to. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2901.8s)]
*  You're never going to have to do that. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2902.8s)]
*  I know what you're saying. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2904.68s)]
*  But you can't think about worst case scenario and dwell on it like that. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2906.12s)]
*  You are of personality. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2911.7999999999997s)]
*  And a personality can do anything it wants to do. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2914.72s)]
*  You're a fun guy. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2918.0s)]
*  I think about that and I love that too. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2919.0s)]
*  Because you gotta think, the last album I put out was 2019. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2921.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, you were saying that. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2924.44s)]
*  Like you're touring infrequently. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2926.72s)]
*  No, I worked on that album with Q-Tip. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2929.24s)]
*  To be able to work with Q-Tip was such a fucking big deal to me. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2932.88s)]
*  For sure. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2937.2s)]
*  And you know, it gave me confidence in my music. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2938.2s)]
*  To be in the fact that A Tribe Called Quest was my dad's favorite rap group. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2942.48s)]
*  I remember going to, my dad taking me to fucking preschool. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2947.84s)]
*  I mean I'm preschool. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2950.64s)]
*  It wasn't that early, but whatever. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2952.2s)]
*  But elementary school, my dad taking me to school and he listening to A Tribe Called Quest. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2954.68s)]
*  And before I knew it, one day I'm sitting in the studio with Q-Tip every day working [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2959.88s)]
*  on an album. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2964.2400000000002s)]
*  So it was a big deal. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2965.2400000000002s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2968.2000000000003s)]
*  It was a big deal for me. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2969.2000000000003s)]
*  And you know, we made that album and I just think the world of music has changed so much. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2970.2000000000003s)]
*  You know, I feel like a 10 second TikTok beat means way more than you putting out a single. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2979.8s)]
*  You understand what I'm saying? [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2991.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2992.0s)]
*  Like that whole shit changed. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2993.0s)]
*  So the way I grew up, the way I grew up, like me, my favorite rapper is Nas. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2994.6400000000003s)]
*  And Nas just put out a new album and that album is fucking amazing. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=2999.52s)]
*  You know why that album is amazing? [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3004.1200000000003s)]
*  It's because Nas is having fucking fun. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3005.7599999999998s)]
*  And Nas is able to make music without any fucking... [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3008.64s)]
*  You gotta think... [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3011.7599999999998s)]
*  Well Nas is really rich. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3012.7599999999998s)]
*  Like he's got a bunch of different businesses. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3014.64s)]
*  It wasn't always like that though. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3016.12s)]
*  No, but I'm saying like right now, if he's doing rap right now, it's because he wants [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3017.72s)]
*  to do it. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3021.48s)]
*  Yes, but it wasn't always like that. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3022.48s)]
*  He had the whole situation of what he went through with his divorces and all. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3023.8s)]
*  But I'm saying... [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3027.6s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3028.6s)]
*  It's all public. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3029.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3030.6s)]
*  He's the best lyricist ever, in my opinion. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3031.6s)]
*  His fucking shit is so complicated. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3033.12s)]
*  The way he does things backwards... [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3035.44s)]
*  What's that one song where he does backwards, rewind? [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3036.7999999999997s)]
*  That's a brilliant song. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3040.24s)]
*  You want to have this coming, bro. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3041.24s)]
*  We don't want to talk about this. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3042.24s)]
*  Just for me. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3044.56s)]
*  So Nas is like... [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3045.56s)]
*  And I've had the opportunity to meet Nas a lot. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3047.2s)]
*  I won't say a lot, but he knows what he means to me. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3050.96s)]
*  You get what I'm saying? [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3056.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3057.52s)]
*  So actually he wanted to sign me to his label. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3058.52s)]
*  I didn't sign to him because... [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3062.52s)]
*  I mean, whatever. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3066.52s)]
*  I mean, money, man. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3070.12s)]
*  Money, money, man. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3071.84s)]
*  The other contract was more money, man. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3072.84s)]
*  And that's what it is. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3076.0s)]
*  But sometimes I think about that, did I make a mistake? [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3077.0s)]
*  But like, damn, just because the artist that I looked up to my entire life that made me [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3079.0s)]
*  be a rapper, tried to sign me and I didn't sign with him, all because of money. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3084.36s)]
*  No, I'm not saying I feel any way about being with Warp. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3092.08s)]
*  I love Warp. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3098.68s)]
*  Warp is... [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3099.68s)]
*  They've done... [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3100.68s)]
*  Part two, Warp has made me a better artist than what I actually am. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3101.68s)]
*  How's that? [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3105.32s)]
*  Because, okay, just even out. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3106.32s)]
*  The album that I just... [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3108.68s)]
*  I made an album during COVID, obviously. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3109.68s)]
*  We were sitting around when nobody could do nothing. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3114.4s)]
*  And I just felt like, oh shit, I ain't... [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3117.2s)]
*  So I just started going to the studio and just started recording songs, making music, [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3119.8s)]
*  record the album, and this is the album that we're going to release. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3124.48s)]
*  But the album had been done for like three years. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3128.2000000000003s)]
*  You know? [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3130.28s)]
*  And... [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3131.28s)]
*  Well, what's been the holdup? [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3132.28s)]
*  You don't know? [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3138.2400000000002s)]
*  So it's all on them? [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3139.88s)]
*  That's what happens when you sign the record labels. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3140.88s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3143.1200000000003s)]
*  Bro, you want to hear it? [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3144.1200000000003s)]

*  Three years? [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3149.48s)]
*  I might need another drink. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3150.48s)]
*  I think you need another drink. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3151.48s)]
*  I might need another drink, yeah. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3152.48s)]
*  All right, so check this out. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3155.48s)]
*  Danny Brown. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3158.1200000000003s)]
*  Being a regular rapper from Detroit, whatever. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3160.1600000000003s)]
*  Cheers, sir. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3161.84s)]

*  Cheers. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3163.84s)]
*  I'm not even going to go into Tony Ayo and G on that all weird shit, just to get to the [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3164.84s)]
*  point of... [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3169.6000000000004s)]
*  So I remember being... [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3170.6000000000004s)]
*  This festival in New York at the time was called CMJ Festival, which was like a cool... [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3174.16s)]
*  It was like, you know, same thing as South by Southwest, where it is in Texas. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3181.08s)]
*  That's what it was for New York. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3184.44s)]
*  They had this festival, CMJ Festival. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3186.08s)]
*  And at one of these shows, they had at Brooklyn Bowl, Foosgo Records, do a show. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3188.64s)]
*  And Kanye showed up and they shut the whole shit down. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3196.92s)]
*  And I couldn't go. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3202.92s)]
*  I couldn't get in. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3204.76s)]
*  And to me, I was like, man, Foosgo Records, they like to... [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3205.76s)]
*  If I could ever be cool with Foosgo Records, whatever I can do to be down with Foosgo Records, [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3210.16s)]
*  I would do. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3217.08s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3218.08s)]
*  Type of shit. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3219.08s)]
*  So then, shit goes on. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3220.08s)]
*  I end up getting in a situation. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3221.08s)]
*  I started talking to Foosgo. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3226.08s)]
*  And I don't think they were really into signing me at the time. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3229.6000000000004s)]
*  But Q-Tip from a tribe called Quest was real close with A-Track, who's one of the owners [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3234.6000000000004s)]
*  of Foosgo. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3241.0800000000004s)]
*  And they hung out. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3242.0800000000004s)]
*  And A-Track was like, man, we're thinking about signing Danny Brown. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3244.96s)]
*  And Q-Tip was like, nigga, thinkin'. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3249.92s)]
*  Are you retarded? [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3253.32s)]
*  Like, this is one of the illest things. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3254.32s)]
*  And he broke it down to him, like, what makes me so ill? [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3257.16s)]
*  Which I can... [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3260.32s)]
*  We can talk about that. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3261.32s)]
*  That has to be nice. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3262.32s)]
*  No, I'm literally like, super ill. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3263.32s)]
*  When it comes to rap, it's like cheatin'. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3265.2s)]
*  I'm like, steroid. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3267.96s)]
*  It's super ill. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3268.96s)]
*  I can cheat. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3269.96s)]
*  It's super ill. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3270.96s)]
*  So then, he was like, fuck it. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3271.96s)]
*  Yeah, I'm gonna sign it. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3274.96s)]
*  So then I already knew I was gonna get signed to Foosgo. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3277.56s)]
*  We already had this to each other. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3279.8s)]
*  So it was no negotiation on what the shit was. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3281.6s)]
*  So I was going to interviews already. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3286.66s)]
*  Like I would do an interview and they'd be like, what's gonna happen? [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3288.7799999999997s)]
*  And I'd be like, oh, I'm signing to Foosgo. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3290.66s)]
*  So, boom. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3293.04s)]
*  To say that, we signed a contract. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3294.04s)]
*  I signed for $5,000. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3296.74s)]
*  Literally, $5,000. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3298.74s)]
*  And it was South by Southwest happening the next week. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3300.74s)]
*  And I had like two shows. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3305.42s)]
*  So I literally spent the entire signing bonus at South by Southwest the next week. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3307.2999999999997s)]
*  So I had no money. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3313.06s)]
*  Super broke. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3314.06s)]
*  Whatever the fuck. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3315.06s)]
*  I'm living off my girl. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3316.46s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3318.46s)]
*  Her banking on me, making it as a rapper kind of situation. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3321.2599999999998s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3325.06s)]
*  We do whatever we do. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3327.46s)]
*  We get that. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3329.2799999999997s)]
*  But then the album comes out. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3330.2799999999997s)]
*  And at the time, no one really thought about the album. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3332.9s)]
*  I would think no one, I did. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3336.7799999999997s)]
*  But at that time, no one thought that the album would be like a big deal. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3339.98s)]
*  But then the album would come out at one fucking album of the year in Spin Magazine. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3346.02s)]
*  It ended up being one of the best albums I ever had in my career. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3350.9s)]
*  But when you think about it, it's like a person back against the wall. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3354.5s)]
*  When you listen to the album, I'm back against the wall. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3358.2200000000003s)]
*  And the whole concept of the album is, you know, rap music is all about being young. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3361.66s)]
*  20 year olds. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3367.98s)]
*  The whole album is called 30. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3368.98s)]
*  This is an album about a 30 year old rapper just now starting to get a break in how he [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3371.34s)]
*  feels. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3377.9s)]
*  You know? [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3378.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3379.9s)]
*  So yeah. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3380.9s)]
*  And the album did good. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3381.9s)]
*  It did good. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3382.9s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3383.9s)]
*  It did good. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3384.9s)]
*  It did good. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3385.9s)]
*  I'm saying that like sales-wise or anything like that, but culturally. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3386.9s)]
*  It did good. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3390.9s)]
*  It got recognition. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3393.1400000000003s)]
*  So I was able to get a lot of shit from that. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3394.94s)]
*  You know, I got a lot of deals and signed a lot of shit. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3398.94s)]
*  And then my next album after that was old. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3401.94s)]
*  It's called old. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3405.3s)]
*  But that charted at Billboard. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3407.7000000000003s)]
*  But it was a lot of money. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3409.46s)]
*  Like I spent, like it was a lot of money spent in that. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3410.86s)]
*  I say that to say this, okay. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3414.34s)]
*  As me as a kid from Detroit, got good at rap. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3417.1s)]
*  All right. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3422.34s)]
*  I know how to rap. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3423.34s)]
*  A record label signs me. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3424.34s)]
*  I rap for this record label. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3426.6600000000003s)]
*  I make an album. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3428.42s)]
*  In my head, as when you start to make music, you want to be as experimental and to be you [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3431.9s)]
*  as much as possible. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3439.82s)]
*  You don't understand this, the thing called music business. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3441.1800000000003s)]
*  So you're not thinking about business. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3443.98s)]
*  You're just thinking about art. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3445.62s)]
*  I'm just trying to make the best. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3446.86s)]
*  Me, Illmatic was the greatest album I ever heard in my life. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3448.98s)]
*  So to me it's like Illmatic and other one is Cannibal Box, Colvane. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3453.78s)]
*  So to me it's like I'm trying to make albums to mirror those. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3459.2200000000003s)]
*  I'm just trying to like, as me as a rapper, as an artist or musician, just trying to like [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3463.1800000000003s)]
*  shit that I was influenced by, like trying to make a piece of art that could stand next [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3468.94s)]
*  to that. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3473.26s)]
*  You hear what I'm saying? [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3474.26s)]
*  But at this point in life, that shit don't matter no more. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3475.26s)]
*  Because there's too much money to be made behind this shit. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3478.5400000000004s)]
*  You hear what I'm saying? [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3482.34s)]
*  I didn't care about this shit. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3484.34s)]
*  And then now... [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3485.6600000000003s)]
*  So do you think that by trying to make something that stands next to that, somehow or another [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3488.6600000000003s)]
*  you'll lose money? [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3494.94s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3496.7400000000002s)]
*  How come? [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3497.7400000000002s)]
*  Because time changed. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3498.7400000000002s)]
*  Time changes how? [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3500.2200000000003s)]
*  The shit that we liked in 1994 or we don't like it in 2004. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3501.2200000000003s)]
*  I still do. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3504.78s)]
*  I think there's a lot of people that still do. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3505.78s)]
*  Yeah, we do. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3506.78s)]
*  But we got to think about the kids. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3507.78s)]
*  Dude, I still listen to Cool G Rap. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3508.78s)]
*  Have you listened to Playboy Cardi? [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3511.7000000000003s)]
*  No. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3513.26s)]
*  See? [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3514.26s)]

*  I don't have enough time. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3518.26s)]
*  Playboy Cardi can shut down this whole shit. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3519.26s)]
*  I'm being honest with you. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3523.26s)]
*  Can we play some of it? [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3525.26s)]

*  Why? [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3541.26s)]
*  This is my Joe Rogan interview. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3542.26s)]
*  Okay. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3543.26s)]
*  Let him know about the fucking game Playboy. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3544.26s)]
*  It's not going to hurt you if he gets a little love. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3547.26s)]
*  All right. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3550.26s)]

*  Help me out. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3573.26s)]
*  My music is like stand-up comedy in that sense. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3574.26s)]
*  Oh, you want to hear some of my stand-up comedy rap? [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3577.26s)]

*  We'll do that. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3582.26s)]
*  We don't have to... [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3583.26s)]
*  Bitch, the only thing you got to know, my dick touch the ground when I'm sitting down on [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3584.26s)]
*  the floor. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3589.26s)]
*  See, that's the thing about rap. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3590.26s)]
*  Like, you know me, I was into comedy, so I took my whole shit from comedy to where I [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3591.26s)]
*  were wrapped. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3599.26s)]
*  What I would do, I would just sit around and write punch lines all the time. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3600.26s)]
*  So I write punch lines. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3605.26s)]
*  So think about this. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3607.1000000000004s)]
*  Look, I'm about to give y'all niggas the game. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3608.1000000000004s)]
*  So 16 bars of verse. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3610.0400000000004s)]
*  It's four punch... [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3612.26s)]
*  It's four lines, four verse. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3613.7000000000003s)]
*  So let's just say if I sit around, I listen to a Joe Rogan episode, someone says an ill [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3616.3s)]
*  punch line on there. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3620.7000000000003s)]
*  Uncle Joey, he might say some crazy shit. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3621.98s)]
*  Like, ugh. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3624.3s)]
*  You get what I'm saying? [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3625.3s)]
*  Just some crazy shit. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3626.3s)]
*  A line. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3627.3s)]
*  Just one line. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3628.3s)]
*  Just one line. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3629.34s)]
*  It's 16 bars. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3630.34s)]
*  So one line could create four bars. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3632.5800000000004s)]
*  So every line I get four bars. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3636.1400000000003s)]
*  So I need four lines to give me a 16. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3638.1000000000004s)]
*  Mmm. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3641.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3642.3s)]
*  No, no. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3643.3s)]
*  You know, the first time I ever did Coke was Coachella. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3644.3s)]
*  How long ago? [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3648.1800000000003s)]

*  So she wanted to have a girlfriend. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3665.78s)]
*  She's like, pick my girlfriend type shit. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3668.82s)]
*  So I found her girlfriend and I found her and it was this type of bitch. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3670.9s)]
*  They loved each other. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3674.5400000000004s)]
*  They kicked with each other. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3675.5400000000004s)]
*  They did. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3677.1800000000003s)]
*  They went on fucking vacations and all type of shit. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3678.1800000000003s)]
*  They did all type of shit together. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3680.78s)]
*  And then I'm playing Coachella. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3682.26s)]

*  Get me up about the mushrooms and like whatever. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3828.28s)]
*  I saw about a quarter pound of mushrooms. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3831.0400000000004s)]
*  Jesus, don't tell the people. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3833.4s)]

*  It's a good amount of time. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3838.1200000000003s)]
*  It probably changed a lot at the end of that month. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3840.84s)]
*  It made me worse. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3844.0400000000004s)]
*  Worse? [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3845.0400000000004s)]
*  How so? [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3846.0400000000004s)]
*  Because, I don't know. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3847.0400000000004s)]
*  Me taking the mushrooms, I did it, bro. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3850.0400000000004s)]
*  I did a lot. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3853.48s)]
*  How did it make you worse? [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3854.48s)]
*  I was clean at that time. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3858.1600000000003s)]
*  Everybody talk about how mushrooms could keep you from drinking. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3859.6400000000003s)]
*  When I started doing mushrooms, for some reason it made me tell me that drinking wasn't bad. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3864.4s)]
*  You can drink. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3870.2000000000003s)]
*  You can handle it. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3871.2000000000003s)]
*  Then I started drinking. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3872.2000000000003s)]
*  Then I started drinking. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3873.2000000000003s)]
*  Then they said, I know, I'm doing coke again. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3874.2000000000003s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3877.0s)]
*  So I blame it all on mushrooms. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3879.2000000000003s)]
*  Because I was clean as fuck before I started doing the mushrooms. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3882.42s)]
*  For how long? [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3885.2000000000003s)]
*  Months. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3886.2000000000003s)]
*  Like two months. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3888.0s)]
*  All I'm going to say is two months is my limit. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3889.0s)]
*  After eight weeks then it's fucked up. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3893.16s)]
*  There's a thing that does happen when you do mushrooms. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3895.3599999999997s)]
*  It alleviates some of your anxiety. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3898.3999999999996s)]
*  Maybe people have some anxiety about addictions. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3901.16s)]
*  Maybe they're not over it and they still have anxiety about it. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3905.52s)]
*  Mushrooms alleviate that anxiety sometimes. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3909.04s)]
*  What is an addiction, man? [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3911.9199999999996s)]
*  What would make you want to drink? [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3913.2s)]
*  It's a weird thing that goes on in a person's mind. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3916.08s)]
*  No, an addiction to me, and I can say that for mine. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3918.08s)]
*  I don't know of any people. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3920.8s)]
*  Addiction for me is an escape. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3923.12s)]
*  I've been through so much in my life. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3925.12s)]
*  Even this and that. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3927.96s)]
*  Even now, my fucking aunt passed. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3928.96s)]
*  And it is what it is. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3932.88s)]
*  I will say, man, that's what I try to tell you about me and my music career. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3936.84s)]
*  My family, they look at me like I'm the richest motherfucker in the world. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3943.04s)]
*  And if I can tell them that, no. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3948.04s)]
*  Have you ever heard a Danny Brown song on the radio? [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3951.04s)]
*  Have you ever seen a... [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3955.04s)]
*  No! [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3958.04s)]
*  But to them, you've got to think, Detroit. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3959.04s)]
*  Just the fact that I've made it in music and I'm someone. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3961.04s)]
*  This and that. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3965.04s)]
*  I should be able to... [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3966.04s)]
*  And I don't. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3968.04s)]
*  I don't have it. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3969.04s)]
*  I can be the first person to tell you. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3970.04s)]
*  Music put me more into debt than if I didn't do it. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3972.04s)]
*  Do you get what I'm saying? [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3979.04s)]
*  Yes. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3981.04s)]
*  So my first album that I had... [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3982.04s)]
*  Well, not saying my first album, but with Triple X. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3986.04s)]
*  But Triple X did good and they gave it to all these people. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3989.04s)]
*  Boom, boom, these artists, they did good. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3991.04s)]
*  And then I did old. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3993.04s)]
*  Old did good. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3995.04s)]
*  Did that. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3996.04s)]
*  Boom, boom, boom. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3997.04s)]
*  They charted Billboard. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3998.04s)]
*  Boom, boom, boom. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=3999.04s)]
*  So now I was a free agent at that point. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4000.04s)]
*  So now I had these record labels, all of them courting me. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4003.04s)]
*  Boom, boom. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4006.04s)]
*  I signed to Warp. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4007.04s)]
*  Warp gave me a fucking damn near quarter million dollar fucking budget to make an album. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4009.04s)]
*  But you think I did. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4016.04s)]
*  Spent it all? [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4018.04s)]
*  Spent every last... [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4019.04s)]
*  Nigga, before you know it, I was asking for more money. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4021.04s)]
*  So I went crazy, made a fucking quarter million... [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4025.04s)]
*  Whatever the fuck. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4030.04s)]
*  Spent all the money I could possibly spend on this fucking album to make the best possible album that I make. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4031.04s)]
*  And now this album has been made, I don't feel bad about it. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4036.04s)]
*  Have you... [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4043.04s)]
*  That's great. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4044.04s)]
*  When you get a spare time to yourself, Joe Rogan... [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4045.04s)]
*  Fuck yeah. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4048.04s)]
*  Atrocity Exhibition. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4049.04s)]
*  Can I play it right now? [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4051.04s)]
*  No, that's the... [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4053.04s)]
*  Jonah Hill, he shot one of the videos. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4055.04s)]
*  Oh, he made a music video for it? [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4059.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4061.04s)]
*  Really? [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4062.04s)]
*  Jonah Hill, yeah. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4063.04s)]
*  He shot the video for the second single. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4064.04s)]
*  Ain't it funny? [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4066.04s)]
*  I talk about that all the time. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4067.04s)]
*  Even that. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4068.04s)]
*  Even shooting that video was such a fucking crazy situation. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4069.04s)]
*  So was Jonah Hill like the director of it? [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4072.04s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4074.04s)]
*  That's amazing. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4075.04s)]
*  Nigga, he was the budgeter. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4076.04s)]
*  No one wanted to shoot... [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4078.04s)]
*  Can we play it? [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4079.04s)]
*  Oh. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4080.04s)]
*  Here? [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4081.04s)]
*  All right, go ahead. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4082.04s)]
*  Physical attention from older men makes me feel validated. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4083.04s)]
*  I'm empty inside. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4088.04s)]

*  Kids rock! [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4112.04s)]
*  When you ever seen a rap video look like this? [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4117.04s)]
*  How did a nigga get Gus Van Zink, though? [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4120.04s)]
*  I'm smoking meth. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4125.04s)]

*  I'm so into it. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4145.04s)]
*  Danny, I love it. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4147.04s)]
*  Danny, get down from there. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4178.04s)]
*  Why are you doing this, Danny? [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4184.04s)]
*  I've been destroyed. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4186.04s)]
*  And if I destroy it, maybe I'll feel okay. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4187.04s)]
*  None of us feel okay. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4191.04s)]
*  Oh, Uncle Danny. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4195.04s)]
*  No way to mess it. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4200.04s)]
*  Jesus Christ! [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4201.04s)]
*  That shit is amazing. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4203.04s)]
*  That's amazing. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4205.04s)]
*  That's really good. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4207.04s)]
*  What year was this? [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4209.04s)]
*  2019. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4211.04s)]
*  Don't show anybody this, bro. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4213.04s)]
*  2017. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4215.04s)]
*  But no, that's the thing. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4217.04s)]
*  So, being a musician, being a rapper. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4219.04s)]
*  It's not just that. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4223.04s)]
*  It's all the visuals. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4225.04s)]
*  It's very disturbing, very crazy, very funny. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4227.04s)]
*  But that's artistic freedom. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4229.04s)]
*  But you don't get props like that no more for that kind of shit. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4231.04s)]
*  You're gonna. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4233.04s)]
*  Trust me. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4235.04s)]
*  It's really good. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4237.04s)]
*  When I'm dead? [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4239.04s)]
*  Does that count? [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4241.04s)]
*  Tell me you haven't gotten more people paying attention to your music now that you started doing podcasts. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4243.04s)]
*  Fuck no. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4245.04s)]
*  No? [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4247.04s)]
*  Let's see what happens after this one. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4249.04s)]
*  Alright, well tell them. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4251.04s)]
*  Let me know what happens after this one. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4253.04s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4255.04s)]
*  So would you know? [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4257.04s)]
*  In terms of streamings and downloads? [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4259.04s)]
*  No, yeah. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4261.04s)]
*  I definitely, cause I'm super on that. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4263.04s)]
*  But no, the thing is about is that [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4265.04s)]
*  I just don't [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4267.04s)]
*  judge it like that. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4269.04s)]
*  I look at it like what I've done good. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4271.04s)]
*  To what you think, like that's good. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4273.04s)]
*  I like that one. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4275.04s)]
*  No, that was amazing. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4277.04s)]
*  I'm super proud of that. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4279.04s)]
*  So now is what I'm doing next. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4281.04s)]
*  The new album that I have. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4283.04s)]
*  I'm gonna talk about it. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4285.04s)]
*  This is gonna happen. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4287.04s)]
*  Look. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4289.04s)]
*  It's called Cuaranta. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4291.04s)]
*  What does that mean? [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4293.04s)]
*  40. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4295.04s)]
*  In Spanish. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4297.04s)]
*  That album you listened to [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4299.04s)]
*  was XXX. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4301.04s)]
*  30. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4303.04s)]
*  So, Cuaranta. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4305.04s)]
*  I like it. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4307.04s)]
*  Oh, it's so good. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4309.04s)]
*  It's so good. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4311.04s)]
*  What is it coming out? [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4313.04s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4315.04s)]
*  Hopefully this Joe Rogan episode [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4317.04s)]
*  makes it happen faster. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4319.04s)]
*  Why have they been holding on to it? [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4321.04s)]
*  What's the hold up? [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4323.04s)]
*  There's no discussion? [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4325.04s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4327.04s)]
*  You haven't gotten any response? [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4329.04s)]
*  Have you had a conversation about it? [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4331.04s)]
*  See how it happens? [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4333.04s)]
*  Is it possible to be independent now? [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4335.04s)]
*  You know what it made me feel like? [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4337.04s)]
*  It made me feel like [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4339.04s)]
*  maybe they're not happy with the album. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4341.04s)]
*  So I should make more songs. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4343.04s)]
*  So I've been making songs [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4345.04s)]
*  and constantly making songs for the past [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4347.04s)]
*  2-3 years. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4349.04s)]
*  And now [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4351.04s)]
*  I get the actual final track list [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4353.04s)]
*  of what the album is gonna be. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4355.04s)]
*  Bro, it's nothing. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4357.04s)]
*  I've been wasting my time making those new songs. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4359.04s)]
*  And it's new songs that I love [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4361.04s)]
*  that I want [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4363.04s)]
*  to be out on this. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4365.04s)]
*  But [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4367.04s)]
*  when I do listen [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4369.04s)]
*  to the album that they picked [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4371.04s)]
*  I realize [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4373.04s)]
*  why they are a record company. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4375.04s)]
*  And it's a good job. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4377.04s)]
*  And you think they did a good job? [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4379.04s)]
*  Oh, amazing job. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4381.04s)]
*  Sometimes you need an editor, right? [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4383.04s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4385.04s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4387.04s)]
*  I'm not about to even talk shit about [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4389.04s)]
*  them and be bad about it because [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4391.04s)]
*  they do. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4393.04s)]
*  Apex twins, man. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4395.04s)]
*  Apex [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4397.04s)]
*  twins, bro. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4399.04s)]

*  I already did it. I've been there. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4517.04s)]
*  I know how to talk on stage, [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4519.04s)]
*  and I just don't have a routine. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4521.04s)]
*  Yeah, well, like I said, [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4523.04s)]

*  All right, even... [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4547.04s)]
*  I did my rap shoot. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4549.04s)]
*  I've been a rapper, and so much. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4551.04s)]
*  And being a rapper. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4553.04s)]
*  But I remember it was a time in being a rapper [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4555.04s)]
*  and like... [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4557.04s)]
*  And your teacher asked you what you wanted to be when you grow up. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4559.04s)]
*  And I would say it, being a rapper, [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4561.04s)]
*  and everybody would laugh at me. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4563.04s)]
*  And then it still got to the point where I'd be like, [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4565.04s)]
*  I'm not a rapper anymore. I said a comedian. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4567.04s)]

*  I go to places with like 10 dudes behind a glass wall [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4715.04s)]
*  fake laughing and pressing buttons. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4717.04s)]
*  It's terrible. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4719.04s)]
*  Fucking terrible. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4721.04s)]
*  No, I'm not. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4723.04s)]
*  You said it. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4725.04s)]
*  This is literally what it is. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4727.04s)]
*  This is it. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4729.04s)]
*  This is what it's supposed to be. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4731.04s)]
*  But that's what I was telling you about you could do your show on FaceTime. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4733.04s)]
*  You could just point your fucking camera at you. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4735.04s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4737.04s)]
*  It's what you say. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4739.04s)]
*  No, but I still owe something to time. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4741.04s)]
*  Oh yeah, for sure. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4743.04s)]
*  I don't want to make no moves without them. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4745.04s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4747.04s)]
*  No, you shouldn't. And they'll be with you 100%. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4749.04s)]
*  So if they want to, if I wanted to like do something outside of that, [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4751.04s)]
*  then I would want them to still be involved in it. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4755.04s)]
*  If you were doing something with some like [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4757.04s)]
*  fucking fake podcast network, [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4759.04s)]
*  you know, like there's [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4761.04s)]
*  What do you mean a fake podcast? [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4763.04s)]
*  I'm with the real shit. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4765.04s)]
*  You are. Which is I'm saying is great. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4767.04s)]
*  But if you were with another, there's some networks out there that are only [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4769.04s)]
*  Why? Why? [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4771.04s)]
*  Why do I need to be with any of that? [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4773.04s)]
*  I'm not saying you, man. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4775.04s)]
*  What I'm trying to say is your situation is amazing. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4777.04s)]
*  But there's other people out there that get into a bad situation. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4779.04s)]
*  And they get locked into these companies [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4781.04s)]
*  and they find out these companies own 50% of their podcasts forever. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4783.04s)]
*  And they're like, what the fuck? [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4785.04s)]
*  With no investment. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4787.04s)]
*  Like there was a lot of shady people [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4789.04s)]
*  that got involved in podcasting. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4791.04s)]
*  When podcasting started getting monetized. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4793.04s)]
*  I never looked at podcast [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4795.04s)]
*  for like a money [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4797.04s)]
*  type of situation. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4799.04s)]
*  Well, the problem is other companies do. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4801.04s)]
*  I see that, yeah. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4803.04s)]
*  Some companies do. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4805.04s)]
*  No, now it's a lot of money involved in this shit. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4807.04s)]
*  But I just [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4809.04s)]
*  Because I feel like me [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4811.04s)]
*  showing up, like me right now, [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4813.04s)]
*  talking to you, I would do this for free. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4815.04s)]
*  I would do it for free too. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4817.04s)]
*  That's the beauty of doing a podcast. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4819.04s)]
*  So I feel bad [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4821.04s)]
*  that someone would pay. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4823.04s)]
*  The problem with these [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4825.04s)]
*  like what I'm saying about these podcast networks [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4827.04s)]
*  is they're not really providing anything. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4829.04s)]
*  They might be providing [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4831.04s)]
*  production, they might be providing a studio. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4833.04s)]
*  But without content [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4835.04s)]
*  they don't have anything. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4837.04s)]
*  And if they're taking half of it [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4839.04s)]
*  and you're creating the content, which can happen, [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4841.04s)]
*  that's a crazy deal. And then they own it forever? [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4843.04s)]
*  Get the fuck out of here. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4845.04s)]
*  Forever. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4847.04s)]
*  Get the fuck out of here. And I've seen those deals before. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4849.04s)]
*  And I've also seen a lot of comics [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4851.04s)]
*  when they're getting signed to like agents [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4853.04s)]
*  and like kind of shitty manager types. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4855.04s)]
*  The manager type will try to take a percentage [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4857.04s)]
*  of the podcast too. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4859.04s)]
*  So they own a piece of your shit [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4861.04s)]
*  as long as you're doing it. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4863.04s)]
*  So that was the whole shit that I'm trying to tell you. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4865.04s)]
*  Like me doing what... [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4867.04s)]

*  to do like a podcast. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4875.04s)]
*  If I would have did it on my own [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4877.04s)]
*  I wouldn't be talking to you right now. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4879.04s)]
*  You might be. But the point is you haven't. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4881.04s)]
*  You did it with them which is perfect. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=4883.04s)]

*  And to [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=5883.04s)]
*  go to the whole other world. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=5885.04s)]
*  This and that and that. But [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=5887.04s)]
*  I think that's [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=5889.04s)]
*  now where shit are [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=5891.04s)]
*  starting to [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=5893.04s)]
*  with metaverses and [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=5895.04s)]
*  shit is starting to collide a little bit. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=5897.04s)]

*  That's inevitable. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=5901.04s)]
*  That us going into some [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=5903.04s)]
*  virtual world is inevitable. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=5905.04s)]
*  It's probably just a natural progression [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=5907.04s)]
*  of what consciousness does. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=5909.04s)]
*  When it can control technology [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=5911.04s)]
*  to a certain point. It probably gets to a certain point [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=5913.04s)]
*  then it creates an artificial technology. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=5915.04s)]
*  Just how long is it gonna take? [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=5917.04s)]
*  Is it gonna take a hundred years before we're all doing it? [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=5919.04s)]
*  Or two hundred years? But we're gonna be [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=5921.04s)]
*  plugged in like the fucking Matrix. I think it's three years. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=5923.04s)]
*  It might be. I don't know. And about three years [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=5925.04s)]
*  is our metaverse. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=5927.04s)]
*  But the metaverse itself [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=5929.04s)]
*  I was reading something about [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=5931.04s)]
*  how meta's stock is down. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=5933.04s)]
*  Because of all this investment in [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=5935.04s)]
*  the metaverse right? Isn't that [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=5937.04s)]
*  what's going on? That could probably [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=5939.04s)]
*  also be because their metaverse is [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=5941.04s)]
*  different from what everybody else wanted. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=5943.04s)]
*  They're trying to make their own thing. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=5945.04s)]

*  10,000 hours. Yeah. Oh I definitely [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6711.04s)]
*  think over 10,000 hours [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6713.04s)]
*  when it comes to rap. Don't you think that's the case [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6715.04s)]
*  with anything? [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6717.04s)]
*  I think that's probably the case with everything. To get [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6719.04s)]
*  good at it. You got to really put in [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6721.04s)]
*  time. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6723.04s)]
*  So that's what we're talking about. That's what we're talking about. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6725.04s)]
*  Yeah. But I think you have a head [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6727.04s)]
*  start because I think some of your [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6729.04s)]
*  hours already count. So [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6731.04s)]
*  you're transferring your education from a different school. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6733.04s)]
*  So me doing this podcast, I'm [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6735.04s)]
*  going to do the podcast and then just hang around with someone [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6737.04s)]

*  And you got to look at it like this. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6761.04s)]
*  Let's just say [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6763.04s)]
*  I'm a rapper. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6765.04s)]
*  I haven't had the most rap career. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6767.04s)]
*  Like I don't fucking [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6769.04s)]

*  I don't sell records. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6773.04s)]
*  You get what I'm saying? Yeah. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6775.04s)]
*  Like every album I put out has [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6777.04s)]
*  sold less records [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6779.04s)]
*  every time. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6781.04s)]
*  And then you know why is that? [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6783.04s)]
*  Because I never [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6785.04s)]
*  you know how they say like [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6787.04s)]
*  a person like [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6789.04s)]
*  if you don't change anything that you do [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6791.04s)]
*  you like retard it. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6793.04s)]
*  Like insane. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6795.04s)]
*  Every album that I made is the same album. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6797.04s)]
*  In some sense. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6799.04s)]
*  But I'm just [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6801.04s)]
*  tinkering with what [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6803.04s)]
*  I thought was bad the last [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6805.04s)]
*  album and just trying to make a better album [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6807.04s)]
*  with every album. So I'm not [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6809.04s)]
*  going over means. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6813.04s)]
*  You know? I'm just trying to beat [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6815.04s)]
*  what I did last time. Right. And I do it [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6817.04s)]
*  every time. Which is great. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6819.04s)]
*  So what are you trying to say? [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6821.04s)]
*  That's not enough. That's not enough. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6823.04s)]
*  Why is that? [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6825.04s)]
*  In the world of rap music we'll be [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6827.04s)]
*  dealing with. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6829.04s)]
*  You know? I just gave you that [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6833.04s)]
*  whole theory of that. No I get [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6835.04s)]
*  the theory. I'm the Patrice O'Neal [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6837.04s)]
*  of this rap shit. Can you be independent [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6839.04s)]
*  as a rap artist now? [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6841.04s)]
*  Is it possible to not be [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6843.04s)]
*  involved in a record deal with a company? [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6845.04s)]
*  Yeah. If you believe in yourself [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6847.04s)]
*  that much. But we need the money [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6849.04s)]
*  from the record companies to make us keep going. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6851.04s)]
*  So that's what the record [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6853.04s)]
*  companies are doing. They're providing the initial [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6855.04s)]
*  investment that gets you going. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6857.04s)]
*  Yeah. So but [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6859.04s)]
*  at the end of the day when they give you the initial [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6861.04s)]
*  investment all they do is tie you in. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6863.04s)]
*  So let's put it like this. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6865.04s)]
*  Okay. Danny Brown. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6867.04s)]
*  No one [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6869.04s)]
*  I didn't have a record deal. I made all this shit [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6871.04s)]
*  off my own shit. Boom. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6873.04s)]
*  Made one of the Illegit Rap albums. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6875.04s)]
*  I get all the crazies. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6877.04s)]
*  Because [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6879.04s)]
*  my whole shit was about reviews. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6881.04s)]
*  You feel me? [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6883.04s)]
*  It's not what people say about when you go [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6885.04s)]
*  on Metacritic. And you see all [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6887.04s)]
*  the reviews add up. What that review [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6889.04s)]
*  add up? So my whole shit was about [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6891.04s)]

*  world. I mean like who [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6955.04s)]

*  If you think you can do it you can do it. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6961.04s)]
*  No. But who else get this chance? [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6963.04s)]
*  Like you can be a rapper. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6965.04s)]
*  And a lot of times I think [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6967.04s)]
*  about me being a rapper. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6969.04s)]
*  Is that just because the environment [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6971.04s)]
*  that I grew up in? [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6973.04s)]
*  Who says I was a rapper? [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6975.04s)]
*  I just literally lived in fucking [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6977.04s)]
*  the hood and that was the [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6979.04s)]
*  coolest shit to do. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6981.04s)]
*  I could do comedy then. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6983.04s)]
*  But it wasn't a cool thing to push [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6985.04s)]
*  comedy for me at that. Right. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6987.04s)]
*  You get what I'm saying? But everybody was cool with me being [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6989.04s)]
*  a rapper. So I just got... [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6991.04s)]
*  Do you think if there was comedy, if it was a cool thing to do comedy [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6993.04s)]
*  you would do that? Yes. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6995.04s)]
*  100%. There you go. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6997.04s)]
*  100%. Cause even they got to the point where I remember [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=6999.04s)]
*  you know when your teacher asked you what you [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7003.04s)]
*  want to be when you grow up type shit? [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7005.04s)]
*  And I would say I'll rap. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7007.04s)]
*  I want to be a rapper. And the class would laugh at me. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7009.04s)]
*  So it got to the point [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7011.04s)]
*  where I stopped saying I wanted to be a rapper. [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7013.04s)]
*  And I would say I wanted to be a stand up comedian. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7015.04s)]
*  And the class didn't laugh at me anymore. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7017.04s)]
*  But then the teacher [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7019.04s)]
*  asked me to do stand up [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7021.04s)]
*  community shit and I didn't have. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7023.04s)]
*  Cause I remember one time [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7025.04s)]
*  the teacher asked me like we had like a [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7027.04s)]
*  some type of like a holiday [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7031.04s)]
*  a holiday like [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7033.04s)]
*  you know [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7035.04s)]
*  program we got to put on for this shit. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7037.04s)]
*  You know like a Christmas program and shit? [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7039.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7041.04s)]
*  And I had like a [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7043.04s)]
*  like a poetry thing that I was going to do. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7045.04s)]
*  And this shit. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7047.04s)]
*  And I remember just reading this shit and I was like man this shit. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7049.04s)]
*  Whack. [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7051.04s)]
*  Like I can rap. Like I knew me to myself [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7053.04s)]
*  like reading the poems and shit. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7055.04s)]
*  I can rap like I can make some [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7057.04s)]
*  ill shit way better than this. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7059.04s)]
*  So instead of me like [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7061.04s)]
*  so we would and I had to do the poems [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7063.04s)]
*  instead of me doing the actual poems [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7065.04s)]
*  I was supposed to do. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7067.04s)]
*  I just started just doing random raps. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7069.04s)]
*  And then the whole class like [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7071.04s)]
*  the school everybody like [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7073.04s)]
*  they just went nuts like oh [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7075.04s)]
*  like applauding for me [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7077.04s)]
*  and shit. And I was like damn [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7079.04s)]
*  you know like that's probably what I [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7081.04s)]
*  should be doing then. Like I'd probably be a rapper. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7083.04s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7085.04s)]
*  So I just kept just rapping. [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7087.04s)]
*  Like even that. Like I was [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7089.04s)]
*  I'd rap the entire time. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7091.04s)]
*  Like I would go to school like being in like middle school [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7093.04s)]
*  like sixth grade or whatever fuck. [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7095.04s)]
*  No one knew I'd rap. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7097.04s)]
*  It'd be always one kid [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7099.04s)]
*  that would pop up and try to like rap. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7101.04s)]
*  Be a rapper. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7103.04s)]
*  And I'd just be like [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7105.04s)]
*  just sitting in a corner to myself like [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7107.04s)]
*  and this would be like my time to shine. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7109.04s)]
*  And I would fucking just bite him. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7111.04s)]
*  Every time. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7113.04s)]
*  But from that one day it would make me the most popular [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7115.04s)]
*  kid in school. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7117.04s)]
*  Instantly. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7119.04s)]
*  Literally happened like [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7121.04s)]
*  bro [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7123.04s)]
*  every year in school. [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7125.04s)]
*  Like I would literally [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7127.04s)]
*  shut up the whole year. One time [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7129.04s)]
*  some rapping came up. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7131.04s)]
*  I'd bust a rap. And then the whole [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7133.04s)]
*  entire school looked at me different. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7135.04s)]
*  How many kids in your grade tried [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7137.04s)]
*  rapping? [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7139.04s)]
*  Probably like three or four of us. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7141.04s)]
*  Because I actually learned how to write a rap. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7143.04s)]
*  Was from one of my [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7145.04s)]
*  like [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7147.04s)]
*  Kevin Willis. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7149.04s)]
*  He had all the hockey jerseys. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7151.04s)]
*  Can you imagine that? [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7153.04s)]
*  No niggas. We don't watch hockey. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7155.04s)]
*  But this nigga would show up [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7157.04s)]
*  like on some like throwback [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7159.04s)]
*  shit. Like he had all the evil hockey jerseys. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7161.04s)]
*  But his brother rap. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7163.04s)]
*  And his brother used to rap [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7165.04s)]
*  in his notebook. And one day [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7167.04s)]
*  he showed me his notebook. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7169.04s)]
*  And I saw the way the [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7171.04s)]
*  format of how he wrote rap. [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7173.04s)]
*  So like, and you want to hear the fuck [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7175.04s)]
*  up part about it. It's kind of like comedy. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7177.04s)]
*  Because it's all about stand up. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7179.04s)]
*  It's all about like set up set up punch line. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7181.04s)]
*  Set up set up punch line. [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7183.04s)]
*  You get what I'm saying? [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7185.04s)]
*  You set up set up. So [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7187.04s)]
*  I learned that from that. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7189.04s)]
*  That's why even when y'all talk about [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7191.04s)]
*  comedy like I can do it. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7193.04s)]

*  too many people get just lucky as me. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7237.04s)]

*  understand is just [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7321.04s)]
*  cause I'm I think I [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7323.04s)]
*  love the writing aspect. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7325.04s)]
*  To what part? [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7327.04s)]
*  But what do you mean? What don't you understand [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7329.04s)]
*  about it? You said the only [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7331.04s)]
*  thing I don't understand I like the writing aspect. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7333.04s)]
*  Cause the shit you [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7335.04s)]
*  write don't necessarily mean you [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7337.04s)]
*  can go on stage and it can be funny. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7339.04s)]
*  Yeah but it's an idea [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7341.04s)]
*  and then you work it out on stage. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7343.04s)]
*  Yeah no no that's what I learned. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7345.04s)]
*  But sometimes you don't. Sometimes you write it out. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7347.04s)]
*  No no that's what I learned. You have to go and [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7349.04s)]
*  just work it and then that will [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7351.04s)]
*  turn into something else. That will turn into something [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7353.04s)]
*  else. Sometimes you write something [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7355.04s)]
*  and it's good right away. It doesn't make any sense. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7357.04s)]
*  So you gotta see me. Creativity is [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7359.04s)]
*  very. I'm super green as fuck. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7361.04s)]
*  I'm sure you are. I'm a motherfucker that's [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7363.04s)]
*  only. Damn you don't have to explain this to me. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7365.04s)]
*  It's okay. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7367.04s)]
*  But I'm only taking it serious [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7369.04s)]
*  because [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7371.04s)]
*  look you time. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7373.04s)]
*  People that I really respect with this comedy shit [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7375.04s)]
*  they're like no you can do this shit. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7377.04s)]
*  And it's like bro. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7379.04s)]
*  I would be retarded not to try. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7381.04s)]
*  Not to say retarded. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7383.04s)]
*  I'm sorry. It's okay we've said that a bunch of times already. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7385.04s)]
*  I know. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7387.04s)]
*  And I hate to say that. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7389.04s)]
*  But you know what that's just like the normal slang for me. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7391.04s)]
*  Your writing thing is not much different [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7393.04s)]
*  than any other kind of writing. It's just [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7395.04s)]
*  expressing your thoughts and getting it down on [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7397.04s)]
*  print and just put it in on a computer. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7399.04s)]
*  And it really is [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7401.04s)]
*  a lot of it is about the time spent thinking about [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7403.04s)]
*  the subjects. When you're writing [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7405.04s)]
*  you have to think about these subjects. Like a lot of people [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7407.04s)]
*  like to write in their head which is great [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7409.04s)]
*  too. But when you write when you're [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7411.04s)]
*  looking at a piece of paper or when you're looking [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7413.04s)]
*  at a screen and you're typing now you're [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7415.04s)]
*  really thinking about it. And it's extra [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7417.04s)]
*  time thinking about it. Do you know how easy it [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7419.04s)]
*  is to write a rep? It's four [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7421.04s)]
*  punch lines. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7423.04s)]
*  You understand what I'm saying? Uh huh. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7425.04s)]
*  So let's just say if I come up with [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7427.04s)]
*  four punch lines. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7429.04s)]
*  I told you. So let's just say I'm hanging out [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7431.04s)]
*  any boom day I just write [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7433.04s)]
*  I hear punch lines. Your bitch [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7435.04s)]
*  sucked my dick like a Klondike. [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7437.04s)]
*  Let's say if I had that line. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7439.04s)]
*  Your bitch sucked my dick like a Klondike. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7441.04s)]
*  I write four lines [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7443.04s)]
*  three lines that come up with that and then [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7445.04s)]
*  that's the fourth line because that's the big line. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7447.04s)]
*  So [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7449.04s)]
*  your bitch sucked my dick like a Klondike. [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7451.04s)]
*  You get what I'm saying? [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7453.04s)]
*  That's common if you think about it. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7455.04s)]
*  So all I gotta do is have these [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7457.04s)]
*  all I gotta do is figure out four punch [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7459.04s)]
*  lines. And I have a [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7461.04s)]
*  verse. 16 bars of verse. [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7463.04s)]
*  So [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7465.04s)]
*  you know what I'm saying? [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7467.04s)]
*  So I would come up with these four lines [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7469.04s)]
*  write these punch lines. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7471.04s)]
*  It don't matter what the song is to it. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7473.04s)]
*  I will figure these out. [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7475.04s)]
*  I'm gonna figure out what the song is to it. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7477.04s)]
*  I will figure these out. I'm gonna figure it out. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7479.04s)]
*  Now what we come into [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7481.04s)]
*  realize is like [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7483.04s)]
*  that's what stand up comedy is. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7485.04s)]
*  So the entire time [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7487.04s)]
*  where I thought I was being a rapper and I was writing [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7489.04s)]
*  raps. Lately writing [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7491.04s)]
*  cause that's not [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7493.04s)]
*  when I talk to other rappers and [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7495.04s)]
*  they don't write raps like that. [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7497.04s)]
*  They're like nigga are you retarded? [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7499.04s)]
*  No they're like [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7501.04s)]
*  nigga I just started. You were writing stand up. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7503.04s)]
*  You were doing stand up rap. [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7505.04s)]
*  I was doing stand up the entire time and I didn't [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7507.04s)]
*  realize it. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7509.04s)]
*  All I wrote was punch. Even to [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7511.04s)]
*  bro I got up out the bed today. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7513.04s)]
*  Like last night. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7515.04s)]
*  If I hear a punch line like something that I think is [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7517.04s)]
*  funny to myself. [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7519.04s)]
*  I gotta write that down. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7521.04s)]
*  And last night it was [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7523.04s)]
*  I was talking to them about it [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7525.04s)]
*  before the last podcast. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7527.04s)]
*  It was Doubled Eggs. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7529.04s)]
*  Bro. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7531.04s)]
*  That's the most [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7533.04s)]
*  what they call double eggs. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7535.04s)]
*  Doubled Eggs. Now me I'm a person [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7537.04s)]
*  that love eggs. I'm a [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7539.04s)]
*  you gotta get your protein high if you can get it. [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7541.04s)]
*  But. [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7543.04s)]
*  Alright if we talking about abortions and this and that. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7545.04s)]
*  So these niggas are [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7547.04s)]
*  I'm just saying it's an egg. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7549.04s)]
*  Okay it's not fertilized. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7551.04s)]
*  But they took you. They scrambled you up. [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7553.04s)]
*  Then put you back into the mix. [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7555.04s)]
*  Then fed you [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7557.04s)]
*  the next. [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7559.04s)]
*  This is like the most like [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7561.04s)]
*  gruesome shit you can do to [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7563.04s)]
*  anybody is a doubled egg. [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7565.04s)]
*  Man. You gonna tell me bro [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7567.04s)]
*  you take my shell. [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7569.04s)]
*  You take me all my skin. [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7571.04s)]
*  You gonna take all this. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7573.04s)]
*  Throw some mayonnaise and some other. [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7575.04s)]
*  But do you know the [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7577.04s)]
*  deviled eggs are eggs that are not fertilized? [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7579.04s)]
*  This is not like [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7581.04s)]
*  a logical premise. Cause those [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7583.04s)]
*  eggs aren't fertilized. They can never become a chicken. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7585.04s)]
*  A fertilized egg [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7589.04s)]
*  is an egg when the rooster fucks the hen. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7591.04s)]
*  And then the egg could become [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7593.04s)]
*  a person. The egg is just a piece of protein. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7595.04s)]
*  It's never gonna be a living organism. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7597.04s)]
*  Joe. How does this [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7599.04s)]
*  change the situation? [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7601.04s)]
*  Because you're talking about gruesomely [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7603.04s)]
*  turning up what it means to be you. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7605.04s)]
*  It's a dead baby. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7607.04s)]
*  No no no it's not a dead baby. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7609.04s)]
*  It's zero potential to be a baby. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7611.04s)]
*  It's never impregnated. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7613.04s)]
*  They lay eggs every [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7615.04s)]
*  day. I have chickens. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7617.04s)]
*  So eating deviled eggs. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7619.04s)]
*  They're building a chicken coop in my house right now. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7621.04s)]
*  Eating deviled eggs is not bad. [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7623.04s)]
*  It's nothing. It's like free protein. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7625.04s)]
*  I hate you man. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7627.04s)]
*  Sorry. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7629.04s)]
*  Sorry. But that's what an egg [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7631.04s)]
*  is. But can I get my bit? [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7633.04s)]
*  The bit's not gonna work. [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7635.04s)]
*  It's okay. [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7639.04s)]
*  I get what you're going for. And if it really was [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7641.04s)]
*  you were eating babies, it makes sense. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7643.04s)]
*  But most people know that that's not [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7645.04s)]
*  really what's going on. [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7647.04s)]
*  You know what I mean? It's like one of them things where [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7649.04s)]
*  someone has to... But see that's why you need your ghost writers. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7651.04s)]
*  Well you need someone to consult with. [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7653.04s)]
*  You know sometimes you have some funny [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7655.04s)]
*  ideas and you don't realize that it's not logical. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7657.04s)]
*  Sometimes it doesn't have [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7659.04s)]
*  to be logical. Maybe a lot of people don't know. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7661.04s)]
*  You're right. You're right. Sometimes it doesn't have to be [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7663.04s)]
*  logical but... Yeah. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7665.04s)]
*  That's the one I thought was really funny. [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7667.04s)]
*  Well Danny Brown we're gonna work on some stuff [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7669.04s)]
*  then. We're gonna go over some of your material. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7671.04s)]
*  We're gonna come up with a fucking game plan. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7673.04s)]
*  We're gonna go up there in five minutes tonight. [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7675.04s)]
*  You gonna go up there? Don't tell me that cause I'm really serious about it. [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7677.04s)]
*  Why would I not tell you that? [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7679.04s)]
*  No, no. I'm really... Also I'm serious about it. [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7681.04s)]
*  No, cause... [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7683.04s)]
*  I don't know man. I think... [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7685.04s)]
*  I think comedy [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7687.04s)]
*  is like a... Like I said it's kind of [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7689.04s)]
*  gatekeeping. [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7691.04s)]
*  And the last thing they want to see [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7693.04s)]
*  is a nigga like me. [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7695.04s)]
*  That's not true. That was a rapper. If you're funny. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7697.04s)]
*  If you're funny. And get good at this shit [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7699.04s)]
*  and then blow and then be fire. [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7701.04s)]
*  I don't think... Danny you can't think like this. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7703.04s)]
*  No I don't care. [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7705.04s)]
*  But you're saying it over and over and over again. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7707.04s)]
*  Who gives a fuck about that? Oh because I've been through it. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7709.04s)]
*  But don't... [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7711.04s)]
*  Whoever's gatekeeping comedy... [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7713.04s)]
*  No I've kind of been through it. Maybe that's what it is. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7715.04s)]
*  Most comedians, most comedians, [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7717.04s)]
*  if you're killing it would be happy. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7719.04s)]
*  They would laugh. [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7721.04s)]
*  They would think this is great. Danny Brown's fucking hilarious. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7723.04s)]
*  So that's what we hope for. [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7725.04s)]
*  I hope for that too. [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7727.04s)]
*  Because [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7729.04s)]
*  I mean I love making music. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7731.04s)]

*  I would love for... [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7737.04s)]
*  I would love to be able to make music [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7739.04s)]
*  without any [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7741.04s)]
*  thinking about making any money from it. [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7743.04s)]
*  Yeah. Or something like that. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7745.04s)]
*  Or even doing comedy. Yeah. [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7747.04s)]
*  Like when I can get to the point in my life where... [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7749.04s)]
*  Because that's where it's at now. [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7751.04s)]
*  You know? Yeah. [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7753.04s)]
*  Like I have to do shit. Yeah. [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7755.04s)]
*  To fucking support myself. [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7757.04s)]
*  And I wish I didn't have that. [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7759.04s)]
*  Right. You wish you could just do whatever you enjoy [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7761.04s)]
*  and then make money off of it. Ain't that everybody else? [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7763.04s)]
*  So I can't sit around [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7765.04s)]
*  and act like it's not a big deal. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzG0sxSQaRI&t=7767.04s)]
