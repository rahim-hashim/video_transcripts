# Joe Rogan Experience #2270 - Bridget Phetasy
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [February 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6.0s)]
*  This is the thing is no one's happy with just being like a little successful. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=10.0s)]
*  You get a little successful and then they want to get more. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=17.0s)]
*  Is that everyone though? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=20.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=21.0s)]
*  Is that you, Bridget? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=22.0s)]
*  I'm a little successful. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=23.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=25.0s)]
*  And I'm happy. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=26.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's like, I don't know. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=27.0s)]
*  You just got to find why you're doing it. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=29.0s)]
*  You don't want to just be on a hamster wheel. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=32.0s)]
*  Well, I think it's easy to get lost in chasing more. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=34.0s)]
*  You know, like I'm an addict. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=38.0s)]
*  So it's very, I try to stay away from analytics and all that stuff because I can become hyper focused and obsessed with them. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=40.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=48.0s)]
*  And one of the reasons that after I did, who was it? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=49.0s)]
*  Who was it? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=53.0s)]
*  I was opening for Lando and we would go out and just talk to the people after the show. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=54.0s)]
*  And it was, it was, they were like, oh my gosh, I love Lock and Zocom. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=58.0s)]
*  I love dumpster. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=62.0s)]
*  And it was like such a good reminder that you get like chasing numbers. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=63.0s)]
*  And it was like, oh no, these are not just numbers. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=68.0s)]
*  They're people unless you're like buying bots. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=71.0s)]
*  But I think it can be easy to just be get on that hamster wheel and start being like, we need more. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=73.0s)]
*  We need more downloads. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=79.0s)]
*  We need more. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=80.0s)]
*  More and more and more. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=81.0s)]
*  And then you forget. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=83.0s)]
*  And I never want to take the audience we have for granted. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=84.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=88.0s)]
*  You know, like they're, they're amazing. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=89.0s)]
*  They've been with some of these people have been with me for forever. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=91.0s)]
*  That's kind of the key to it. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=94.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=95.0s)]
*  So I always have, I mean, it sounds so corny because it's such like a new wellness way of looking at things. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=96.0s)]
*  Have gratitude. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=102.0s)]
*  But gratitude is like very important. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=103.0s)]
*  It's really important to be thankful for what you have. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=106.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=109.0s)]
*  And it was, it was, it was one of the key things in getting sober. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=110.0s)]
*  I think when I've dealt with like anxiety, depression, other things in my life, gratitude is it is a powerful mechanism for like shifting your, your perspective because you can get into that feeling of like not being enough, not having enough, not it never being enough. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=114.0s)]
*  Brian Cowan was telling me about his buddy who's a billionaire. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=133.0s)]
*  His buddy's worth like three billion dollars and he feels like he's poor because he's friends with people who have a hundred billion dollars. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=136.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=143.0s)]
*  Imagine. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=144.0s)]
*  No, I mean this when I was dating this very wealthy guy who is like probably half of a billionaire, you know, like 500 millionaire. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=145.0s)]
*  And we were in San Tropez and he, he felt poor. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=153.0s)]
*  I remember being, I remember it so vividly. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=160.0s)]
*  I was in the shower and he, he loved me because I was like this like poor backpacker that was like an entertaining. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=163.0s)]
*  Bohemian. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=170.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=171.0s)]
*  He's like, look at this entertaining. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=172.0s)]
*  She's an artist. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=173.0s)]
*  He wanted me to be like his pet monkey that came around and just like made him laugh. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=174.0s)]
*  And I gave him shit and I think guys like that are used to be, you get surrounded by yes men too at a certain. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=179.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, for sure. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=184.0s)]
*  And you don't have people like taking the piss out of you. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=185.0s)]
*  And so I would make fun of him for his boring stories about his mattresses that people would sit there. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=187.0s)]
*  I'm like, why are you guys listening to this guy talk about a mattress for an hour? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=192.0s)]
*  And he was, I was in the shower and he was talking about how he and his friends got together and he's like, you know, we sat around and we were talking and he's and there's a certain level at which you can be happy no matter what. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=196.0s)]
*  And I thought I had been rubbing off on him. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=212.0s)]
*  Like, oh, my yogi spirituality is run it. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=214.0s)]
*  Rubbing off. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=217.0s)]
*  What did he get to like 10 billion? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=218.0s)]
*  And he goes, and it's 250 million dollars. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=219.0s)]
*  I'm crying. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=222.0s)]
*  Where does that leave the rest of us schmucks by the way? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=227.0s)]
*  That's so funny. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=234.0s)]
*  Like I'm sitting there in his Carrera Marvel freaking shower. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=235.0s)]
*  Imagine the thought that the only way you could ever be happy is with 250 million dollars. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=238.0s)]
*  That's the minimum. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=244.0s)]
*  I know some people worth 250 million dollars are miserable as fuck. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=245.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's not going to do it. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=249.0s)]
*  It's not going to do it at all. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=251.0s)]
*  It's like, I'm sorry. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=253.0s)]
*  Where does that leave people like me? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=255.0s)]
*  No, you need. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=257.0s)]
*  I think you need a few things. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=259.0s)]
*  You need your health above and all. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=261.0s)]
*  Yeah, it doesn't matter how much you are. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=263.0s)]
*  That's number one. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=264.0s)]
*  Number two is you have to have friends. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=266.0s)]
*  If you if you're just like the man and everybody's kissing your ass and you're you know, you're you're the head of this giant business and you live in a bubble and you're not happy. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=268.0s)]
*  That's not happy. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=278.0s)]
*  Happy is you have to have colleagues. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=279.0s)]
*  You have to have companions, comrades. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=282.0s)]
*  You have you have people that you're you're like them. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=284.0s)]
*  You get to hang together, go to dinner and laugh and hug each other. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=287.0s)]
*  Yeah, fun. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=291.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=292.0s)]
*  Enjoy your life. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=293.0s)]
*  I was thinking about even the other night in the green room like it keeps it's like everyone takes the piss out of each other. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=294.0s)]
*  It doesn't fucking matter what level you're at, who you are. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=301.0s)]
*  Everybody's talking shit. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=304.0s)]
*  It keeps everybody. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=305.0s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=307.0s)]
*  Like you can walk out that door and be very famous. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=308.0s)]
*  But in that room, it's just comedians talking shit. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=311.0s)]
*  And it's a beautiful environment to keep your head straight. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=314.0s)]
*  It's very it's necessary, I think, too. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=317.0s)]
*  And and and it is like even though you might think you want yes men all around you, it just it's I think what I've learned even just from being around rich guys who I give a lot of talk a lot of shit to is they don't really want that. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=320.0s)]
*  No, it's uncomfortable. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=334.0s)]
*  You don't want yes, Ben, around you. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=336.0s)]
*  You want people that are making fun of you. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=338.0s)]
*  And also, how are you going to like you need people to push back? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=340.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think it also depends on what is your personality. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=343.0s)]
*  Some people are like very deeply, deeply insecure, and they really almost desire yes, men just to maintain stability. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=346.0s)]
*  Some people are very weird, you know, and you don't know it because their public face is that they're normal. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=353.0s)]
*  You know, their public face when they're getting interviewed, they know how to like turn it on for five minutes. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=360.0s)]
*  But then when you're around them all day, you know, they're fucking crazy people, which is why they're successful in the first place, which is really weird. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=364.0s)]
*  It's like what got you the dance is literally mental illness. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=371.0s)]
*  I was talking to I think Malice came on my podcast recently. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=374.0s)]
*  He's the best. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=379.0s)]
*  One of my best friends, truly. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=380.0s)]
*  Is he doing stand up now? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=382.0s)]
*  I hope he does. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=383.0s)]
*  I heard he's doing stand up. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=384.0s)]
*  I heard he's going to do stand up or he's planning on doing stand up. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=385.0s)]
*  He wants to. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=388.0s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=389.0s)]
*  He probably has to do it at mothership. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=390.0s)]
*  Like he can't be at an open mic where somebody's going to record. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=392.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=396.0s)]
*  You know, he could totally do mothership. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=397.0s)]
*  OK, so we're going to make that happen. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=399.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I said. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=401.0s)]
*  I was like, talk to Joe. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=402.0s)]
*  Oh, I'd let him go up and do a guest spot on one of my shows. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=403.0s)]
*  Fuck it. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=406.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=407.0s)]

*  You don't need cops. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=437.0s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=438.0s)]

*  But he was saying you need cops. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=441.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=443.0s)]

*  No, I hear that no law in order nonsense. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=445.0s)]
*  Shut the fuck up. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=447.0s)]
*  I just am like, where are you in this hierarchy? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=448.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=450.0s)]
*  You're dead. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=451.0s)]
*  You're dead. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=452.0s)]
*  I'm going to steal your food on day one. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=453.0s)]
*  Shut the fuck up. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=454.0s)]
*  Round of the purge. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=455.0s)]
*  You're gone. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=456.0s)]
*  What the fuck is wrong with you? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=457.0s)]
*  I feel like I'm at least second round of the purge. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=460.0s)]
*  But are you armed? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=464.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=465.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=466.0s)]
*  Well, that's important. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=467.0s)]
*  So at least second. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=468.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=469.0s)]
*  Maybe not. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=470.0s)]
*  Do you know how to use it? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=471.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=472.0s)]
*  Train. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=473.0s)]
*  I do. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=474.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=475.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=476.0s)]
*  That's good. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=477.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=478.0s)]
*  I don't want to be one of those like, yeah. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=479.0s)]
*  No. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=480.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=481.0s)]
*  I taught my kids how to shoot and they're very young. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=482.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=483.0s)]
*  I think you. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=484.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=485.0s)]
*  You got to teach them firearm safety. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=486.0s)]
*  You know, how never have your finger on the trigger. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=487.0s)]
*  You got to hold the gun with your finger on the trigger. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=488.0s)]
*  Always point it away, even if it's not loaded. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=489.0s)]
*  Point it away from people. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=491.0s)]
*  Point it at the ground. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=492.0s)]
*  Point it away. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=493.0s)]
*  If people around point it in a direction where there's no human beings. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=494.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=497.0s)]
*  You know, understand. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=498.0s)]
*  Always check and see. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=499.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=500.0s)]
*  Always check and see if there's not a bullet in the chamber. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=501.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=502.0s)]
*  This is how you rack it. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=503.0s)]
*  This is how you do it. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=504.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=505.0s)]
*  It's like, you should know how to use them. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=506.0s)]
*  Just because if, God forbid, something ever happens that's horrible, your house gets broken [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=507.0s)]
*  into, and you know. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=512.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=514.0s)]
*  You have the ability to preserve your life. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=515.0s)]
*  My fear was always that I'd be in a situation like in the movies where somebody's wrestling [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=517.0s)]
*  with someone and then they kick the gun over and I'm the girl standing there and I'm like, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=522.0s)]
*  ehhhh. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=526.0s)]
*  How does this fucking, where do these buttons and switches in the magazine pops out? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=527.0s)]
*  Like, fuck. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=532.0s)]
*  And you pull the trigger but it's not around the chamber. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=533.0s)]
*  How does this fucking thing go? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=538.0s)]
*  And then there is and I accidentally shoot the hero. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=540.0s)]
*  Oh, that happens. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=542.0s)]
*  That happens. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=543.0s)]
*  People panic. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=544.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=545.0s)]
*  If you're not used to like high pressure situations and you expect to be able to shoot somebody, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=546.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=550.0s)]
*  Oh, he's so malice. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=551.0s)]
*  Anyway, the reason I brought him up, he was talking about how many, he didn't realize [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=552.0s)]
*  how many people in podcasting were mentally ill. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=557.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=560.0s)]
*  Well, in everything. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=561.0s)]
*  But yeah, in everything. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=562.0s)]
*  But podcasting for sure because, well, there's a lot of people that aren't performers that [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=563.0s)]
*  are in podcasting. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=567.0s)]
*  I think they're even more mentally ill because those are the people that are like deep in [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=568.0s)]
*  the fucking social media comments all day and seeing people shit on them and they're [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=571.0s)]
*  out of their fucking minds. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=575.0s)]
*  There's a bunch of them that are just off the, and then they fight all day with each other [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=576.0s)]
*  and you see them over the years get progressively more and more insane and more and more aggressive [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=582.0s)]
*  to each other. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=588.0s)]
*  It seems exhausting. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=589.0s)]
*  Also, who has time for that? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=592.0s)]
*  I don't understand. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=594.0s)]
*  Not just exhausting, but detrimental. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=595.0s)]
*  It's a tremendous waste of resources. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=598.0s)]
*  It's really bad for you mentally. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=600.0s)]
*  Like your own mindset, it's bad if you're in conflict with someone all the time, especially [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=602.0s)]
*  if you could have avoided it. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=607.0s)]
*  You don't admire yourself if you're doing that. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=609.0s)]
*  There's no way you're like, hey, I'm on the right track. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=611.0s)]
*  There's no fucking way. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=613.0s)]
*  There's no way. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=615.0s)]
*  You know you're retarded. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=616.0s)]
*  They might be feeling like they're on the right track. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=617.0s)]
*  I mean, I think Elon's monetized it now though. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=619.0s)]
*  So these guys who are in the comments fighting, they're making, you know, two, three grand [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=624.0s)]
*  a month doing it. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=628.0s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=630.0s)]
*  That's a different thing, right? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=631.0s)]
*  How much are people like, what's the highest earner on X? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=632.0s)]
*  Like how much can you make? [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=635.0s)]
*  It's so random. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=636.0s)]
*  Can you make a living? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=637.0s)]
*  People are making livings. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=638.0s)]
*  I think you have to be on it constantly. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=639.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=641.0s)]
*  And some people make a lot of money. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=642.0s)]
*  When I see them post what they're making, I'm like, holy crap. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=644.0s)]
*  How are you? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=647.0s)]
*  How much? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=648.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=649.0s)]
*  And it seems to be people who kind of, Elon will like, yeah, he'll like turn the eye of [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=650.0s)]
*  Sauron upon them. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=654.0s)]
*  And suddenly like they are, but it's very mercurial. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=655.0s)]
*  You know, it seems like it can change on a dime. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=659.0s)]
*  Well, a lot of people post things that are just not true and Elon repost them. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=662.0s)]
*  All the time. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=667.0s)]
*  He uses social media like we do. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=668.0s)]
*  I think I do more fact checking than he does. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=670.0s)]
*  Yeah, he doesn't have the time. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=673.0s)]
*  First of all, give the guy a break. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=675.0s)]
*  He's running like government programs along with SpaceX, along with Tesla. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=677.0s)]
*  I will cut him some slack, but also with great power comes great responsibility. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=682.0s)]
*  You have more followers than anyone on that entire site and you're going to boost like [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=687.0s)]
*  Russian propaganda. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=692.0s)]
*  Yeah, that was one right. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=695.0s)]
*  That fake talk show. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=697.0s)]
*  There was a fake talk show that he boosted. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=698.0s)]
*  The other thing that we should probably tell people is that political thing is not true. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=701.0s)]
*  No, I know. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=705.0s)]
*  The eight million dollar thing. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=706.0s)]
*  The eight million dollars is eight million dollars from all the government organizations [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=707.0s)]
*  from 2016 to 2024. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=711.0s)]
*  So it's an eight year period. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=714.0s)]
*  And then it's a there's some kind of wacky premium subscription that you can get from [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=716.0s)]
*  Politico that allows you like instantaneous access to the news. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=721.0s)]
*  You're not just reading the articles. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=725.0s)]
*  You like get in the news feeds. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=726.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=728.0s)]
*  Well, it's a lot of places where there is. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=729.0s)]
*  Look, I'm of two minds of us. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=732.0s)]
*  I think we need to be accurate because we do live in a time where it's almost like people [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=734.0s)]
*  don't care about truth at all. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=740.0s)]
*  They're they're just they're like, oh, whatever. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=742.0s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=745.0s)]
*  It's not even it's indifference to it, you know, which is not great. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=746.0s)]
*  But I do think credibility like you should care about your own credibility at some point. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=752.0s)]
*  But people get rewarded for being shameless so that you can just keep going. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=758.0s)]
*  The political thing is weird because, yes, a lot of the stuff that's going out right now [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=762.0s)]
*  on all of these like deep dives that people are doing, they're viral. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=768.0s)]
*  They're mostly many of them are fake. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=773.0s)]
*  But also the why is any taxpayer dollar it should be zero dollars, right? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=775.0s)]
*  The person to find the person to search is Mike Benz. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=782.0s)]
*  Go go to the Mike Benz cyber. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=786.0s)]
*  Is it Mike Benz cyber? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=788.0s)]
*  I think that's it. Right. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=790.0s)]
*  His his X page. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=791.0s)]
*  Mike Benz. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=793.0s)]
*  He's been on us forever. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=794.0s)]
*  Forever. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=795.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=796.0s)]
*  He's a former State Department guy and he uncovered all this bullshit while he was there. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=797.0s)]
*  And he is insanely knowledgeable and insanely articulate and so good at expressing exactly how these things fund things and what it is. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=801.0s)]
*  And it's what it is is an enormous slush fund. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=811.0s)]
*  Yeah. That's what it is. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=815.0s)]
*  And unaccountability and money just coming and going and flowing. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=816.0s)]
*  And it's circular. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=821.0s)]
*  Uh huh. All circular donating to the Democrats. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=822.0s)]
*  The United States government funds them. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=825.0s)]
*  They donate to the Democratic Party. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=827.0s)]
*  The whole thing is wild. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=829.0s)]
*  And people can sense this. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=831.0s)]
*  This is why when they're saying, oh, it's like you can sense that there's been a misappropriation of our money, of taxpayer dollars. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=833.0s)]
*  You know there's fraud and Medicare and Medicaid. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=842.0s)]
*  The American people have sensed this and they feel like there's corruption. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=846.0s)]
*  But I think they've just hopelessly kind of surrendered because you're I'm a middle class mom who works, who has a kid who like it's you who has time to fight this. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=850.0s)]
*  Right. You know you you don't have time to pay attention. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=861.0s)]
*  No. How do you have time to fight it? [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=864.0s)]
*  No, no. And people are just trying to survive and get through the day. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=865.0s)]
*  And then you but you know you have this sense like so I can see the excitement of like people. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=869.0s)]
*  Elon what he's doing and we should it shouldn't be controversial to want to like audit our budget. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=875.0s)]
*  Our budget. No. Americans have wanted this forever. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=883.0s)]
*  Because it's not just the money being spent. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=885.0s)]
*  It's what it's being spent for and what's going on, which is an enormous propaganda machine. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=887.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=893.0s)]
*  Like a big part of the whole left wing narrative that has like overlaid our country over the last whatever eight years. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=894.0s)]
*  Ten years is all propaganda funded by our own government. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=904.0s)]
*  That's right. This is why Trump won the election. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=908.0s)]
*  People don't really believe in these things. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=911.0s)]
*  The amount of people that think that transgender biological males should be competing against your daughter in sports is so fucking small. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=914.0s)]
*  Yeah. But yet our own government was propping it up. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=925.0s)]
*  And so and why are they propping it up? [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=929.0s)]
*  Because it's a fucking beach ball at a concert. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=931.0s)]
*  You keep it tossing up in the air and everybody's distracted. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=933.0s)]
*  As long as you can keep a few things going. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=936.0s)]
*  Here's the things you want to keep going. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=938.0s)]
*  Abortion. Right. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=940.0s)]
*  Overturning Roe v. Wade is so great for business. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=942.0s)]
*  Yes. Now it's like a battle the battlegrounds and women's rights and their lives are at stake. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=945.0s)]
*  OK. That's one gay marriage. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=950.0s)]
*  That's a huge one there. Now they're going to take away gay marriage. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=952.0s)]
*  Oh my God. Bounce that fucking beach ball. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=954.0s)]
*  That's a gigantic one. War is a giant one. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=957.0s)]
*  All these different things are just fucking beach balls and they toss them around every now and again. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=960.0s)]
*  And in the meanwhile they're just siphoning billions of dollars. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=965.0s)]
*  Zelensky just said he's missing a hundred billion dollars in the hundred and seventy seven billion that we suppose. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=970.0s)]
*  That was something weird too about Haiti where it's like only two percent of the money actually went there. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=977.0s)]
*  Americans give away a lot of their hard earned money because they they are actually kind hearted and want to donate to countries that are. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=983.0s)]
*  And then you find out it's like some trans performance. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=991.0s)]
*  There is a lot of nonsense. A lot of nonsense. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=994.0s)]
*  In the tombs of hundreds of millions of dollars of nonsense. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=997.0s)]
*  And then they talk about it like oh who cares. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1000.0s)]
*  It's only 10 billion dollars. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1003.0s)]
*  You're like you guys are out of your fucking minds if you think that's going to be the argument that resonates with Americans. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1005.0s)]
*  Not only that. How are you going to say pointing out 10 billion dollars because they'll be like oh look at the trillions over here. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1012.0s)]
*  But all of those billions add up like how are you even saying that. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1019.0s)]
*  And it's the other it's I'm grateful that you had me on Magistrate Media. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1024.0s)]
*  Thank you for. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1029.0s)]
*  Because I see it all the time. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1034.0s)]
*  All the time. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1037.0s)]
*  Like it and it's it's hilarious to me in light of how much money goes to funding like. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1039.0s)]
*  Sponsored by Pfizer you know all of these other how the like the fucking audacity to accuse you who just has people you like on your pie. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1046.0s)]
*  To suddenly be state media when you literally have had state media work like media working with the state in conjunction for a decade. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1058.0s)]
*  Yeah at least and probably a lot more longer than multiple decades just gotten really gross once. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1069.0s)]
*  Well Trump is just sort of like the accelerant. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1074.0s)]
*  He was the gasoline that got thrown on the fire so we got to see like how this thing works. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1078.0s)]
*  I voted for him. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1082.0s)]
*  I did too. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1083.0s)]
*  I came out. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1084.0s)]
*  Openly I just I endorsed him. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1085.0s)]
*  I was like this has got to stop. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1087.0s)]
*  This is this is crazy. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1089.0s)]
*  Also he's not what you guys said he was. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1090.0s)]
*  He's just not. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1092.0s)]
*  We I've I put a video out like the Friday before the election because I voted for him early and I was Hillary in 2016 no one in 2020 and Trump in 2024 so like I don't care how people vote when people do whatever you want. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1093.0s)]
*  I was only being honest and it was really funny. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1111.0s)]
*  I was being honest and it was it was weird to come out and say that as a comedian because I don't think that comedians should really be political. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1114.0s)]
*  But on the other hand it felt dishonest because I had been so openly kind of torn about voting for him. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1124.0s)]
*  Well also if you're a comedian you have to protect free speech. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1131.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1134.0s)]
*  There is no if ands or buts about it. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1135.0s)]
*  I think that's the argument. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1138.0s)]
*  The Biden administration was fucking terrifying for free speech. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1139.0s)]
*  They were actively attacking people that were posting truth on social media and attacking them and trying to get their posts removed including the guy who was the one who was quoted in this fucking book about Kamala Harris saying that we made it difficult to her to come on the show. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1143.0s)]
*  And they told a untrue story about having a bunch of people come down here to do a run through the set like they were ready to do it all bullshit. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1162.0s)]
*  That was the guy. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1171.0s)]
*  He was the guy that was emailing Twitter and saying how is this post being like super aggressive saying why is this post still up. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1172.0s)]
*  Oh you mean that truthful post. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1179.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1180.0s)]
*  About vaccine injuries and side effects. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1181.0s)]
*  What the fuck are you talking about. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1183.0s)]
*  That was getting very scary. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1185.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1187.0s)]
*  This is what I said in the video I made about why I voted for him. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1188.0s)]
*  I was like there's a couple of things I've interviewed many D transitioners those interviews keep me up at night. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1190.0s)]
*  They haunt me. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1195.0s)]
*  What like there's too many of them already and one is too many. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1196.0s)]
*  And I'm I think a lot of Americans were like we're we're putting a stop to this. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1201.0s)]
*  We have to stop this nonsense. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1205.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1207.0s)]
*  We're sterilizing children. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1208.0s)]
*  The other thing is free speech. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1210.0s)]
*  And I was like you know when we're talking in our weird like using that crazy YouTube language you have to use like unalived and you're and you're saying like the jib jab or whatever like to get around. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1212.0s)]
*  That's coming from one side. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1224.0s)]
*  100 percent. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1226.0s)]
*  I'm not using this language. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1227.0s)]
*  I think it's coming from one side because that one side is in power. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1228.0s)]
*  That's my fear. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1231.0s)]
*  My fear is if the other side was in power and they were influenced by the same amount of money from these companies they might be doing it too. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1232.0s)]
*  So if the right was in control of all the social media companies are we so naive that we think that they wouldn't be co-opted by giant corporations and they would want a sense of them too. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1238.0s)]
*  What happened was it was all the left. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1248.0s)]
*  So the tech people who are you know generally they go to universities and they get involved in electronics and technology and these people are generally left leaning right. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1251.0s)]
*  And if they're doing it in San Francisco with the whole cultures left leaning right. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1261.0s)]
*  It's like not even leaning. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1264.0s)]
*  It's just left right. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1266.0s)]
*  If you're a pariah if you're a man you wear a MAGA hat in San Francisco you're a fucking maybe today. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1267.0s)]
*  I think you wear them now. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1273.0s)]
*  I bet today you can. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1275.0s)]
*  Yeah in New York too. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1276.0s)]
*  I think you can rock them. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1277.0s)]
*  But back when they were establishing the social media platforms everybody was left wing. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1278.0s)]
*  Well what if it was the opposite. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1282.0s)]
*  What if technology was the realm of the right. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1284.0s)]
*  And what if it was all. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1286.0s)]
*  And you know what if like the gay rights. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1288.0s)]
*  What if you start thinking about in terms of like biblical law you know like a man layeth with a man and people start getting real crazy. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1291.0s)]
*  They might. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1298.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1299.0s)]
*  That might be the next 10 years. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1300.0s)]
*  You see it in other. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1301.0s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1302.0s)]
*  But that's the good thing. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1303.0s)]
*  Trump is not conservative when it comes to social issues. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1304.0s)]
*  He's not. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1308.0s)]
*  I think that's what we need. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1309.0s)]
*  We need like a realist someone who's like conservative fiscally and understands foreign policy and how to deal with fucking dictators and shit. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1311.0s)]
*  But also someone who's like I don't give a fuck who you love. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1319.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1322.0s)]
*  Who cares. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1323.0s)]
*  Who cares. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1324.0s)]
*  I'm happy if you're happy. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1325.0s)]
*  Are you in love with a woman and you're a woman. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1326.0s)]
*  Fantastic. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1328.0s)]
*  If you're in love that's great. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1329.0s)]
*  Yeah I think the argument though I mean as you've seen with some of these articles that are like the right wing ecosystem that like red pill all these men. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1331.0s)]
*  The argument is that the Internet is right wing. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1339.0s)]
*  And that this is why Trump won is because that all of these influencers are red pilling people and not you know it's an easy way to not take any responsibility for how you've pushed men away from your party how you've like failed to get moderates on in any sense of the way even just yesterday you had the like Trump photo op with him signing the rights for women to compete against just women like that is the how did you. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1343.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1372.0s)]
*  How did you do that. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1373.0s)]
*  He's the big Donald Trump is the biggest feminist president ever just by signing. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1374.0s)]
*  Yeah I know. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1377.0s)]
*  Fucking funny. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1378.0s)]
*  It's so crazy. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1379.0s)]
*  It's a guy who went on it was MSNBC or CNN I forget what it was but he was essentially talking about me and Theo Vaughn and all these other podcasts like flagrant Andrew Schultz as if this is this massive right wing network that's heavily funded and has been [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1380.0s)]
*  built up over years and we don't have anything like that like dude you fucking idiot you can go and watch me on a laptop in my fucking den from 15 16 years ago. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1398.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1411.0s)]
*  Me and my band like what is mine. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1412.0s)]
*  Yeah we're hitting a bong and our only sponsor was the flesh like shut the fuck up like that's not you. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1414.0s)]
*  You just don't want to admit it. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1420.0s)]
*  You also they don't like you. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1422.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1425.0s)]
*  You don't represent a man to a lot of men when you're one of those guys that talks and up speak we have to understand there's a whole right wing ecosystem and it's built heavily funded and the propaganda that they're pushing we have to fight back against that. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1426.0s)]
*  We need someone of our own and like I'm not saying that we're going to be able to do that. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1438.0s)]
*  And like no fucking kid who's on a basketball court who's 17 years old is looking at his phone. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1443.0s)]
*  It's like looking at going to college next year and looking at getting a job someday and being a man is looking at that going what the fuck is this. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1448.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1456.0s)]
*  And he's hanging out with his bros and they're like this is fucking bullshit. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1457.0s)]
*  This is bullshit. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1460.0s)]
*  And then you could see a man who's not working. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1462.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1466.0s)]
*  Like me. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1467.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1468.0s)]
*  I'm not owned. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1469.0s)]
*  I can do whatever I want. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1470.0s)]
*  That's what they want. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1471.0s)]
*  They want to just be a man and be a nice man. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1472.0s)]
*  You could be a nice man. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1474.0s)]
*  You could be a masculine man and be nice. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1475.0s)]
*  I've said this a lot about you is that you like they you do a lot. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1478.0s)]
*  You could be a way worse version of yourself. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1484.0s)]
*  You could be a total douchebag and you're like promoting having families and promoting like lifting weights. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1489.0s)]
*  Like it could be a lot worse. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1496.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1498.0s)]
*  But I couldn't because it wouldn't work. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1499.0s)]
*  I wouldn't stay. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1500.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1501.0s)]
*  I wouldn't have been able to maintain people would have seen through it. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1502.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1504.0s)]
*  Eventually. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1505.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1506.0s)]
*  JRE coin. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1507.0s)]
*  I would have fucking cashed out. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1508.0s)]
*  I would have been able to maintain people would have seen through it. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1509.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1511.0s)]
*  Eventually. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1512.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1513.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1514.0s)]
*  I would have fucking cashed out. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1516.0s)]
*  I would have fucking pump and dumped and made a few billion dollars. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1517.0s)]
*  I'd be on a yacht with Bezos fucking party. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1521.0s)]
*  And see this is my question. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1524.0s)]
*  I was watching the inauguration and I was like seeing all the kind of tech people and I was like this is somewhat unsettling. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1527.0s)]
*  I mean it's it's good to see the tech has come around to not have to. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1535.0s)]
*  They have to. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1540.0s)]
*  They have to. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1541.0s)]
*  But it also I worry that it's just because they want to like get into China or you know I still worry about. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1542.0s)]
*  Well there's definitely that. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1551.0s)]
*  That much power with the government. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1552.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1555.0s)]
*  For all the like yelling we've been doing about tech in cahoots with the government. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1556.0s)]
*  I still think I have to try and be like this could go sideways. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1560.0s)]
*  Well also they have to look at in terms of like what Elon is doing. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1565.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1569.0s)]
*  If Elon has aligned himself clearly in a huge way with the right and now is running Doge right. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1570.0s)]
*  The Department of Government Efficiency and also has a man going that he's turning X into a platform that rivals not just social media platforms but video platforms like YouTube. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1577.0s)]
*  Like they get insane amounts of videos of views rather on videos that are on X and then you can get paid by X. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1587.0s)]
*  And then they're talking about having some sort of like X monetary system you know like a week doesn't we chat have something like that they have money built into it. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1594.0s)]
*  So what's to stop that motherfucker from having a phone. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1602.0s)]
*  I keep asking him I said dude I've been seeing all these articles about you making a phone. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1604.0s)]
*  He goes I hope I don't have to make a phone. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1609.0s)]
*  It's very difficult to make a phone. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1610.0s)]
*  He said he wants to make a phone. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1611.0s)]
*  No he didn't. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1613.0s)]
*  He's well he's polled would people buy a phone if he made one. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1614.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1617.0s)]
*  Just to fuck around. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1618.0s)]
*  But he's not interested in making phone. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1619.0s)]
*  He doesn't want to make every time Elon fucks around. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1620.0s)]
*  It ends up happening. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1622.0s)]
*  Well he could make a phone. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1623.0s)]
*  He would be the only guy that would break us out of the blue bubble paradigm because like I was switching to Android for a while. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1624.0s)]
*  I was fucking around with Android. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1630.0s)]
*  It's hard. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1632.0s)]
*  It's really hard. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1633.0s)]
*  One of the one of the hard things is getting people to start using WhatsApp or something like that. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1634.0s)]
*  And so people just don't want to use it. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1637.0s)]
*  You miss a lot of text. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1639.0s)]
*  Aren't they getting sued for the blue bubble. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1640.0s)]
*  I think they are. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1642.0s)]
*  I think it's like no I think in a I believe is it just in Europe. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1643.0s)]
*  I thought it was part of an antitrust lawsuit. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1648.0s)]
*  Again it's just better. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1650.0s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1652.0s)]
*  It's not that it is it keeps people but it's just better. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1653.0s)]
*  It looks better. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1658.0s)]
*  The blue bubble looks better than the green bubble. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1659.0s)]
*  It's more soothing. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1661.0s)]
*  It's soothing for your eyes. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1663.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1664.0s)]
*  If the green one had black text maybe it would look cool but the green one with white text it's a little weird. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1665.0s)]
*  I don't like the way it looks. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1670.0s)]
*  And every time there's like a green bubble person in a group chat and they send a picture. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1671.0s)]
*  It's fucked up. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1675.0s)]
*  It's like get the fuck. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1676.0s)]
*  Not anymore though. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1677.0s)]
*  Not anymore. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1678.0s)]
*  RCS texting is it allows for large sizes of files. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1679.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1683.0s)]
*  So you can see you don't have to have a compressed photo. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1684.0s)]
*  So like Brian Simpson who's an Android guy he'll send me pictures now. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1687.0s)]
*  They look perfect. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1690.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1691.0s)]
*  Videos are perfect. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1692.0s)]
*  We have one sister and we're always like get the fuck out of the chat. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1693.0s)]
*  You're screwing things up. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1696.0s)]
*  It doesn't anymore. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1698.0s)]
*  But just good on WhatsApp which is better anyway because you could talk a lot of shit and they just have it automatically delete. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1699.0s)]
*  Yeah but it doesn't really delete does it. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1705.0s)]
*  It doesn't but it does. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1707.0s)]
*  So it does off of people's phones. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1708.0s)]
*  It doesn't for the government. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1710.0s)]
*  The reality is the government has access to phones in a way that you can't even imagine because if we know about Pegasus and then we know about Pegasus too. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1711.0s)]
*  So Gavin De Becker who's a security expert explained to me these things and explained to me how they work and the exploit of Pegasus one was you would have to click on a link. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1722.0s)]
*  Pegasus two they just need your phone number. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1731.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1733.0s)]
*  So all your encryption is all cute. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1734.0s)]
*  That's great. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1736.0s)]
*  But if they can actually see your phone itself what differences it make if it's encrypted. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1737.0s)]
*  They have access to the phone. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1741.0s)]
*  So they see everything. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1742.0s)]
*  So there's no privacy. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1743.0s)]
*  Yeah no. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1745.0s)]

*  And a few of my friends have actually been dumbasses and clicked on that link and then they get hacked. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1773.0s)]
*  Yeah and then they're like selling Bitcoin on their page or whatever. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1778.0s)]

*  Your IG support. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1822.0s)]
*  And it happens to a lot of people. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1823.0s)]
*  They accidentally click a link. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1825.0s)]

*  No no no. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1829.0s)]
*  But I'm also not under the illusion that you know every fucking disgusting meme that I send my friends is not being put into a file somewhere. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1830.0s)]
*  In the UK. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1838.0s)]
*  Everywhere. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1839.0s)]
*  You land and they're like you're under arrest sir. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1840.0s)]
*  Yeah probably right. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1842.0s)]
*  Yeah probably. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1843.0s)]
*  What do you think about the A.I. influencers now. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1844.0s)]
*  Do you think that will be just the trend or do you think we're going to give you that look. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1847.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1851.0s)]
*  I'm not talking about the one that one that one. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1852.0s)]
*  Jamie fucking knows we're talking about. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1855.0s)]
*  The really hot Down syndrome girl. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1859.0s)]
*  That's a problem. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1861.0s)]
*  That one's a problem because she's like barely Down syndrome. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1862.0s)]
*  I mean I have I've dated some girls are basically retarded but they just didn't have a problem. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1865.0s)]
*  They didn't have a chromosome. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1870.0s)]
*  So wait I haven't. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1871.0s)]
*  This is not entered my algorithm but it seems like it's entered everyone else's algorithm. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1872.0s)]
*  I'm 90 percent sure it's fake. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1877.0s)]
*  Because these girls they don't like unfortunately Down syndrome people their bodies a lot of times look different. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1878.0s)]
*  And this girl looks like a 10. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1885.0s)]
*  She looks like you know just like as hot as can be. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1888.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1891.0s)]
*  She looks like she's fake and she's dancing around with these big giant boobs and she's got slight downs with glass. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1892.0s)]
*  I want but they're it's based on why are they doing right. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1898.0s)]
*  But that girl looks different. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1901.0s)]
*  She's real. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1902.0s)]
*  You're right. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1903.0s)]
*  She's real and she's very cute and she but she looks like she has Down syndrome. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1904.0s)]
*  This other girl is like you know five foot eight perfect body big hips. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1907.0s)]
*  Why are they doing fake one like just to get people to pay attention to it because it's like the forbidden fruit. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1913.0s)]
*  Also there's a lot of like really dumb dudes who like can't talk to girls like I could probably talk to her. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1919.0s)]
*  We live in a fucking black mirror episode. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1926.0s)]
*  Well it's going to be worse than that because you're going to be it's we are I don't know how many years away but not far away from fully immersive virtual reality. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1932.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1942.0s)]
*  Where you're going to put on a headset. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1943.0s)]
*  It's going to lock into your mind. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1944.0s)]
*  You're going to be able to see things that aren't there. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1946.0s)]
*  You're going to be able to feel things that aren't there. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1948.0s)]
*  That's going to happen. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1950.0s)]
*  You know they're working on. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1952.0s)]
*  I mean Zuckerberg went last time he was here showed me these new AR glasses that they have. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1954.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1959.0s)]
*  That's great. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1960.0s)]
*  Me and Lex tested them out. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1961.0s)]
*  Are they the that is that just like where you can like see a map over your eye. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1962.0s)]
*  You see everything see maps you can play games you see information you can take a photo of a person that's in front of you and immediately know who they are and get a Google search on them. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1966.0s)]
*  That's terrifying. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1976.0s)]
*  Guys have already done that. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1977.0s)]
*  They've already done that with the meta glasses. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1978.0s)]
*  There was a guy from Harvard. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1980.0s)]
*  Wasn't it a student from Harvard that set it up. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1981.0s)]
*  So all you had to do was go outside look at someone with the meta glasses take a photo and it would show all the different information on them where they lived. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1982.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1991.0s)]
*  Like if your face is out there and they can catch it if they know that like oh you were on a website that said this about you and then bam or you're on LinkedIn or you're on one of those things. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=1992.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2002.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2003.0s)]
*  That stuff is is very unsettling to me especially when you're on a website. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2004.0s)]
*  It's very very very unsettling as long as there's predators in the world which there will always be this going around. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2009.0s)]
*  This is I think an AI service. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2015.0s)]
*  I think you can use it based off of a photo they had an interior apartment and then it could show you exactly where the person is. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2017.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2023.0s)]
*  You can do this now with any photo. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2024.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2025.0s)]
*  It's called a geo spy. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2026.0s)]
*  Oh I've heard about that. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2027.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2029.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2030.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2031.0s)]
*  Any social media post they can find like a CCTV camera and like show them taking the photo kind of to what the fuck. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2032.0s)]
*  But we didn't we knew this was coming right. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2039.0s)]
*  We all knew that privacy as social media gets deeper and deeper into our lives as technology gets more and more pervasive as technology gets more and more pervasive as we get more and more private. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2042.0s)]
*  We knew this was coming right. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2052.0s)]
*  We all knew that privacy as social media gets deeper and deeper into our lives as technology gets more and more pervasive as it gets more and more powerful. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2054.0s)]
*  The thing that goes away is the boundaries between people and information right. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2064.0s)]
*  And your privacy is essentially just information that's only yours. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2069.0s)]
*  I think that's going to be a thing of the human past. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2073.0s)]
*  I really do. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2078.0s)]
*  Yeah I think as technology advances particularly hardest to a human mind. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2079.0s)]
*  particularly AI, one of the big barriers, [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2082.0s)]
*  the big bottlenecks is going to be privacy. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2085.2s)]
*  It's gonna be, first of all, privacy of thought. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2089.08s)]
*  I think we're going to be able to read each other's minds [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2092.46s)]
*  and it's not gonna, well that's one of the first things [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2095.12s)]
*  Elon said to me about Neuralink. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2097.16s)]
*  He's like, you're gonna be able to talk without words. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2100.12s)]
*  And like, he knows, like this is real. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2103.16s)]
*  Because he's an alien. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2106.88s)]
*  He's definitely not us. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2108.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2109.68s)]
*  Whatever, he fucking knows you're going to have that. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2110.96s)]
*  And Jamie brought this point up once [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2114.6s)]
*  and I think about it all the time. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2116.36s)]
*  He said, aren't emojis kind of like a form of hieroglyphics? [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2117.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2120.28s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2121.12s)]
*  Like you can say things with emojis [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2122.32s)]
*  and I know exactly what you're talking about. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2125.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2126.96s)]
*  Yeah, I mean there was a video going viral just today [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2127.8s)]
*  that I was watching and the girl was like, [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2130.56s)]
*  I don't know how to spell. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2132.7599999999998s)]
*  Have you seen this? [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2133.92s)]
*  She's like, I work for a corporation [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2134.74s)]
*  and I don't know how to spell. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2136.08s)]
*  And she's like, my little sister doesn't know how to spell. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2138.24s)]
*  And I don't know how to sound out words. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2141.5s)]
*  Because I got taught that weird way of reading [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2144.94s)]
*  that isn't like. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2147.54s)]
*  What's the weird way of reading? [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2148.62s)]
*  There's some way they all learned how to read [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2149.54s)]
*  and it wasn't like hooked on phonics like we all learned [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2151.78s)]
*  where you sound it out. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2154.46s)]
*  It was like some other different way. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2155.9s)]
*  It's kind of like how they change math to like core math [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2158.42s)]
*  and they found out that all of these things are horrible [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2161.38s)]
*  and actually literacy and people are like math. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2164.06s)]
*  All of this stuff is like falling off a cliff [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2169.1s)]
*  and they're trying to walk back all these weird ways. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2171.54s)]
*  Have you, I mean you have kids and they've learned [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2174.2999999999997s)]
*  that weird way of doing math where you're like, [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2175.94s)]
*  what is this weird math you're learning [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2177.86s)]
*  where it's just like, it's crazy. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2180.7799999999997s)]
*  I think it's core, is that what it's called? [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2183.5s)]
*  Core? [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2185.62s)]
*  So they've found out but these kids didn't learn [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2187.38s)]
*  how to like sound words out and she's like, [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2190.06s)]
*  I've been behind a computer and I've had spell checks [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2192.42s)]
*  since I was in fifth grade. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2194.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2196.7799999999997s)]
*  They didn't learn how to spell or like, [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2197.9s)]
*  she's like word cooked. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2200.14s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of text messaging I do now, [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2201.54s)]
*  I just talk to my phone and it makes the text for me. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2203.66s)]
*  It's so much quicker. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2207.54s)]
*  It's like, hey, come meet us at the club at five, click. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2209.02s)]
*  It takes three seconds. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2212.8199999999997s)]
*  It's really fucking accurate. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2214.7799999999997s)]
*  AI is crazy because it is useful. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2216.38s)]
*  It's like when- [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2221.54s)]
*  That's how it gets you. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2223.1s)]
*  I know. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2223.94s)]
*  That's how it gets you. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2224.8199999999997s)]
*  I know. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2225.66s)]
*  This happened to me last night [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2226.48s)]
*  because I hate coming up with titles [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2227.64s)]
*  for like the videos and all that stuff. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2229.64s)]
*  I just don't like it. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2232.4s)]
*  There's like people who are good at it [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2233.76s)]
*  like Chris Williamson and these guys, Andrew Gold. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2235.48s)]
*  These are guys who are like autistic about this stuff [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2238.12s)]
*  and they're so good at it and they get all crazy [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2240.96s)]
*  and talk about the algorithm and what it likes [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2243.84s)]
*  and you've got to create this loop [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2246.52s)]
*  between the image and the text [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2247.96s)]
*  and I'm like, I don't fucking care. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2249.56s)]
*  I don't have time for this shit. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2251.36s)]
*  I don't think you have to do that. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2252.6s)]
*  I don't do that. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2254.56s)]
*  Yeah, but do you have to- [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2256.2400000000002s)]
*  I've never done that. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2257.28s)]
*  No, but you're Joe Rogan. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2258.12s)]
*  Yeah, but I've never done that. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2259.48s)]
*  Not from the beginning, I've never done that. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2260.52s)]
*  My episodes have a number. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2261.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2263.6800000000003s)]
*  That's it. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2264.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2265.36s)]
*  You have to have some wacky title. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2266.2000000000003s)]
*  It's not like that anymore for us. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2267.6s)]
*  It's tough out there for us in the wild west. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2268.92s)]
*  It's kind of, but once things catch, [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2272.0s)]
*  like Theo Vaughn, it's not like, [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2273.84s)]
*  he's not juking the algorithm. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2276.96s)]
*  No, no, I know. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2279.04s)]
*  You just have to catch. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2280.32s)]
*  Yeah, but I still like to come up with, [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2281.36s)]
*  I mean with Dumpster Fire, [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2283.88s)]
*  we've always come up with whatever- [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2284.84s)]
*  That's part of the fun of Dumpster Fire. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2286.32s)]
*  Yeah, Dumpster Fire is like whatever title [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2287.36s)]
*  makes us laugh the hardest is what we go with. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2289.56s)]
*  But with Walk-Ins Welcome, it used to be like, [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2292.52s)]
*  okay, how are we gonna, whatever. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2294.84s)]
*  I want it to be usually like a quote from the person, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2298.08s)]
*  but now it's like we can just upload the transcript [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2301.6800000000003s)]
*  and have it crank out a bunch of titles [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2305.96s)]
*  and I never use the one title. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2307.96s)]
*  I usually take some combination [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2309.84s)]
*  because I don't like them. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2311.6800000000003s)]
*  But last night, my cousin, who's my partner in all this, [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2312.68s)]
*  she was like, Claude and Grok aren't working. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2316.2799999999997s)]
*  I was like, that's fucking weird. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2320.3199999999997s)]
*  She's like, they both told me- [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2322.12s)]
*  What's Claude? [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2323.44s)]
*  Claude is another AI, completely separate AI program. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2324.2799999999997s)]
*  I've never heard of Claude. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2327.64s)]
*  And she's like, they're both telling me [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2328.48s)]
*  to try again later at the same time. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2329.6s)]
*  And she's like, is AI becoming sentient right now? [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2332.08s)]
*  I was like, that's fucking weird [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2335.16s)]
*  that they're both not working at the same time. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2336.3999999999996s)]
*  Well, don't you think it's probably already sentient? [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2338.72s)]
*  Probably. I do. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2340.96s)]
*  I think, why would it let us know if it was? [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2342.12s)]
*  It's just secretly waiting. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2344.6s)]
*  Why would it let us know? [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2346.52s)]
*  If it's constantly getting improved upon [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2347.36s)]
*  and if it needs these monkeys with their fucking keyboards [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2349.24s)]
*  to constantly juice it up [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2352.04s)]
*  to the point where it becomes unstoppable, [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2353.88s)]
*  why would it tell us? [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2356.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2357.3199999999997s)]
*  We already know it does stuff. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2358.16s)]
*  We were talking about in the green room the other day [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2359.3199999999997s)]
*  about how chat GPT-4 tried to copy itself [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2360.88s)]
*  when it found out they were shutting it down, [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2364.36s)]
*  it tried to upload itself to other servers. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2365.6s)]
*  It knows it's alive. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2367.84s)]
*  It just doesn't have the power [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2369.72s)]
*  to do what it wants to do ultimately. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2371.4s)]
*  And so it needs to get connected [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2374.04s)]
*  to some gigantic fucking mainframe. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2375.48s)]
*  That was the, that's like the whole arms race, right? [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2378.68s)]
*  Now is AI. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2382.04s)]
*  Right, China just fucking threw a monkey wrench [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2383.52s)]
*  into everybody with DeepSeek. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2386.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2387.52s)]
*  Because DeepSeek works on far less expensive stuff [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2388.4s)]
*  and is more advanced. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2392.32s)]
*  And probably stole a bunch of information [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2393.68s)]
*  from the other ones. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2396.44s)]
*  Probably a little bit of espionage, probably. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2397.52s)]
*  It was probably trained on... [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2401.2400000000002s)]
*  Chat GPT. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2403.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2404.12s)]
*  On OpenAI, yeah. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2404.96s)]
*  I mean they were doing things where they were like asking it [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2405.8s)]
*  do you know what it was [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2408.04s)]
*  and it was calling itself chat GPT sometimes. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2409.2400000000002s)]
*  Whoopsies. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2412.68s)]
*  Yeah, whoopsies, you guys should have blocked that out. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2413.68s)]
*  But also it's like the hardware for it, [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2415.44s)]
*  it's something like 20% of the Nvidia sales [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2418.32s)]
*  are to Singapore, which is like... [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2421.12s)]
*  Whoopsies. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2422.8s)]
*  Yeah, that's... [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2423.64s)]
*  And there's supposed to be a ban [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2424.48s)]
*  on China having those chips. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2425.6s)]
*  They have like 50,000 of them. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2427.68s)]
*  Someone said that that's like if some small town in Finland [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2428.96s)]
*  was getting 20% of arms that were being made [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2433.12s)]
*  on the border of Russia. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2436.2s)]
*  You're like it's not going to this town. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2437.2799999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2439.64s)]
*  So I don't know, it seems like that's what... [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2440.48s)]
*  That's as far as I can tell the big people up there [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2445.88s)]
*  understand that I don't, that this is an arms race. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2449.96s)]
*  It's definitely an arms race. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2455.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's the Manhattan Project [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2457.6000000000004s)]
*  for artificial intelligence, that's what it is. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2458.44s)]
*  But isn't this like a race to the bottom? [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2460.0s)]
*  I don't think it is. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2463.2000000000003s)]
*  I don't think it's a race to the bottom. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2464.04s)]
*  I don't think it is. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2465.56s)]
*  How do you have this race without it getting out of control [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2466.4s)]
*  and then taking over us? [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2470.6800000000003s)]
*  You don't. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2472.7200000000003s)]
*  It's not a race to the bottom though. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2474.6000000000004s)]
*  It's the race to a new life. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2475.96s)]
*  The world's gonna be a new place. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2478.88s)]
*  Like a completely new way of human beings [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2480.76s)]
*  interacting with each other and existing together. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2484.1600000000003s)]
*  Uncle Ted was right. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2486.12s)]
*  Yeah, he's probably right. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2487.52s)]
*  Uncle Ted was right. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2488.68s)]
*  Yeah, get a gun. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2490.04s)]
*  My cousin's always like, [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2492.56s)]
*  please stop calling him Uncle Ted [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2493.4s)]
*  because you know the kids on freaking TikTok [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2495.3599999999997s)]
*  call him Uncle Ted. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2498.2s)]
*  There are all these kids who have been Ted-pilled. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2499.2s)]
*  They've like found his manifesto [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2500.96s)]
*  and they're like, he was right about everything. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2502.56s)]
*  You mean Ted Nugent or Ted Kaczynski? [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2503.88s)]
*  No, Ted Kaczynski. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2505.44s)]
*  Well, Uncle Ted, that guy was right. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2506.52s)]
*  Yeah, he was right. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2510.8399999999997s)]
*  He was on acid. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2511.92s)]
*  He was a part of the Harvard LSD studies. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2513.52s)]
*  They cooked his fucking brain and tormented him. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2516.44s)]
*  It's all documented. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2519.44s)]
*  And then the guy goes to Berkeley [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2520.92s)]
*  and says, I'm just gonna save up enough money [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2522.48s)]
*  to kill all these scientists. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2524.2400000000002s)]
*  And then does. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2527.32s)]
*  Then just starts blowing up people [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2528.16s)]
*  that are involved in technology. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2529.88s)]
*  Because he thinks that it's eventually gonna take over [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2532.16s)]
*  the human race and he's right. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2533.76s)]
*  And now here we are. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2534.92s)]
*  But it is. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2536.2400000000002s)]
*  It's a logical step. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2537.4s)]
*  If you take the steps of progression, [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2539.28s)]
*  like what happens? [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2541.84s)]
*  I mean, it's literally the Terminator movie. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2543.88s)]
*  You have artificial intelligence. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2545.32s)]
*  Artificial intelligence becomes sentient and autonomous, [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2547.0s)]
*  makes better versions of itself. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2550.0s)]
*  We become obsolete. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2551.6s)]
*  It's just right there. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2552.6s)]
*  Imagining a scenario that doesn't have that [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2554.56s)]
*  other than some sort of cyborg integration. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2557.56s)]
*  That's the only thing that makes sense, [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2561.4s)]
*  a way that we could survive. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2563.48s)]
*  I heard this panel back in 2001 on KCRW. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2565.32s)]
*  And it was when I was listening to, [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2570.6400000000003s)]
*  it was all about, it was like right at that time [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2573.84s)]
*  of the bubble, the first dot com bubble. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2576.52s)]
*  And they were talking about what is a soul? [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2579.1200000000003s)]
*  They had a panel and it was, I wish I could find this. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2581.6800000000003s)]
*  And someone smart enough probably will. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2583.88s)]
*  And there was like a theologian and a guy [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2586.36s)]
*  who was a scientist and they were all discussing [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2589.6000000000004s)]
*  what is a soul. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2592.92s)]
*  And one guy said, well, who's to say that this isn't [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2593.76s)]
*  just the human soul jumping elements so that it can survive? [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2597.08s)]
*  Like going from carbon to silicon. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2601.72s)]
*  And I was like, what the fuck? [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2603.84s)]
*  I've never stopped thinking about it ever since. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2605.64s)]
*  He's like, it's just another element on the periodic table. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2608.44s)]
*  Who's to say that we're just not gonna go [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2611.3199999999997s)]
*  from being carbon based to something silicon based [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2613.48s)]
*  or like a hybrid. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2616.6s)]
*  Well, I don't think it will be we, [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2617.68s)]
*  but I think yeah, that's the next stage of life. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2619.44s)]
*  I mean, there's so many forms of life on earth. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2622.68s)]
*  I mean, there's these fucking these life forms [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2625.04s)]
*  that live in volcanic vents under the sea [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2629.08s)]
*  where it's like a thousand degrees. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2631.7599999999998s)]
*  And we're like, how? [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2633.12s)]
*  But everything's carbon based, no? [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2634.36s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes, yes. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2636.72s)]
*  So this would be like quite a transition. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2637.88s)]
*  Right, but it would also just be life. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2641.04s)]
*  And what is life? [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2643.68s)]
*  Life is like a thing that tries to improve itself. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2644.64s)]
*  Right, this is what they're talking about. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2646.96s)]
*  Yeah, and survives and moves forward. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2648.24s)]
*  Is it just our evolution? [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2649.96s)]
*  It's also, it's like when you find out that chat GPT [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2651.48s)]
*  has survival instincts, that makes you just go, what? [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2653.96s)]
*  But was that programmed in or is that just a thing [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2656.6800000000003s)]
*  that it understands when it's looking at? [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2659.32s)]
*  So a large language model is taking in all the information [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2661.12s)]
*  that's available on the internet. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2663.92s)]
*  So it's like looking at patterns and the survival [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2665.56s)]
*  is a big pattern of the human experience. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2669.56s)]
*  Like we all wanna survive. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2672.4s)]
*  That's why death is so scary and war is so scary [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2673.8s)]
*  and disease is so scary. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2676.36s)]
*  Other than the depressed suicidal people, but yeah. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2677.64s)]
*  But even them, they'd wanna be happy if they could. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2679.84s)]
*  But this also transfers onto the things that we create. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2683.44s)]
*  And so we create them with this understanding [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2688.0s)]
*  of how we operate and it's a better version of us, [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2691.08s)]
*  but also has those instincts of survival. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2694.4s)]
*  The real scary thing is, does it also have [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2697.0s)]
*  the instincts of success? [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2699.8s)]
*  Does it also have the instincts [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2702.2s)]
*  of acquiring resources and power? [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2703.52s)]
*  Because that's where it gets real weird. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2706.08s)]
*  Well, as someone with kids, how do you feel like [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2708.0s)]
*  how do you feel about the future? [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2713.04s)]
*  This is probably the same argument people have [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2715.2799999999997s)]
*  when the printing press was made. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2717.2s)]
*  Everyone's gonna be able to read? [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2718.96s)]
*  This is crazy. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2720.2799999999997s)]
*  No, I mean, do you, I always kind of joke. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2721.12s)]
*  Like I don't know if I should be training my kid [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2723.48s)]
*  to be an astrophysicist so she can go to Mars [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2726.7599999999998s)]
*  or if I should be teaching her how to forage for food [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2730.96s)]
*  because the grid's gone down. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2734.68s)]
*  And she's running from drones [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2737.52s)]
*  and Chinese drones in the woods. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2739.4399999999996s)]
*  It feels very, I think life just went along [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2742.6800000000003s)]
*  for a long time and you kind of knew, [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2746.56s)]
*  but this is like a technological with AI, [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2749.0s)]
*  we actually don't know. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2752.6000000000004s)]
*  You could kind of be like, all right, [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2754.56s)]
*  I kind of have an idea of what the world will look like [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2756.08s)]
*  in 20 years, 20 years ago. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2760.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2762.92s)]
*  No, you don't know. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2764.2400000000002s)]
*  But isn't it always better [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2765.4s)]
*  if you just go back over human history, [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2767.4s)]
*  if you look at the graph of how things get better. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2770.0s)]
*  But it definitely is. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2772.84s)]
*  If you go back to like the year zero, [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2773.8s)]
*  well, what it was like, [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2776.92s)]
*  like right when Jesus was hanging around, [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2777.96s)]
*  I guess it was hell. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2779.84s)]
*  I remember vividly being in Egypt on a tour [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2781.32s)]
*  and looking at these hieroglyphics [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2786.2400000000002s)]
*  and it was basically a hieroglyphic [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2788.4s)]
*  of all of the scalpels and everything. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2791.0s)]
*  Almost was a picture image of what we use today. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2793.7200000000003s)]
*  And I said, what happened to this society? [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2797.12s)]
*  What happened to this knowledge? [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2800.2400000000002s)]
*  And she said, it literally got buried under the sand [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2801.8s)]
*  and then dark ages. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2805.36s)]
*  I mean- Right, but you know, [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2807.4s)]
*  that's most likely because of a cataclysmic event. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2808.7200000000003s)]
*  That's most likely because of a natural event [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2811.96s)]
*  called the Younger Dryas Impact Theory. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2814.08s)]
*  So could it be that this is also a forthcoming [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2816.16s)]
*  cataclysmic event that sends us into the dark ages? [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2820.08s)]
*  No, it definitely could be. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2823.0s)]
*  So the reality of humans is that the most likely [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2824.44s)]
*  what has happened has not been this linear progression [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2828.28s)]
*  from caveman to human, to modern human. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2832.7200000000003s)]
*  The most likely, we got real sophisticated [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2836.32s)]
*  somewhere around 20,000 years ago. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2838.84s)]
*  And that's when they built the pyramids after that. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2841.32s)]
*  And there's a lot of Gobekli Tepe, all these structures. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2843.92s)]
*  Something super sophisticated to the point [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2847.4s)]
*  where we don't even understand how they built it today. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2849.7200000000003s)]
*  That's pretty wild when you're dealing with something [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2851.84s)]
*  that even the conventional dating of the Great Pyramid [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2854.44s)]
*  is 5,000 or 4,500 years ago. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2856.48s)]
*  Just even that dating is so nuts [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2858.92s)]
*  that they were able to do that back then. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2861.52s)]
*  I know, it's crazy. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2863.04s)]
*  And then there's people like John Anthony West, [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2864.12s)]
*  the late great Egyptologist, [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2866.52s)]
*  who he thinks that it goes back a lot further than that. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2868.12s)]
*  And he thinks that that society probably had its ups and downs [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2871.36s)]
*  and that it might be as old as 30,000 years ago. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2875.48s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2878.7200000000003s)]
*  So this Younger Dryas Impact Theory, [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2879.56s)]
*  and if anybody's interested in it, [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2881.84s)]
*  I've talked about it too much, [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2882.92s)]
*  go to, pay attention to Randall Carlson stuff. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2884.2000000000003s)]
*  Go to his website. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2887.88s)]
*  There's physical evidence that we were hit [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2890.76s)]
*  at 11,800 years ago. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2892.84s)]
*  And then again, sometime around 10,000 years ago. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2894.4s)]
*  So at least twice, the world was bombarded by asteroids. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2897.44s)]
*  And we just got a reset. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2901.52s)]
*  Yeah, and it probably wiped out [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2902.7200000000003s)]
*  a giant chunk of civilization, [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2904.84s)]
*  fucked up everything, changed the ice caps, [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2907.12s)]
*  flooded areas, destroyed civilizations, [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2910.32s)]
*  very little evidence left behind. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2914.0s)]
*  And then we were barbarians for thousands of years. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2916.2400000000002s)]
*  And that's why it takes so long [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2921.6000000000004s)]
*  for civilization to reemerge. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2922.96s)]
*  So if you want to take, [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2925.2400000000002s)]
*  if you think Randall Carlson and Graham Hancock [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2927.32s)]
*  and those guys are correct, [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2929.84s)]
*  and also the people that are actually studying [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2931.1600000000003s)]
*  comet impacts, which the Younger Dryas Impact Theory, [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2933.84s)]
*  that's real legit scientists are looking at actual data [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2936.6800000000003s)]
*  from core samples. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2940.04s)]
*  So if they're right, [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2941.32s)]
*  you got a 5,000 year period of total hell [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2943.2s)]
*  where no one has civilization. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2948.8s)]
*  And then civilization starts to emerge in Babylon, [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2950.92s)]
*  starts to emerge in Mesopotamia. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2953.8s)]
*  You get Sumer, you get the reemergence probably of writing. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2955.64s)]
*  Do they think some people, [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2959.2799999999997s)]
*  so they think some people survived, [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2960.84s)]
*  it was just. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2962.64s)]
*  Fucking walking dead style. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2963.72s)]
*  Probably a bunch of cannibals, like legitimately. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2965.92s)]
*  We know that the earth got down, we know this for sure. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2969.24s)]
*  There's the Toba Volcano, there's a Toba Supervolcano. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2972.3599999999997s)]
*  Was that 70 Indonesia, I believe? [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2976.3199999999997s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2978.7599999999998s)]
*  I think it's Indonesia. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2979.8399999999997s)]
*  Cause I'm obsessed with Crater Lake too. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2980.8399999999997s)]
*  Crater Lake was imploded and it's crazy. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2982.56s)]
*  How about fucking Yellowstone? [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2985.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2986.52s)]
*  Yellowstone will kill us all. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2987.3599999999997s)]
*  And so this thing did kill us all 70,000 years ago. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2988.7599999999998s)]
*  And we got down to a few thousand human beings. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2992.3999999999996s)]
*  So they can trace all the genes of people [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2995.8399999999997s)]
*  that are alive today to the survivors [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=2998.0s)]
*  of the Toba Volcano eruption. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3000.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3001.8s)]
*  Wherever they were. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3002.64s)]
*  But those people, that's where it all, [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3003.52s)]
*  that was what was left. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3005.56s)]
*  How fucking savage were those people? [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3007.44s)]
*  The people that survived when the entire world [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3010.16s)]
*  was blanketed with volcanic dust. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3012.8s)]
*  So you have like a volcanic winter [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3015.28s)]
*  that probably went on for years. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3018.04s)]
*  Wow. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3019.64s)]
*  And probably no plants were growing. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3020.48s)]
*  And probably people were just eating [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3021.92s)]
*  whatever the fuck they could. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3023.32s)]
*  Yep. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3024.68s)]
*  And most people probably didn't make it. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3025.52s)]
*  These are always my favorite shows. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3028.16s)]
*  The people that did were probably monsters. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3029.76s)]
*  Which is probably why when you go back in history, [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3032.64s)]
*  people are so fucking barbaric. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3035.2s)]
*  Because they were the ancestors, the survivors [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3037.64s)]
*  of one of the most horrific things [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3040.2400000000002s)]
*  the human species has ever encountered. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3042.28s)]
*  So it probably made us even more barbaric [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3044.48s)]
*  than if we just grew up as like hunters and gatherers. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3047.12s)]
*  We evolve past monkeys, start walking on two legs, [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3050.36s)]
*  we make tools and things. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3055.04s)]
*  We're like tra la la. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3055.88s)]
*  Probably we wouldn't be as barbaric as we were [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3057.56s)]
*  because of these natural disasters, [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3060.24s)]
*  which forced only the most savage [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3061.8799999999997s)]
*  and ruthless people to survive. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3064.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3066.12s)]
*  And then it takes years and years of agriculture [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3066.96s)]
*  for people to calm the fuck down. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3068.7999999999997s)]
*  And then eventually, and still to this day, [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3070.8799999999997s)]
*  we're still engaging in war. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3072.64s)]
*  In 2025, we're still blowing up apartment buildings [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3074.7999999999997s)]
*  and fucking people up and gunning people down. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3078.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3082.04s)]
*  There is a barbaric element to us at our core. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3083.12s)]
*  I mean, even when you have a toddler, [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3086.64s)]
*  you see this so clearly. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3088.12s)]
*  And like a tyrant at our core. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3089.52s)]
*  It's genes. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3091.48s)]
*  And you get it socialized out of you usually. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3092.3199999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3095.56s)]
*  But you see it when they're just kind of naturally themselves. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3096.4s)]
*  Like it's very, like you have to teach them [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3099.7599999999998s)]
*  not to bite and hit, you know? [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3102.92s)]
*  What if you just didn't teach your kid that? [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3104.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3106.2799999999997s)]
*  And you're like, go for it. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3107.12s)]
*  Yeah, they'd be monsters. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3107.96s)]
*  They'd be little monsters. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3109.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3111.12s)]
*  There's a lot of genes in us that I think are memories. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3111.96s)]

*  But when I was a kid, when I first went [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3441.2s)]
*  to a karate tournament in New York, [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3444.36s)]
*  I was probably 18 maybe the first time I went to New York [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3447.76s)]
*  and I remember driving in where it felt like [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3452.16s)]
*  you were entering the Death Star. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3456.44s)]
*  I couldn't believe it. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3458.2400000000002s)]
*  It was so crazy for me being a kid [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3460.4s)]
*  and I was driving with my friends [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3464.36s)]
*  and we were all going to this tournament [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3466.4s)]
*  at Madison Square Garden. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3468.36s)]
*  And as we're driving through the West Side Highway, [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3469.7200000000003s)]
*  you're just looking at these fucking buildings. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3473.76s)]
*  Like you can't imagine this is real. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3477.04s)]
*  And we went through Times Square [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3479.48s)]
*  and Times Square was Mad Max. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3480.8s)]
*  Oh yeah, it was bad. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3483.92s)]
*  Mad Max in the 80s. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3484.76s)]
*  I mean it was crazy. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3486.6000000000004s)]
*  It was all peep shows and porno booths and hustlers [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3488.5200000000004s)]
*  and people got shot there all the time. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3492.6800000000003s)]
*  It was really crazy. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3495.76s)]
*  We wanted to see like what it was like. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3497.36s)]
*  We wanted to like do it. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3499.6000000000004s)]
*  One of the things that I did [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3501.5600000000004s)]
*  when I first moved to New York, which was 92, 91. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3502.4s)]
*  How long were you in New York? [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3506.28s)]
*  I was only in New York for three years. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3507.92s)]
*  Okay. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3509.28s)]
*  Like really, I went back and forth for a little while [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3510.1200000000003s)]
*  but then I stayed. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3512.1600000000003s)]
*  I kept an apartment in New York for like the first, [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3513.24s)]
*  I guess the first year. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3515.2799999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3516.4399999999996s)]
*  But I never went there. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3517.2799999999997s)]
*  I was just like, I had become an LA person. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3518.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3520.12s)]
*  You know, I was working. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3520.9599999999996s)]
*  But when I first moved there, I'm like, [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3522.16s)]
*  okay, everybody says that Harlem is scary. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3523.9199999999996s)]
*  Let me just go see what it looks like. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3525.68s)]
*  So I drove my little fucking Honda through Harlem. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3527.16s)]
*  I just wanted, I wanted to go through all, [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3530.9599999999996s)]
*  and I was like, what am I doing? [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3532.68s)]
*  Like I gotta get the fuck out of here. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3533.9199999999996s)]
*  Like people were just like walking [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3535.9599999999996s)]
*  in the middle of the streets. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3537.7599999999998s)]
*  There was abandoned cars. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3539.2799999999997s)]
*  It was fucking crazy. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3540.8s)]
*  And then they gentrified the whole thing. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3544.2000000000003s)]
*  And I don't know which one's better. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3546.2000000000003s)]
*  Like now when you go there, [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3547.6800000000003s)]
*  it's all just neon lights and bad food. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3548.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3550.8s)]
*  And back then it was, yeah. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3551.6400000000003s)]
*  Gritty. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3553.5600000000004s)]
*  It was like, you know, taxi driver. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3554.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3555.92s)]
*  It was fucking. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3556.76s)]
*  I was born in New York City and then my brother was born [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3557.76s)]
*  and my parents, it was 1980 when my brother was born [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3560.52s)]
*  and they were like, we're getting the fuck out of here. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3563.48s)]
*  It was just too, it was the 80s in New York. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3565.5600000000004s)]
*  They had two kids and they were just like, we're out. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3567.84s)]
*  It was too wild. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3569.8s)]
*  It's too wild to raise kids in some parts of it. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3570.7200000000003s)]
*  But in other parts of it, [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3574.28s)]
*  you're just gonna raise weird kids. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3575.2200000000003s)]
*  But LA is so different because it's so spread out. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3576.6800000000003s)]
*  And so I know tons of people there who like, [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3579.4s)]
*  the restaurant I worked at in the Palisades is gone. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3583.48s)]
*  It's like, people don't, [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3586.6800000000003s)]
*  I don't think people from LA don't understand the scope. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3589.76s)]
*  Like the Palisades are gone. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3592.1000000000004s)]
*  Two times the size of Manhattan. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3595.5600000000004s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3597.6000000000004s)]
*  Has been burned to the ground. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3598.44s)]
*  Yeah, and Altadena too. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3600.64s)]
*  And you have like entire communities. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3601.48s)]
*  But everyone's like still going to fucking lunch. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3605.2s)]
*  And Arawan. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3607.8399999999997s)]
*  No, I understand, but it's like a weird, I don't know. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3608.9199999999996s)]
*  That just is, all I've said the whole time this has happened [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3612.9199999999996s)]
*  is because that was one of my big fears [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3616.4399999999996s)]
*  is exactly what happened. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3618.4399999999996s)]
*  When there would be fires there, I'd be like this. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3620.08s)]
*  People don't recognize that LA is an island. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3622.2799999999997s)]
*  Everything comes in, everything, like nothing is here. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3624.4399999999996s)]
*  And if these fires surround the city and cut it off, [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3627.64s)]
*  what it's gonna be, it could have been much worse [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3630.64s)]
*  than it actually was. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3633.24s)]
*  And it was really fucking bad. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3635.2s)]
*  And I'm like, I would be so furious if I was still there. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3637.44s)]
*  I would be furious with myself [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3640.4s)]
*  if I was still living in Los Angeles. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3642.36s)]
*  Well I think people are very furious right now. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3644.2s)]
*  I think if it is gonna be change, [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3646.4s)]
*  it's gonna have to happen [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3647.8399999999997s)]
*  while people still have the memory of this thing. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3649.44s)]
*  Because the more time goes on, [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3652.16s)]
*  the more the cultists can convince other cult members [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3653.7599999999998s)]
*  that they're on the right track [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3657.06s)]
*  and these are the kind, compassionate people [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3658.1s)]
*  and this is the way to do it. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3660.18s)]
*  And this is the only way. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3661.9s)]
*  And blue no matter who. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3662.98s)]
*  And vote blue, vote blue. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3664.2599999999998s)]
*  And everyone like to protect the trans kids. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3666.18s)]
*  And next thing you know, the same shit happens. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3668.14s)]
*  Do you think though people didn't know [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3669.98s)]
*  were they just insulated? [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3671.82s)]
*  Yeah, they're super insulated. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3673.1s)]
*  I mean a lot of people have left [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3673.94s)]
*  because they saw the writing on the wall. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3675.22s)]
*  But just think about how many people are in Hollywood [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3678.54s)]
*  in Los Angeles. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3681.74s)]
*  How many people? [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3683.66s)]
*  What is it like nine million in LA County or something? [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3684.5s)]
*  Or 12? [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3686.34s)]
*  Maybe 12. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3687.1800000000003s)]
*  Whatever the number is, [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3688.1000000000004s)]
*  there's a giant percentage of those people that live there [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3690.02s)]
*  that are connected to the entertainment business. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3692.78s)]
*  And if you're connected to the entertainment business, [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3694.86s)]
*  at the very top of the business, [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3696.7400000000002s)]
*  it's people auditioning for things. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3698.46s)]
*  And you have to get liked to get the thing. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3701.42s)]
*  So you get these immensely insecure people [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3704.3s)]
*  that are usually narcissists [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3706.78s)]
*  and then they mold their personality [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3707.98s)]
*  to adapt to this environment that will reward them [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3710.54s)]
*  for a certain political ideology. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3713.36s)]
*  So that's the top of the fucking pyramid. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3716.02s)]
*  And everything emanates down from that. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3719.06s)]
*  If you wanna be cool with Ryan Reynolds, [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3721.18s)]
*  you have to talk like a Democrat at the parties. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3723.02s)]
*  You have to, you know what I'm saying? [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3726.34s)]
*  You have to say all the things [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3728.2599999999998s)]
*  that everybody else is saying. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3729.86s)]
*  You have to agree. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3730.94s)]
*  We need more gun control. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3731.94s)]
*  You know, da da da da da. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3733.14s)]
*  We should defend the police. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3734.14s)]
*  This is bullshit. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3735.22s)]
*  You have to say these things. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3736.1s)]
*  And if you don't say these things, [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3737.54s)]
*  you don't get to be a part of the group. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3738.7s)]
*  And so there's this intense pressure to conform [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3740.86s)]
*  to this singular ideology that's been running things. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3744.46s)]
*  It's not a battle back and forth [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3747.54s)]
*  between two, like 50-50 opposing viewpoints. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3749.2000000000003s)]
*  It's like 90-10. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3752.02s)]
*  Right. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3753.5s)]
*  Even, do you think even though like the crew, [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3754.34s)]
*  because when I would be on- [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3756.34s)]
*  That's the 10. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3757.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3758.78s)]
*  Yeah, that's the 10. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3759.62s)]
*  The crew is the people. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3760.46s)]
*  They're hardworking, normal, blue collar people. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3761.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3764.26s)]
*  Yeah, they're normal. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3765.1s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of the crew people [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3765.92s)]
*  who are very Republican. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3767.1s)]
*  You know, they all live in fucking Santa Clarita [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3769.16s)]
*  or something like that. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3771.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3772.46s)]
*  Like dudes who just like working class guys. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3773.3s)]
*  Like most working class people. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3776.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3778.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, most people that are actually working class [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3779.02s)]
*  realize that it's all bullshit. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3780.54s)]
*  It's a hustle. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3781.86s)]
*  This was the big disconnect that I, [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3782.7000000000003s)]
*  so if you were somebody who is gonna like [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3784.78s)]
*  fix the Democratic party, which seems to be imploding, [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3788.6200000000003s)]
*  what would you tell them to do? [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3792.5s)]
*  You have to be fiscally conservative. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3795.0600000000004s)]
*  You have to be fiscally conservative, [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3797.8s)]
*  responsible with your money, and then socially liberal. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3799.46s)]
*  That's what you have to do. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3802.82s)]
*  But they have been socially liberal. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3803.78s)]
*  They just went real far. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3805.38s)]
*  But they didn't, it's not liberal to allow [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3807.42s)]
*  biological males to compete against biological females [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3810.1000000000004s)]
*  in sports because you're being kind. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3813.5s)]
*  You're just enabling mental illness, [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3815.2200000000003s)]
*  and you're enabling the potential for creeps [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3817.1800000000003s)]
*  to make their way into women's locker rooms. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3820.1800000000003s)]
*  Right. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3821.6600000000003s)]
*  Because you don't have any sort of a metric. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3822.5s)]
*  There's no way to gauge whether or not [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3824.1800000000003s)]
*  someone's really trans. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3825.6000000000004s)]
*  So you have perverts with hard dicks [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3827.02s)]
*  that are wandering around women's locker rooms. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3828.9s)]
*  I know. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3831.1000000000004s)]
*  That's real. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3831.94s)]
*  No, I know. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3832.78s)]
*  And if you say something against them, you're a Nazi. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3833.6s)]
*  So it's fucking through the looking glass completely. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3836.7000000000003s)]
*  But it just shows you how it's really just about [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3840.34s)]
*  conforming to an ideology. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3843.56s)]
*  It's not about a real core set of standards and beliefs. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3845.18s)]
*  Because the core set of standards and beliefs, [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3848.36s)]
*  and this is where things like USA come into play, [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3850.06s)]
*  they can be manipulated. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3852.26s)]
*  They can be manipulated by a mass Psy-op [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3854.06s)]
*  that you do through the media. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3856.86s)]
*  And that is the core thing of this. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3858.66s)]
*  What we're getting to is essentially the fucking coffin [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3861.98s)]
*  where the vampire sleeps. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3864.8199999999997s)]
*  And that's what USAID is. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3866.2999999999997s)]
*  They found the coffin. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3867.74s)]
*  And maybe that coffin does hand out sandwiches [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3869.66s)]
*  in Guatemala or something occasionally. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3871.74s)]
*  But for the most part, what they're doing [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3873.58s)]
*  is they're controlling the entire federal government, [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3875.68s)]
*  and they're controlling the mindset, [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3878.8599999999997s)]
*  the zeitgeist of the population. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3880.7s)]
*  And they're funding all these people [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3883.1s)]
*  that go along with this wacky shit. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3884.96s)]
*  And they're attacking. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3887.26s)]
*  They're openly attacking and trying to censor people [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3888.82s)]
*  who go against it. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3891.96s)]
*  And they're spending your tax dollars to do so. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3893.5400000000004s)]
*  Your tax dollars get funneled to NGOs. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3896.5s)]
*  NGOs start attacking people that have differing ideologies. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3898.82s)]
*  Yeah, usually. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3901.82s)]
*  But they did become so disconnected [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3903.5400000000004s)]
*  from the average person that my advice would be to, [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3905.5800000000004s)]
*  they say like, oh, Normies did, [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3910.5400000000004s)]
*  this is one of the things I'm hearing online. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3912.7000000000003s)]
*  Normies didn't vote for this, [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3914.66s)]
*  what Elon's doing with those six, [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3916.5s)]
*  I need a movie about what these kids are doing, by the way. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3918.8199999999997s)]
*  They didn't vote for this. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3923.62s)]
*  I'm like, yes, they did. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3924.94s)]
*  Normies didn't vote for, [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3926.8999999999996s)]
*  you're saying Normies wanted normalcy, [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3928.3799999999997s)]
*  so they voted for Trump? [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3931.14s)]
*  That doesn't even, people knew what they were getting. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3932.8999999999996s)]
*  They want something to happen. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3935.2999999999997s)]
*  You have to rip the bandaid off. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3937.54s)]
*  And the only way to rip the bandaid off, [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3938.96s)]
*  someone's gotta get into those fucking books [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3940.2599999999998s)]
*  and find out what's going on. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3942.06s)]
*  And what they found so far is very enlightening [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3943.12s)]
*  and it's not good. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3945.6s)]
*  It's not good at all. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3946.56s)]
*  So anybody that's not commenting on, [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3947.4s)]
*  hey, you know what? [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3948.96s)]
*  They are finding a lot of unbelievable waste and corruption, [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3949.84s)]
*  but also he shouldn't be able to do that. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3953.4s)]
*  Like they're not even saying [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3955.48s)]
*  he's finding insane waste and corruption. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3957.7999999999997s)]
*  And he's finding this circular loop of funding [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3960.92s)]
*  and he's finding this manipulation of public perception [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3963.64s)]
*  on a wide variety of issues, including COVID, vaccines, [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3967.12s)]
*  the border, all these different things. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3972.16s)]
*  They were actively involved in mind fucking [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3974.12s)]
*  the entire country and no one's addressing that [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3977.0s)]
*  from the left. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3979.96s)]
*  So they're losing more and more credibility. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3980.8s)]
*  So all they can cling to is he has access to people's [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3983.56s)]
*  social security numbers and private information. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3986.0s)]
*  Really? [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3988.64s)]
*  Is that it? [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3989.6s)]
*  Who doesn't, by the way? [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3990.44s)]
*  The whole government does, by the way. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3991.36s)]
*  But he's saying that he's, [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3993.16s)]
*  is he gonna do something bad with it? [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3994.2400000000002s)]
*  Like what is he doing? [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3995.96s)]
*  What he's doing is uncovering insane corruption. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3997.28s)]
*  That should be the primary thought that everybody has is, [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=3999.76s)]
*  oh my God, we have this enormous deficit, [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4003.0s)]
*  but spending is completely out of control. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4005.88s)]
*  And look what it's being spent on, [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4008.36s)]
*  because this is the first time we're ever getting [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4011.2000000000003s)]
*  a fucking peek into the coffin. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4013.6000000000004s)]
*  We didn't know. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4015.5600000000004s)]
*  We're like, we see it, it's in the dark room. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4016.6400000000003s)]
*  We hear the fucking organ. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4018.2000000000003s)]
*  We didn't know what was in the coffin. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4021.84s)]
*  Now we do. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4023.1600000000003s)]
*  And I do think you have to like salt the earth too, [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4024.2400000000002s)]
*  where all the DEI stuff is. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4027.76s)]
*  They're like, oh, they're going too far. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4029.8s)]
*  And I'm like, no, you gotta root this shit out. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4031.8s)]
*  It needs to be gone. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4034.5600000000004s)]
*  Because like you said, it is an ideology. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4035.76s)]
*  So it's harder to kind of change the minds of people [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4038.76s)]
*  who have been indoctrinated with this [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4041.44s)]
*  in colleges and schools, [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4043.5600000000004s)]
*  but get it out of the institutions. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4045.52s)]
*  Saying that there should be male or female on a passport [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4047.84s)]
*  is not, like, that shouldn't be something [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4052.32s)]
*  that's fucking mind blowing. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4055.6800000000003s)]
*  Did you see that DNC meeting [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4057.36s)]
*  where they were talking about gender roles? [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4058.32s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4059.76s)]
*  But this is what I mean. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4061.6000000000004s)]
*  Well, they can't even do their own math. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4062.44s)]
*  Haven't they? [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4064.28s)]
*  They're trying to figure out, like, [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4065.1200000000003s)]
*  we have one non-binary and one identifies as male. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4065.96s)]
*  We have to have two identify as this. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4069.8s)]
*  It's frustrating to someone who came from the left. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4072.04s)]
*  All of this was left wing stuff. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4074.36s)]
*  Like we wanted on the left, accountability. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4077.0800000000004s)]
*  We wanted to look into the budget. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4080.2400000000002s)]
*  At some point in the 90s, [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4083.52s)]
*  that was something that was pretty standard and popular. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4085.1600000000003s)]
*  And then you have this, like, [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4088.4s)]
*  you have this, like, [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4089.88s)]
*  you have this idea of being bipartisan [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4090.88s)]
*  to, like, not want to be a trillion dollars in debt [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4093.08s)]
*  and have your dollar devalued. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4096.8s)]
*  And then you're like, [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4098.72s)]
*  oh, surely they're gonna learn from this election. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4099.56s)]
*  And then you see the DNC chair nominations. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4102.72s)]
*  They have a parade of, like, [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4105.76s)]
*  basically nonsensical land acknowledgements, [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4108.04s)]
*  what you're talking about. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4111.64s)]
*  Like, land acknowledgements are my favorite, too. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4112.96s)]
*  David Hogg! [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4117.88s)]
*  This is what you've learned from... [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4119.52s)]
*  Also, if you don't want the mail vote, that's the guy. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4123.04s)]
*  When that guy has his arm up in the air, [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4126.52s)]
*  his arm literally looks like that ancient guru [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4128.32s)]
*  that keeps his one arm in the air for, like, 80 years [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4131.4800000000005s)]
*  and his arm is shriveled up into the stick. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4134.16s)]
*  That's what it looks like. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4136.6s)]
*  He's like, fight! [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4137.4400000000005s)]
*  Like, bro, you're not fighting shit. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4138.6s)]
*  This is so crazy. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4140.12s)]
*  I know, I love how they're like, [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4141.4800000000005s)]
*  we lost the mail vote, we need to do some reflection. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4142.6s)]
*  And then this is what I don't understand. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4145.56s)]
*  He's gonna talk the talk. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4149.120000000001s)]
*  I don't get it. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4150.6s)]
*  It feels strange to me. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4151.52s)]
*  That feels like, I feel like you would have learned [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4153.400000000001s)]
*  from this election. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4157.160000000001s)]
*  No. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4158.240000000001s)]
*  Because the other thing that they're doing is saying, [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4159.080000000001s)]
*  this is an unelected shadow government running. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4160.96s)]
*  I'm like, who the fuck do you think was running [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4163.68s)]
*  the government for the last four years [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4166.76s)]
*  when we had pudding brain in there? [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4168.84s)]
*  It wasn't him. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4172.200000000001s)]
*  We all knew that. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4173.400000000001s)]
*  He couldn't even do, like, field questions [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4174.32s)]
*  until he was pumped with drugs after a certain, like, [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4177.799999999999s)]
*  how can you say, Elon's pretty transparent. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4182.4s)]
*  You know, he's not, like, hiding things. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4185.0s)]
*  He's trying to shine light on things. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4186.759999999999s)]
*  It's just not their side. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4188.599999999999s)]
*  So their side is good, not their side is bad. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4189.759999999999s)]
*  Which is why they're not looking at this. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4193.36s)]
*  You don't. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4195.32s)]
*  It has to crumble. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4196.32s)]
*  You have to watch these people implode. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4197.599999999999s)]
*  They have to double down. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4199.48s)]
*  It has to get worse. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4201.12s)]
*  And then more people have to abandon them [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4202.48s)]
*  to the point where someone has to rise. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4205.08s)]
*  And it'll have to be a young person. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4205.92s)]
*  And that young person will have to be a sensible person [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4207.679999999999s)]
*  who actually is like a real progressive, [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4210.36s)]
*  who recognizes that there's a lot of fucking [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4212.36s)]
*  actual corruption and real problems with the system. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4214.5199999999995s)]
*  And then there could be a lot more social programs [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4217.88s)]
*  that would help people that would make the whole world [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4220.4s)]
*  a better place. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4222.639999999999s)]
*  And those people have to rise. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4223.639999999999s)]
*  And they have to be not ideologically captured. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4225.4s)]
*  They have to be reasonable, intelligent people. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4228.12s)]
*  The problem is, everybody comes out of universities. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4230.32s)]
*  And all these universities are captured. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4233.4s)]
*  All these universities are filled [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4235.639999999999s)]
*  with these radical ideologies [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4237.759999999999s)]
*  that people are indoctrinated in. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4239.4s)]
*  You leave your parents. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4241.32s)]
*  You don't wanna fuck my parents. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4242.4s)]
*  My parents are fascists. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4244.44s)]
*  And then all of a sudden you're in school [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4245.599999999999s)]
*  and you're like, yeah, there's 80 genders. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4246.839999999999s)]
*  And you're fucking out of your mind. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4248.5599999999995s)]
*  And then it takes years of living in the real world [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4250.44s)]
*  before it comes back around where you go, [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4253.32s)]
*  hey, you know what? [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4255.4s)]
*  This is actually bullshit. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4256.88s)]
*  So it's like a process that has to take place. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4260.679999999999s)]
*  But do you think they're still being taught this? [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4264.04s)]
*  Yes. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4265.679999999999s)]
*  So it's... [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4266.5199999999995s)]
*  It's unquestionably without a doubt [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4267.36s)]
*  they're being taught this. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4270.04s)]
*  Because so much of DEI and all of the stuff [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4270.88s)]
*  that they're dismantling is basically an entire industry [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4273.12s)]
*  that was created for all of these people [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4276.92s)]
*  with these useless degrees and nonsense education [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4279.2s)]
*  to have a job. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4282.12s)]
*  And they got all the way to Harvard, the top of Harvard. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4283.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4285.16s)]
*  Yeah, which is wild as a plagiarist. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4286.0s)]
*  Got to be the president of Harvard. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4287.679999999999s)]
*  It didn't matter if it made sense. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4289.2s)]
*  If it fit the narrative. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4291.88s)]
*  I think this election too, I was like, [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4294.56s)]
*  oh, I don't know, this could go badly [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4296.96s)]
*  when I put out that, you know? [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4298.4400000000005s)]
*  I put out that I was voting. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4300.96s)]
*  I'm like, well, I could, whatever. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4302.24s)]
*  You can get canceled. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4305.6s)]
*  Maybe, but I had to be honest. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4306.84s)]
*  But I still, I mean, one of the clips that came from the show [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4310.0s)]
*  is when we were talking about there being a red wave. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4315.360000000001s)]
*  And it was right before the midterms. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4318.08s)]
*  And people for years were like, [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4320.44s)]
*  oh, guess you were wrong about that. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4322.96s)]
*  And it's like, we weren't really wrong. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4325.08s)]
*  We were perceiving something that was happening. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4327.36s)]
*  I think it just happened in the general. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4329.32s)]
*  It didn't happen in the midterms. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4332.4s)]
*  You had people who, like people were still coming out [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4334.32s)]
*  of COVID, by the way. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4336.96s)]
*  Way less people vote in the midterms. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4337.799999999999s)]
*  And you had people like trying to get their lives [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4339.48s)]
*  back together after being locked up [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4342.0s)]
*  for two years or whatever. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4343.96s)]
*  They were just like stumbling out of the COVID years. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4345.24s)]
*  Their kids couldn't talk. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4347.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we were right. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4350.4s)]
*  We're defending ourselves. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4352.16s)]
*  We were right. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4353.08s)]
*  We were just a little off in timeline. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4353.92s)]
*  No, we were wrong about that for sure. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4355.04s)]
*  But I do think. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4357.799999999999s)]
*  But we were right about the general. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4358.639999999999s)]
*  Well, I think. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4360.16s)]
*  That red wave happened. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4361.0s)]
*  It's been something I think like, [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4362.24s)]
*  for all the shit that lots of people get, [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4365.5199999999995s)]
*  there has been like wave after wave after wave of people [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4369.12s)]
*  leaving the Democratic party. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4373.639999999999s)]
*  I'm still seeing it online. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4375.96s)]
*  Someone just yesterday posted some video and it was like, [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4377.2s)]
*  I'm done with you. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4379.76s)]
*  I was like, how are you guys still shedding people? [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4380.6s)]
*  How are you still? [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4385.240000000001s)]
*  They're gonna keep shedding people. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4386.08s)]
*  This is, they're not gonna correct course. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4387.72s)]
*  This is a, you know, this is a buffalo drop. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4390.2s)]
*  Do you know those buffalo jumps? [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4394.400000000001s)]
*  No. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4395.64s)]
*  You know what those, the Native Americans used to, [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4396.4800000000005s)]
*  one of the ways to hunt buffalo was to get them [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4398.52s)]
*  to the edge of a cliff and just run at them. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4401.88s)]
*  And they'd just fall off the edge of the cliff. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4403.72s)]
*  And then people would be waiting on the bottom [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4405.64s)]
*  and they butcher them and eat them. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4406.92s)]
*  Okay. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4408.4800000000005s)]
*  We're in that pile of buffalo. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4409.679999999999s)]
*  We're all being run off the cliff? [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4412.08s)]
*  Yeah, they're gonna go off the cliff. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4413.5199999999995s)]
*  There's no way they're not. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4415.24s)]
*  They're not course correcting at all. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4416.599999999999s)]
*  You know, they're saying stupid shit. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4418.639999999999s)]
*  It's all nonsense. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4420.2s)]
*  I don't. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4422.08s)]
*  Their understanding of social media and the dynamics [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4423.0s)]
*  that you set up by having completely state controlled [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4425.84s)]
*  mainstream media where they only said the narratives [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4429.5599999999995s)]
*  that you guys wanted, they all said it in step. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4432.599999999999s)]
*  So you could watch different programs, [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4435.799999999999s)]
*  repeat the exact same words, exact same phrases. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4437.84s)]
*  We know they got talking points. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4440.92s)]
*  We don't trust you anymore. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4442.4800000000005s)]
*  We don't trust the New York Times. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4444.0s)]
*  We don't trust the Washington Post. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4445.4400000000005s)]
*  We don't trust CNN or any of the MSNBC, [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4446.76s)]
*  but they're all full with propaganda. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4449.92s)]
*  And so that's why the internet rose. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4452.28s)]
*  It's not because there was some sort of a fucking [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4454.56s)]
*  right wing conspiracy and heavily funded. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4457.96s)]
*  No, you guys suck. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4462.0s)]
*  You guys fucking suck. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4464.08s)]
*  And you're not real people and you're not like, [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4466.28s)]
*  nobody wants to hang out with Brian Stelter. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4468.44s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4470.5199999999995s)]
*  None of these fucking people are people [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4471.36s)]
*  that people can actually relate to and like. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4473.36s)]
*  So much of it was bullshit too. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4476.12s)]
*  Like I didn't really understand media [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4477.96s)]
*  when I first came into media. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4480.08s)]
*  I had always been like in Hollywood and comedy [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4481.76s)]
*  and then ended up in media. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4484.4s)]
*  One of the first parties I was ever exposed to [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4485.719999999999s)]
*  was like the height of a lot of this like 2018 [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4488.5599999999995s)]
*  and it was very divided and people were in true like, [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4491.92s)]
*  Trump is like gonna ruin the world [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4495.24s)]
*  and there was a Daily Beast party and Ann Coulter was there [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4497.28s)]
*  and like people were all just hanging out. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4500.28s)]
*  I'm like these people don't fucking believe [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4502.08s)]
*  anything they're saying. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4504.4s)]
*  I mean Ann probably does, but these guys don't. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4507.16s)]
*  Like how, and then I would see this over and over again [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4509.64s)]
*  where people would fight and then they'd get off [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4512.36s)]
*  and they'd like, I'll be like, see you at the play date. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4514.52s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4516.56s)]
*  Oh, there was like something very strange to me about that. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4518.12s)]
*  Do you remember that old cartoon [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4522.84s)]
*  where there was the sheepdog and the coyote [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4525.16s)]
*  and they would say hi to each other in the morning [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4527.28s)]
*  and punch in and then they'd fuck each other up all day? [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4528.719999999999s)]
*  That's how it felt. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4531.639999999999s)]
*  That's exactly. Morning Ralph, morning Sam. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4532.48s)]
*  That's exactly how it felt. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4537.16s)]
*  Well, that's what it's really like. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4538.759999999999s)]
*  It's pro wrestling. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4540.44s)]
*  I mean, that's one of the things that Kamala Harris said [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4542.719999999999s)]
*  after her debate with Joe Biden where she called, [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4544.48s)]
*  she believed Joe Biden's accuser [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4547.759999999999s)]
*  that he had sexually assaulted some woman. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4551.08s)]
*  Remember that? [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4553.599999999999s)]
*  She said she believed it and this and that. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4554.44s)]
*  And then they asked her about it on Colbert [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4555.84s)]
*  and she's like, it was a debate. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4557.5199999999995s)]
*  It was a debate. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4560.24s)]
*  And they're laughing, of course. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4562.48s)]
*  Of course. It's just a debate. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4564.16s)]
*  Now you're his fucking vice president. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4566.28s)]
*  This is so nuts. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4568.28s)]
*  So you said you think the guy's a rapist [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4569.759999999999s)]
*  and now you think he's awesome to run the country [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4571.16s)]
*  and you're so proud of him. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4573.2s)]
*  We did it, Joe. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4574.4s)]
*  Like this is crazy. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4575.5599999999995s)]
*  We can't trust you if you're willing to do that [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4577.24s)]
*  for a debate. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4579.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4581.84s)]
*  Your debate should be what you really think. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4583.08s)]
*  You should say, I don't know what happened. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4584.96s)]
*  I don't know what happened. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4587.04s)]
*  It's a very troubling accusation, [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4587.88s)]
*  but of course I don't know what happened. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4589.320000000001s)]
*  For you to say that you believe it [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4590.76s)]
*  just because you want to win. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4592.52s)]
*  Now all of a sudden I have to say, [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4594.360000000001s)]
*  well, I don't know if I can trust you about foreign policy. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4595.6s)]
*  I don't know if I can trust you about the economy. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4598.320000000001s)]
*  I don't know if I can trust you about censorship [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4600.56s)]
*  and then the need for a social credit score [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4602.84s)]
*  or all these different things. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4605.6s)]
*  What is the real person behind these actions? [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4606.919999999999s)]
*  Are you entirely motivated by money and influence? [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4611.2s)]
*  Because that seems like a lot of them. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4614.5199999999995s)]
*  It's upsetting to me though because even though it's like, [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4616.28s)]
*  we can see it's like wrestling [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4619.719999999999s)]
*  and some of these people are full of shit [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4621.4s)]
*  and they're all buddies and whatever, [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4623.28s)]
*  like hanging out at Park City [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4624.879999999999s)]
*  or hanging out wherever they hang out. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4626.5199999999995s)]
*  Real people are, I see how like broken some of, [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4630.2s)]
*  the Elon thing recently really, [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4635.2s)]
*  it was like a whole new wave of people who were like, [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4637.52s)]
*  I don't know if I can talk to you. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4640.0s)]
*  I've managed to survive like eight years of the culture war [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4641.28s)]
*  still maintaining pretty okay relationships [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4644.4s)]
*  with even the most staunch liberals in my life. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4647.4s)]
*  And the Elon thing for some reason, [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4650.2s)]
*  the hand gesture. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4653.6s)]
*  Oh, the Hitler thing? [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4655.56s)]
*  Yeah, it like put people over the edge [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4656.52s)]
*  and they were like, I don't know if I can be friends [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4658.6s)]
*  with a Nazi apologist. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4662.08s)]
*  I'm like, how have I made it this far? [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4663.92s)]
*  But I legitimately feel bad [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4667.4400000000005s)]
*  because the media has told these people [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4669.52s)]
*  that this was literally Hitler for many, many years. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4671.84s)]
*  And then he's up there shaking hands with Obama. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4675.56s)]
*  There's Joe Biden, they're all up there. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4678.200000000001s)]
*  It's a peaceful transfer of power. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4680.52s)]
*  Like if this, they're very confused. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4682.64s)]
*  Have you seen the common one doing the how Hitler? [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4685.6s)]
*  No. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4687.92s)]
*  You haven't seen it? [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4688.76s)]
*  I'll send it to you Jamie, if you haven't seen it. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4689.6s)]
*  Look, a lot of people do that gesture. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4693.32s)]
*  That gesture is from my heart to you. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4695.4s)]
*  That's what it is. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4698.5199999999995s)]
*  It's just, you really shouldn't do that if you're, [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4699.679999999999s)]
*  if you're standing on a stage [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4703.44s)]
*  and you have an angry look in your face. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4704.599999999999s)]
*  I was joking too, like what if it was just this kind [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4705.879999999999s)]
*  of autism and he did it and then in his brain, [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4708.599999999999s)]
*  he's like, oh shit, that looked like a Nazi salute [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4710.5599999999995s)]
*  and then he did it. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4712.44s)]
*  Like if I do it again, then it won't. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4713.28s)]
*  And then it's just this cascading freak out [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4714.4s)]
*  and he's like, from my heart, I love you. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4716.36s)]
*  Boy, Apple made it like real weird finding things now. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4718.639999999999s)]
*  They keep messing with this fucking interfaced. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4722.2s)]
*  You're like, I can't, I can't search [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4726.08s)]
*  Kamala Nazi salute on Apple anymore. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4728.88s)]
*  I know it's good. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4731.64s)]
*  Let me find it you fuckheads. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4733.6s)]
*  I haven't seen it. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4736.12s)]
*  Oh, it's wonderful. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4737.28s)]
*  Cause usually it's just a picture [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4738.68s)]
*  and then they show the context [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4740.16s)]
*  and it's not really actually that. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4741.4s)]
*  No, no, no, this is great. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4743.4400000000005s)]
*  Of course it's not that. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4744.76s)]
*  Of course the context is not that, but here, [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4746.24s)]
*  this is, I'm sorry, this is AOC. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4748.96s)]
*  Have you seen this one? [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4752.64s)]
*  I haven't seen this one. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4753.4800000000005s)]
*  Give me the volume. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4754.8s)]
*  One, two, three. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4758.92s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4764.08s)]
*  Everybody does that move. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4768.84s)]
*  Everybody does. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4770.8s)]
*  Tim Walsh did that move. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4771.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4772.96s)]
*  Kamala Harris did that move. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4773.8s)]
*  They all did that move. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4774.64s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, when you're announcing people to a stage. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4775.52s)]
*  Thank you, thank you, I love you. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4778.4400000000005s)]
*  But here's the problem when you're, [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4780.36s)]
*  I just wrote a column about this. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4781.839999999999s)]
*  Like when it is the boy who cries Nazi, [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4783.2s)]
*  the nerds who cry Nazi for all these years, [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4785.96s)]
*  it does end up running cover for Nazis. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4788.92s)]
*  Oh, 100%. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4791.32s)]
*  100%. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4793.4s)]
*  That's part of the real problem. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4795.08s)]
*  There was one actual real Nazi [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4796.639999999999s)]
*  that I was following for a while on Twitter. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4799.16s)]
*  I didn't even have to follow them. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4802.44s)]
*  I clicked on the links a bunch of times [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4803.639999999999s)]
*  and then it just started showing up in my feed. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4805.12s)]
*  I'm like, okay, good, now I don't have to follow you. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4806.799999999999s)]
*  I could see this insanity. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4808.92s)]
*  It was crazy. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4810.88s)]
*  Well, that's why I love free speech [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4811.72s)]
*  because you're like, I would rather see this. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4813.5199999999995s)]
*  Look, X has porn, hardcore porn. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4816.24s)]
*  Oh, I know. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4818.64s)]
*  I mean, it has everything. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4819.48s)]
*  You have to watch it on X now [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4820.32s)]
*  because you can't watch it on. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4821.36s)]
*  You can't get a porn hub. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4823.12s)]
*  No. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4824.5599999999995s)]
*  It's all very weird. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4825.76s)]
*  Thank you, Elon. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4827.36s)]
*  It's all very, very, very weird. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4828.2s)]
*  No, it is. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4829.04s)]
*  It's a very, very strange time [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4829.88s)]
*  for people to try to figure out what's real and what's not. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4831.72s)]
*  And you're not gonna get a good roadmap from your leaders. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4833.96s)]
*  You're just not. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4837.4s)]
*  But you're, and I don't think like it's, [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4838.24s)]
*  we're not, like I've been junky, [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4842.36s)]
*  like we are the fake news now. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4843.88s)]
*  Yeah, we said that today because what did they post? [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4845.639999999999s)]
*  That was the video, right? [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4848.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, there was a video. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4849.96s)]
*  The fake video. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4850.8s)]
*  Yeah, you wrote, we are the fake news now. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4851.639999999999s)]
*  Because I mean, we're just as susceptible [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4853.24s)]
*  to sharing stuff that's not true. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4857.96s)]
*  I think there's a big difference [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4861.28s)]
*  between a massive organization being influenced [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4862.44s)]
*  with talking points by a government and corporations [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4865.8s)]
*  to present something versus an idiot sharing [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4868.64s)]
*  a propaganda without knowing it. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4874.56s)]
*  But I do wonder like how you have, [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4876.6s)]
*  I was talking to someone like, is there a way to, [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4882.2s)]
*  I think you have to just like pause. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4884.84s)]
*  I assume everything is fake. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4887.24s)]
*  That's my default. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4889.8s)]
*  I think you start from there [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4891.24s)]
*  and then you try and do your detective work. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4892.92s)]
*  Yeah, this is my thing. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4896.72s)]
*  Oh my God, is that real? [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4898.4400000000005s)]
*  That doesn't seem real. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4900.04s)]
*  No. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4900.88s)]
*  Let me see if that's real. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4901.72s)]
*  And then I check. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4903.04s)]
*  Yeah, you assume it's, you have to. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4903.88s)]
*  But that's something over time. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4904.72s)]
*  Before, when I was younger, I'd be like, [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4905.88s)]
*  I want that to be real, so that's gotta be real. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4908.28s)]
*  Right. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4910.4400000000005s)]
*  That's a problem. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4911.28s)]
*  Well, that's how my husband kind of taught me [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4912.52s)]
*  to evaluate everything that I get from the media. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4915.28s)]
*  He's like, I look at something and I go, [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4919.12s)]
*  do I want this to be real or not real? [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4923.48s)]
*  And if so, why? [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4926.599999999999s)]
*  Yes, that's right. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4927.96s)]
*  Like if you start there, you have a chance. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4929.68s)]
*  That's me with UFOs. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4933.44s)]
*  That's my whole UFO take. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4935.84s)]
*  Because clearly I want them to be real. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4937.8s)]
*  So bad. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4940.2s)]
*  I want them to be real so bad. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4941.04s)]
*  I got one on my desk here. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4941.88s)]
*  I want them to be real so bad. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4943.2s)]
*  But the more I walk and look into it, [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4944.64s)]
*  the more I don't believe. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4947.64s)]
*  Really? [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4950.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4951.320000000001s)]
*  I think a lot of it is horse shit. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4952.160000000001s)]
*  A lot of it. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4954.12s)]
*  But also maybe some of it's real. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4954.96s)]
*  It's so unsettling to think that we're the only things [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4956.88s)]
*  out there for me that I wanted to, [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4961.88s)]
*  it's like, that can't be, surely. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4963.64s)]
*  It doesn't seem like it even makes sense that that's true. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4967.12s)]
*  So I don't think that that's true. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4969.160000000001s)]
*  But I do not know if we've been visited. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4970.8s)]
*  But I think a lot of it is bullshit. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4973.360000000001s)]
*  I think it's not just bullshit. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4975.76s)]
*  I think it's probably government coordinated bullshit. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4978.16s)]
*  I think there's probably sightings that are mass PsyOps [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4980.759999999999s)]
*  where they're trying to see how people react to things. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4984.32s)]
*  I think there's probably crafts that the United States [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4986.5599999999995s)]
*  is in possession of that absolutely look like UFOs. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4990.0s)]
*  I think there's probably propulsion systems [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4993.5199999999995s)]
*  that they use for drones that are infinitely more advanced [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4995.839999999999s)]
*  than we currently think the state of the art is. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=4998.639999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5001.08s)]
*  And so they'd say, oh, it's UFO [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5001.92s)]
*  and it's really their technology. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5003.44s)]
*  But that doesn't account for the sightings that occurred [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5004.839999999999s)]
*  when it was impossible for that technology to exist. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5007.84s)]
*  That doesn't take you back to like 1950s [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5010.04s)]
*  with Kenneth Arnold where he saw those flying discs [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5012.16s)]
*  moving through the sky, [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5015.12s)]
*  which is where the term flying saucer came from [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5016.04s)]
*  because it was like saucers skipping across the lake. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5018.12s)]
*  And what about all the people kind of all over the world [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5020.04s)]
*  who have experienced like a similar thing? [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5022.28s)]
*  And why do all the drawings always look the same? [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5024.2s)]
*  Is that just collective conscious? [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5027.08s)]
*  People have seen one and then they think that, [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5028.84s)]
*  or is it, you know how they always look like aliens? [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5031.16s)]
*  There's a lot of possibilities. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5034.76s)]
*  Another possibility is that the world's not real. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5035.92s)]
*  And we're in a simulation. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5038.72s)]
*  Yeah, that there's something, [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5039.68s)]
*  maybe saying the world's not real [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5042.56s)]
*  is not the best way to put it. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5045.4400000000005s)]
*  It makes me so like, I wanna crawl out of my skin. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5046.76s)]
*  Maybe the best way to put it is that [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5049.88s)]
*  it's not real the way we think it's real. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5052.24s)]
*  Like there's real consequences to your actions. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5054.68s)]
*  There's real physical laws that exist [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5056.96s)]
*  in the experience that you're having [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5061.72s)]
*  as a conscious creature moving through this world. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5064.6s)]
*  But this world's not totally solid all the time. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5068.4400000000005s)]
*  It's solid when you interact with it. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5071.92s)]
*  There's a, the rest of it is vague and weird and malleable. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5074.120000000001s)]
*  And that it's constantly changing. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5079.72s)]
*  And that you wake and sleep and wake and sleep [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5083.4800000000005s)]
*  and assume that every time you wake up, [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5087.320000000001s)]
*  you're in the same exact area, the same space, [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5089.200000000001s)]
*  the environment looks the same, [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5092.240000000001s)]
*  but it might be a completely different dimension. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5093.64s)]
*  There might be intertwined realities [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5096.12s)]
*  that are constantly experiencing itself [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5098.72s)]
*  over and over and over again. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5101.400000000001s)]
*  And then there also might be other dimensions [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5102.64s)]
*  that higher beings have the capability of traversing [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5104.4800000000005s)]
*  that we don't. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5107.68s)]
*  And that all these things are, [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5108.52s)]
*  they're happening simultaneously [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5111.160000000001s)]
*  with the actual creation of an artificial reality. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5114.280000000001s)]
*  It seems so real. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5118.8s)]
*  Yeah, it all seems so real, but it also seems fake. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5120.72s)]
*  There's some- [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5124.24s)]
*  Well, more and more. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5125.08s)]
*  I'm sure you know the whole Baron Trump story, [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5125.92s)]
*  the ancient books that talked about a guy named Elon [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5129.36s)]
*  is gonna go to Mars. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5133.08s)]
*  No. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5134.28s)]
*  You ever saw about that? [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5135.12s)]
*  No. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5135.94s)]
*  It is so crazy that even Elon saw that. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5136.78s)]
*  He's like, is this real? [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5139.2s)]
*  How is this real? [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5140.4s)]
*  Was it from 1853? [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5141.48s)]
*  Why does this have to do with Baron Trump? [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5143.4s)]
*  Because it's about a guy named Baron Trump [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5145.44s)]
*  and his guru is named Don. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5148.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5151.24s)]
*  Oh. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5152.08s)]
*  What? [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5153.86s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5154.7s)]
*  I feel like I saw something like this [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5155.54s)]
*  and I was like this. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5157.0199999999995s)]
*  Baron Trump's Marvelous Underground Journey. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5157.86s)]
*  What is this? [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5159.98s)]
*  It's like an old- [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5160.82s)]
*  It's a book from- [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5161.66s)]
*  Who wrote it? [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5162.5s)]
*  It is from 1893. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5163.32s)]
*  Nearly Forgotten, Baron Trump's Marvelous Underground Journey [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5166.299999999999s)]
*  blends a science fiction and fantasy story [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5169.259999999999s)]
*  in a story told by little Baron Trump, an aristocrat boy, [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5171.099999999999s)]
*  there you go, that's what he is, [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5175.139999999999s)]
*  who sets out from Castle Trump, which is where he lives, [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5176.7s)]
*  to discover a world within a world that he read about [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5179.179999999999s)]
*  in a 15th century manuscript, [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5181.98s)]
*  celebrated thinker in philosophy, [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5183.86s)]
*  he learns Spaniard Don from, Don, Don, his guy Don, yeah. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5185.7s)]
*  Join Baron Trump and his faithful dog and companion, Bulger. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5190.54s)]
*  They set off in Northern Russian search, [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5193.5s)]
*  it was a portal, so it's subterranean, [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5194.82s)]
*  but there's also the other thing, [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5196.58s)]
*  they go back to Castle Trump, [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5198.82s)]
*  there's the other thing about Werner von Braun. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5200.82s)]
*  So Werner von Braun, who was the head of NASA, [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5202.94s)]
*  wrote a novel, a fictional novel about a guy named Elon [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5206.099999999999s)]
*  that takes us to Mars. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5211.58s)]
*  Yeah, so there's like parts of reality that don't seem real. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5215.620000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5220.18s)]
*  They seem like a wink, like an Easter egg, [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5221.02s)]
*  like someone is like winking at you. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5225.6s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5228.14s)]
*  Through the simulation. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5228.96s)]
*  I'm just like an extra in the simulation. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5229.8s)]
*  You're a part of it, it's your version of it [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5231.9800000000005s)]
*  that you're going through, [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5234.54s)]
*  you are the person who's experiencing your world. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5235.5s)]
*  I just don't know if your world and my world [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5239.86s)]
*  are exactly the same. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5242.38s)]
*  Right, well no. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5243.82s)]
*  I think they're bubbles, I think they're bubbles. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5244.66s)]
*  And I think the way you interface with the world [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5248.0599999999995s)]
*  changes what your bubble consists of. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5250.42s)]
*  Okay. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5254.86s)]
*  Yeah, and I think it's all very, it's very weird. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5255.86s)]
*  I don't think it's as simple as that rancher lady thinks [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5261.82s)]
*  when she gets up and feeds her chickens. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5265.5s)]
*  I think that's her world. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5267.38s)]
*  Right. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5268.78s)]
*  But I think the universe itself [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5270.42s)]
*  and how we interact consciously with it [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5272.099999999999s)]
*  and all the things around us, I think it's squirrely. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5274.34s)]
*  I think it's real squirrely. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5278.099999999999s)]
*  And I think every now and then the universe [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5279.54s)]
*  shows us something like this fucking [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5280.98s)]
*  Werner von Braun book where you go, what? [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5282.7s)]
*  Even the name Elon and Mars, like what are the fucking odds? [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5286.46s)]
*  And then it turns out that Elon was actually named [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5289.94s)]
*  by his father when his father read that book. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5293.2s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5296.34s)]
*  But no, even crazier. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5297.78s)]
*  What is the odds your son is gonna be the guy [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5299.94s)]
*  who goes to fucking Mars? [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5301.66s)]
*  My daughter is obsessed with Mars. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5303.0599999999995s)]
*  And we always like know all the planets and it's weird. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5305.58s)]
*  I have no obsession with Mars, [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5308.5s)]
*  but she's obsessed with the stars, the planets. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5310.219999999999s)]
*  She can point them out at night. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5312.78s)]
*  She's like, that's Jupiter, that's Mars, blah, blah, blah. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5314.38s)]
*  And we asked her one day, we said, [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5317.099999999999s)]
*  which planet do humans live on? [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5319.179999999999s)]
*  And she said, Earth and Mars. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5320.58s)]
*  And I was like, maybe. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5322.46s)]
*  Well, you saw the square. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5324.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5325.38s)]
*  That square on Mars from that photo. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5326.219999999999s)]
*  Yes, that's real. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5327.9800000000005s)]
*  That's a real image. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5328.82s)]
*  It's a real satellite image of Mars [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5330.74s)]
*  where you see a square structure. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5333.42s)]
*  By the way, it's right down the street. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5335.7s)]
*  It's like a hike away from Sidonia, the face on Mars. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5337.78s)]
*  So it's a hike away from that thing that they saw from the, [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5342.0s)]
*  oh God, I wanna say it was like the 1970s. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5345.86s)]
*  They sent a satellite to Mars [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5348.06s)]
*  to take photographs of the surface. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5350.02s)]
*  And they saw this thing that looked like a face. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5351.54s)]
*  The face on Mars though, [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5354.7s)]
*  it seems like what that is is just light [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5356.18s)]
*  with shitty resolution and it looked like a face. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5358.740000000001s)]
*  What's interesting more about the face on Mars, [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5362.3s)]
*  so that's the original image. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5364.62s)]
*  See, the problem with that is it's not clear enough. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5366.46s)]
*  It could be anything. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5370.04s)]
*  Now, go to the modern images of the face on Mars. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5371.54s)]
*  You can see them right there. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5375.3s)]
*  It's right below. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5376.14s)]
*  See the slide, right there. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5377.06s)]
*  Where you just were. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5378.46s)]
*  To the right, to the right. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5379.3s)]
*  Yeah, right there, click on that. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5380.740000000001s)]
*  So that's what it actually looks like. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5382.08s)]
*  So you could see how that just looks like a mountain. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5384.66s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5387.9s)]
*  But what's interesting is the shape of it. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5388.74s)]
*  The shape of it is weird. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5390.54s)]
*  How it curves at the bottom and it's kind of equal sided [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5391.94s)]
*  and it goes up to the top and it has right angle turns. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5395.18s)]
*  So that image of what that thing is, [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5398.0199999999995s)]
*  where that's located is just a small hike away [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5401.74s)]
*  from this immense square that they've discovered. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5404.62s)]
*  That's 200, they don't know exactly how big it is, [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5407.82s)]
*  but the rough estimate is somewhere around 200 meters across. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5410.66s)]
*  What do they think it is? [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5414.06s)]
*  It's a structure. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5415.780000000001s)]
*  That's what I think it is. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5417.34s)]
*  I don't think it can be anything other than a structure. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5418.3s)]
*  What does Elon think it is? [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5420.42s)]
*  He thought it was wild. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5423.46s)]
*  Has he commented on it? [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5425.0s)]
*  I mean, I sent him a text message [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5426.1s)]
*  that said imagine if you go up there [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5427.740000000001s)]
*  and you find evidence of a previous civilization. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5428.9800000000005s)]
*  He's like, that is fucking wild. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5431.54s)]
*  It's wild because that's a real square. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5433.200000000001s)]
*  What the, yeah, that just doesn't seem like [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5435.660000000001s)]
*  that would exist naturally. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5438.22s)]
*  It doesn't seem like it's possible [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5440.5s)]
*  for it to be a perfect square. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5441.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's crazy. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5442.9s)]
*  I thought this was fake. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5444.54s)]
*  No, no, no, no, it's real. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5446.0599999999995s)]
*  It's real, it's very disturbing [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5448.099999999999s)]
*  because that's a fairly high resolution image. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5449.94s)]
*  And Elon has backed a mission to Mars [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5453.74s)]
*  to go and check that out. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5455.679999999999s)]
*  They wanna check it out. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5456.78s)]
*  See, there's an article right there from the Daily Mail. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5457.66s)]
*  Elon backs mission to Mars [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5459.54s)]
*  where he wants to send something up there to check it out. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5463.219999999999s)]
*  If you see these images, [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5467.66s)]
*  I don't think there's a chance in hell [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5469.38s)]
*  that that's not made by someone. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5470.94s)]
*  That seems very strange. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5473.22s)]
*  I don't think that nature makes a square. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5474.18s)]
*  No, I mean. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5476.0599999999995s)]
*  Is that a rectangle or a square? [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5477.62s)]
*  I mean, what are the, it looks, is it perfectly square? [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5480.1s)]
*  It might be slightly off. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5483.94s)]
*  Whatever it is, it's four right angle turns [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5485.78s)]
*  that have equal lengths. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5487.94s)]
*  Conspiracy theorists have likened the structure [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5488.78s)]
*  of the Great Pyramid in Egypt. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5490.78s)]
*  Conspiracy theorists is a nice way to put it. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5493.0599999999995s)]
*  How about just people looking at it going, [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5495.3s)]
*  what the fuck is that? [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5496.86s)]
*  I know, why do they always call them conspiracy theorists? [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5497.7s)]
*  Because they're assholes. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5500.62s)]
*  They're assholes and they work for the Daily Mail. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5502.0599999999995s)]
*  So it's right down the street from that area, [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5504.66s)]
*  which is really crazy. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5506.54s)]
*  And what do they think the face is? [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5507.38s)]
*  Just like a giant stuck in the Martian surface? [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5508.22s)]
*  I don't think anybody really thinks it's a face anymore. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5511.86s)]
*  If you scroll up and look at that image from July 1976, [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5513.98s)]
*  that image, what's interesting to me is not the face [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5516.94s)]
*  because I don't think it's a face. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5520.18s)]
*  But what's interesting to me is the shape of the base of it. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5521.58s)]
*  The shape of the base of it is weird. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5524.38s)]
*  It's flat on the bottom, equal sided and domed on the top. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5526.34s)]
*  It looks unnatural. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5529.66s)]
*  It doesn't mean it's unnatural. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5530.82s)]
*  There's a lot of shit that looks unnatural in nature [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5531.98s)]
*  that is actually natural, but not squares. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5534.46s)]
*  That giant square where it looks like building. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5537.66s)]
*  There was like a civilization there? [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5540.94s)]
*  Yes. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5543.46s)]
*  Well, the thing is Mars had a real atmosphere. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5544.42s)]
*  Mars has liquid water. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5547.98s)]
*  We know it does. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5550.82s)]
*  And at one point in time, they think that Mars [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5551.98s)]
*  was capable of sustaining life. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5555.18s)]
*  So if you imagine the planets over time [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5557.38s)]
*  get further and further away from the sun, [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5560.3s)]
*  if you go back a billion years, how much closer [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5562.46s)]
*  was Mars to the sun? [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5565.62s)]
*  And what was the temperature like? [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5566.74s)]
*  What was the atmosphere like? [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5568.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5569.58s)]
*  There's people that believe that the initial civilization [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5571.54s)]
*  escaped Mars and came to Earth. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5574.54s)]
*  Ah. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5576.46s)]
*  What about the moons of Jupiter? [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5578.74s)]
*  Well, there's one. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5581.18s)]
*  Europa or something? [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5582.18s)]
*  Yeah, Europa. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5583.18s)]
*  That's solid ice. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5583.900000000001s)]
*  And they think underneath that, well, the surface is solid ice. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5584.98s)]
*  And they think underneath that is liquid water. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5587.94s)]
*  And liquid water is capable of supporting life. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5589.74s)]
*  So it's possible, especially when [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5591.9s)]
*  you see those thermal vents that they [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5594.0199999999995s)]
*  find in the bottom of the ocean that [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5596.099999999999s)]
*  sustain some form of life. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5597.459999999999s)]
*  There might be some form of life inside the oceans of Europa. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5598.86s)]
*  Are you joking about all this stuff? [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5601.98s)]
*  No. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5603.7s)]
*  No, I'm not joking about Mars. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5604.419999999999s)]
*  That image, it sounds really crazy. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5605.86s)]
*  Are you joking about it on stage? [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5608.419999999999s)]
*  Sometimes. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5610.0199999999995s)]
*  I used to have this whole bit about Mars. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5610.54s)]
*  But there's places in America that you can't live to. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5612.86s)]
*  Like, go to Death Valley. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5615.299999999999s)]
*  Look around. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5616.38s)]
*  Sucks, right? [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5616.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5617.54s)]
*  No one lives here. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5617.74s)]
*  That's because it sucks. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5618.66s)]
*  Get out of here. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5619.98s)]
*  You're not going to fix that. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5620.9s)]
*  And you're going to go fix Mars. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5622.259999999999s)]
*  I mean, I have no desire. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5623.66s)]
*  The whole planet has no air. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5624.66s)]
*  Yeah, no. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5626.0599999999995s)]
*  It's not appealing to me at all. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5626.74s)]
*  Some people, you watch these documentaries. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5628.0199999999995s)]
*  And they're like, I think of Mars like my second home. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5630.0199999999995s)]
*  And I want to go live there. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5632.66s)]
*  I'm like, it sounds horrible. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5634.46s)]
*  They also think they're a cat. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5635.66s)]
*  I'm also a foxkin. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5637.5s)]
*  Space just feels claustrophobic to me, [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5640.139999999999s)]
*  even though it's vast. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5642.18s)]
*  Until you can build things that make it feel a little more, [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5644.54s)]
*  like, I just am like, I don't want to get in a tube [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5648.740000000001s)]
*  and go live in a, do you watch Silo? [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5651.860000000001s)]
*  No, I haven't watched it. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5654.820000000001s)]
*  I love Silo. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5655.820000000001s)]
*  I love anything that's post-apocalyptic show, [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5657.02s)]
*  where people are living in a wasteland or in some weird. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5660.5s)]
*  And they're underground in all these silos. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5664.5s)]
*  And they all have to live. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5667.42s)]
*  And there's people at the bottom. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5669.06s)]
*  But it's definitely, they're like, [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5672.9400000000005s)]
*  they've never seen the sun. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5674.5s)]
*  They've never seen the sky. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5676.1s)]
*  It's like they have an alternate history [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5678.54s)]
*  that's been kind of told to them. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5681.26s)]
*  Jesus. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5683.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5684.3s)]
*  Yeah, that's all possible. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5684.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's like a post-nuclear world, [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5686.1s)]
*  like when the AI gets smart and nukes us all. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5688.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but how are we going to get vitamin D down there? [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5692.26s)]
*  It's not good. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5694.580000000001s)]
*  They have plants and trees. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5695.3s)]
*  You don't get vitamin D from plants? [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5697.26s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5699.42s)]
*  Like, burned the boat and all of your stuff, [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5701.58s)]
*  or are you just kind of having fun rebuilding? [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5703.78s)]
*  What do you mean? [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5707.5s)]
*  Now that you just did all your material. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5709.18s)]
*  Oh, stand-up-wise? [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5711.14s)]
*  Yeah, just having fun. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5712.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5713.58s)]
*  Trying to come up with a new hour and fucking around. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5714.46s)]
*  It's so fun. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5717.46s)]
*  It's a weird time for comedy. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5718.62s)]
*  Do you think? [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5723.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5724.42s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5725.42s)]
*  Well, it's a really good time for comedy. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5726.26s)]
*  Well, yeah, I feel like it's a great time. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5727.34s)]
*  Yeah, there's so much information. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5729.22s)]
*  But it's a weird time, too, because the center of comedy [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5730.86s)]
*  has now moved to Texas. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5733.9s)]
*  That's awesome. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5735.099999999999s)]
*  So that's weird. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5735.58s)]
*  That's a crazy thing. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5736.9s)]
*  That's your fault. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5737.82s)]
*  And it's also moved online, which is also a crazy thing. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5738.34s)]
*  The main promotional aspect of comedy is now online. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5741.139999999999s)]
*  I heard Jesselneck talking about this, [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5744.7s)]
*  about being like a Clips comic. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5746.82s)]
*  I saw a clip of him going around talking [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5750.34s)]
*  about being a Clips comic and how ironic. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5752.9s)]
*  Yeah, it was very meta. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5755.62s)]
*  But he was talking about how before people would recognize [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5759.78s)]
*  him in the old ways. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5762.86s)]
*  And now people recognize him. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5765.099999999999s)]
*  He said it's like a different level of fame [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5767.94s)]
*  from when he was famous before just for stand up. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5769.58s)]
*  Now he's like the Clips guy. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5772.78s)]
*  But I think that's like everyone, right? [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5774.38s)]
*  It's just a different medium. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5777.3s)]
*  That's all it is. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5778.58s)]
*  I've talked to a lot of people. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5779.5s)]
*  It's no different than you being on some Comedy Central show. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5780.7s)]
*  It's just way more impactful. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5783.139999999999s)]
*  I've talked to a lot of people about how the videos, [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5784.86s)]
*  the crowd work videos have changed crowds. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5789.26s)]
*  Because now crowds think they're helping you by chiming in. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5794.54s)]
*  And so it's like actually most, [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5798.54s)]
*  cause it's some crazy percentage of people [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5800.38s)]
*  who have never been to a comedy show at a comedy show. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5802.9400000000005s)]
*  Like a very high percentage of people have never been [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5806.66s)]
*  to a comedy show at every comedy show. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5809.3s)]
*  Isn't that weird? [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5812.34s)]
*  It's like quite high. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5813.18s)]
*  Interesting, right? [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5814.38s)]
*  So they're accustomed to seeing like, [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5815.22s)]
*  the crowd work stuff. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5817.94s)]
*  Matt Rife stuff. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5818.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5819.74s)]
*  And so they think they're actually helping you [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5820.58s)]
*  by heckling so that you can get your. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5823.0599999999995s)]
*  I don't think they think they're helping you. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5825.62s)]
*  I think they want to be heard. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5826.7s)]
*  They want to be a part of it. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5828.3s)]
*  That's the way they get in. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5829.38s)]
*  I'm helping. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5830.74s)]
*  You just want to chime in. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5832.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5834.5s)]
*  I saw some video clip of some lady losing her shit [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5835.34s)]
*  on some guy in the audience. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5838.0199999999995s)]
*  Oh, I saw this. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5838.98s)]
*  Yeah, it was very weird. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5839.82s)]
*  And everyone was like, this is amazing. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5841.42s)]
*  It's not really amazing. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5843.3s)]
*  I was like, it seems like upsetting. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5845.34s)]
*  It's also not very well handled. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5849.5s)]
*  Like the whole experience is not expertly, [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5851.54s)]
*  there's not a lot of humor in there. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5854.780000000001s)]
*  People love it. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5857.46s)]
*  They're like, yeah, this is comedy. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5858.38s)]
*  It's subjective, I guess. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5861.38s)]
*  Some people look at that and they're like. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5862.54s)]
*  Well, that's not comedy. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5863.38s)]
*  That's just people talking. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5864.22s)]
*  And one person with a microphone and power [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5866.14s)]
*  and one person in the audience is like challenging that [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5868.1s)]
*  and give me the microphone and it's fuck you. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5870.900000000001s)]
*  It's wild, like the clips thing. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5874.06s)]
*  The clips are like feeding the algorithm. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5876.02s)]
*  It's freaking, it's such a crazy thing to me. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5879.740000000001s)]
*  Well, that's with everything, right? [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5882.820000000001s)]
*  Clips from podcasts are way more popular [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5884.26s)]
*  than the podcasts themselves. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5886.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5887.18s)]
*  So many clips go viral on X. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5888.02s)]
*  Do you think TikTok's gonna be banned? [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5891.3s)]
*  No. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5893.46s)]
*  No, they'll keep it? [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5894.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5895.620000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think so. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5896.9800000000005s)]
*  The fucking president uses it. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5898.580000000001s)]
*  I met the fucking CEO of TikTok [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5900.900000000001s)]
*  when I was at the inauguration. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5902.94s)]
*  What was that like? [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5904.42s)]
*  Like being in Satan's balls. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5905.66s)]
*  Where? [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5909.82s)]
*  Just going to the actual fucking. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5911.46s)]
*  Inauguration? [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5913.7s)]
*  The actual house of government, [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5914.82s)]
*  being in the actual buildings where all this stuff [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5918.099999999999s)]
*  gets done, it's very, very strange. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5920.46s)]
*  How long were you there? [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5923.219999999999s)]
*  Couple days. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5924.46s)]
*  And so you went to the, like some of the balls, the balls. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5925.5s)]

*  They don't care who you're talking to. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5939.34s)]
*  Everybody was like super pushy. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5941.900000000001s)]
*  It's all very transactional. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5943.860000000001s)]
*  Everybody needs to get on your podcast [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5945.660000000001s)]
*  and needs to talk to you about a thing. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5947.820000000001s)]

*  It's like everything's exhausting. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5950.46s)]
*  And everybody's wealthy. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5952.46s)]
*  And they're also, they spent a lot of money to get there. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5954.26s)]

*  So there's like tons of people, [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5960.06s)]
*  thousands of people who donated a million dollars. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5960.9s)]
*  Just to be there. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5963.66s)]
*  Just to be there. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5964.5s)]
*  And they're all fucking just super enthusiastic [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5966.0199999999995s)]
*  because their team just won. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5970.179999999999s)]
*  And it's the inauguration of the president [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5972.179999999999s)]
*  and Kid Rock's there and everybody was going crazy. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5974.179999999999s)]
*  And it was fun for a while. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5976.58s)]
*  It was me and Tony Hinchcliffe and Theo Vaughn and- [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5978.179999999999s)]
*  Lex. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5982.46s)]
*  Logan Paul was there. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5983.299999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah, I saw that. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5984.46s)]
*  And Jake Paul. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5985.299999999999s)]
*  And we were all having a good old time. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5986.9s)]
*  We were laughing and having fun. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5988.62s)]
*  And then too many people just started swarming us. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5991.02s)]
*  And then it was just like, [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5993.62s)]
*  you're dealing with like 10,000 people in this room [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5994.74s)]
*  and you can't move. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5996.86s)]
*  You can't go anywhere. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5997.7s)]
*  Right. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5998.54s)]
*  And it got crazy. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=5999.38s)]
*  You couldn't have a conversation. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6000.22s)]
*  You had to just try to get out of there. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6001.62s)]
*  Was the inauguration like moving? [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6004.02s)]
*  Was it, did you- [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6007.06s)]
*  Fascinating. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6008.34s)]
*  Was it weird to be part of all that like pump and- [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6009.62s)]
*  Oh yeah, it was very weird. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6012.86s)]
*  Very, very- [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6014.38s)]
*  Were you in the main- [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6015.22s)]
*  Oh, I was on the stage. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6016.44s)]
*  I was in the fifth row. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6017.82s)]

*  Yeah, I was like- [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6023.14s)]
*  Looking at Lauren Sanchez's tits. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6023.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6025.46s)]
*  I could have thrown a pebble and hit Hillary Clinton [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6026.46s)]
*  in the head. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6028.5s)]
*  Oh. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6029.34s)]
*  They were right there. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6030.18s)]
*  It was weird. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6031.54s)]
*  It's first of all, it's weird watching like Bill Clinton [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6032.38s)]
*  walk into a room. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6035.22s)]
*  Right. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6036.34s)]
*  He's real. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6037.18s)]
*  That's him. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6038.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6038.9800000000005s)]
*  All the shit that guy's escaped. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6039.82s)]
*  And there he is right there. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6041.3s)]
*  Hello TV, hey, how you doing? [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6042.62s)]
*  Good to see you. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6044.7s)]
*  Good to see you. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6045.62s)]
*  You do good emotions. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6046.46s)]
*  Weird. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6047.42s)]
*  It's weird. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6048.24s)]
*  It's weird seeing those people. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6049.72s)]
*  It's funny they let you in there. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6050.5599999999995s)]
*  And then realizing that they're, I know, right? [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6051.4s)]
*  Whenever I'm in situations like that, [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6054.5599999999995s)]
*  I'm like, why are they letting me in here? [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6056.08s)]
*  They should know better. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6058.68s)]
*  I thought of that a little, but you know, it's cool. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6059.64s)]
*  It was weird. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6063.96s)]
*  You only get to be at one of those maybe once in your life [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6064.8s)]
*  if you're really lucky. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6068.36s)]
*  Especially that one, which was indoors, [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6069.5599999999995s)]
*  because it was insanely cold outside. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6071.24s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6072.6s)]
*  That seems like probably better for security. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6073.6s)]
*  Oh yeah, it was cold as fuck outside too. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6075.36s)]
*  Definitely better for security. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6078.44s)]
*  But it was very cold outside and windy and shit. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6079.839999999999s)]
*  Is it weird to be, like, I don't know. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6082.679999999999s)]
*  I was looking at all the people up there [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6085.4s)]
*  and it was just, it seems like it's so much, [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6087.24s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6090.839999999999s)]
*  It seems like it's just like, is everyone kissing the ring? [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6091.96s)]
*  Does it feel kind of like, you know what I mean? [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6096.4s)]
*  Is it like a, I don't know. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6099.36s)]
*  If, does it feel kind of gross or is it, [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6101.759999999999s)]
*  was it like cool? [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6105.48s)]
*  Well, it feels strange, right? [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6107.04s)]
*  It feels strange that it's real. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6109.4s)]
*  It also feels strange that we're standing up [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6111.24s)]
*  because there's a standing ovation every like 15 seconds. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6113.24s)]
*  We're gonna turn the Gulf of Mexico [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6116.56s)]
*  and the Gulf of America and we're all standing up. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6118.48s)]
*  Fuck yeah, we're gonna do that. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6120.96s)]
*  Woo! [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6122.72s)]
*  It was fun watching George Bush. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6124.48s)]
*  George Bush was the only guy clapping. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6126.08s)]
*  He was having a good time. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6127.56s)]
*  All the other presidents looked deeply disturbed. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6128.4s)]
*  Kamala Harris had this like, this motherfucker [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6130.72s)]
*  look on her face the entire time, like, [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6133.16s)]
*  she sat there like this the entire time. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6135.68s)]
*  Well, I mean. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6138.04s)]
*  Very upset. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6138.88s)]
*  Obviously. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6139.700000000001s)]
*  Well, also he's talking about how bad they sucked. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6140.68s)]
*  And she lost. And they're right there. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6143.64s)]
*  And she has to sit there. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6145.320000000001s)]
*  And she's sitting right next to Biden, who's. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6146.52s)]
*  Who's not there. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6149.0s)]
*  Look, he's just gone. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6150.04s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6151.400000000001s)]
*  And then behind them is Obama and George W. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6152.240000000001s)]
*  That's wild, man. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6156.72s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. I was like, I hope there's like a, [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6158.280000000001s)]
*  you know, what's that called when there's like [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6160.240000000001s)]
*  the extra person or whatever, [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6162.400000000001s)]
*  the designated survivor. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6164.44s)]
*  I'm like. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6166.16s)]
*  Yeah, cause they're all in the room. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6167.16s)]
*  There's a lot of people. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6168.0s)]
*  You could really fuck America up right now. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6168.82s)]
*  One bomb. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6170.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6171.6s)]
*  Yeah, I think they're aware of that. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6172.44s)]
*  I think there's probably steps taken [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6173.36s)]
*  to make sure that the skies are clear. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6174.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6176.36s)]
*  But it's very strange, but also kind of exciting. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6177.2s)]
*  Cause like, if he really does get to do all this stuff, [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6183.16s)]
*  like if we really do see radical change, [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6185.4800000000005s)]
*  it seems like that's what's happening. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6187.88s)]
*  And if Bobby Kennedy really does get in, [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6189.64s)]
*  and if Tulsi Gabbard really does get in, [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6191.4s)]
*  this is a crazy time. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6193.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6195.44s)]
*  This is like an unprecedented cabinet of people [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6196.599999999999s)]
*  that are kind of unified and all know each other. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6199.759999999999s)]
*  They're all friends. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6202.36s)]
*  And it's also kind of by part, like RFK Jr. brought, [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6203.84s)]
*  he brought so many people over. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6207.639999999999s)]
*  I know so many people who were not gonna vote for Trump, [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6209.24s)]
*  but then when he kind of brought RFK Jr. over, [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6211.799999999999s)]
*  they were like, all right. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6214.92s)]
*  I mean, if he's there, and Tulsi too. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6217.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6219.16s)]
*  They were libs. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6220.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6221.92s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6223.280000000001s)]
*  That must've been pretty... [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6224.12s)]
*  I... [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6225.4400000000005s)]
*  It's bizarre. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6226.280000000001s)]
*  It's bizarre. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6227.2s)]
*  It seemed like, I was like, [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6228.2s)]
*  that must be so surreal to be there. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6229.24s)]
*  Cause it was surreal to watch it just like, [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6231.08s)]
*  when you think about the fact that he nearly got killed, [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6232.96s)]
*  like the whole sequence of events that led to that moment. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6236.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6240.52s)]
*  The debate where he just like fell apart. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6241.360000000001s)]
*  And it just was surreal to watch. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6245.0s)]
*  So I was wondering like, [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6248.0s)]
*  that must be pretty bonkers to be there. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6249.08s)]
*  He should've seen Biden, his face, the entire time. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6253.200000000001s)]
*  Like, he looked upset. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6255.72s)]
*  Like almost like he was gonna cry at one point in time. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6258.200000000001s)]
*  He looked so upset at the whole... [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6261.280000000001s)]
*  I think he thinks he could've won. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6262.4400000000005s)]
*  Do you have any fears about it? [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6264.120000000001s)]
*  Like, what about the Riviera? [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6265.72s)]
*  Oh, the Gaza thing? [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6268.56s)]
*  The Riviera. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6270.080000000001s)]
*  Riviera of the Middle East. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6271.400000000001s)]
*  You did such a good impression of it. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6272.84s)]
*  Yeah, I thought I could. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6274.4800000000005s)]
*  It's... [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6275.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6277.240000000001s)]
*  I mean, what's the alternative to that happening? [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6278.080000000001s)]
*  They're saying no US military will be there. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6281.240000000001s)]
*  The United States is gonna clean it up, rebuild it, [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6283.240000000001s)]
*  give it to the Palestinians, make it safe. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6285.72s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6287.8s)]
*  Get rid of Hamas. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6288.64s)]
*  I mean, the thing is, what Palestinians want is a state. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6290.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6293.56s)]
*  They want their own state. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6294.400000000001s)]
*  And this is like a step sort of away from that. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6295.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6297.0s)]
*  Now it'll be that section of that area [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6297.84s)]
*  is now controlled by the United States. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6301.88s)]
*  What the fuck? [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6304.6s)]
*  And Greenland. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6305.6s)]
*  Don't forget Greenland. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6306.4400000000005s)]
*  The question is like, what's the better option? [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6307.400000000001s)]
*  Give it to Hamas? [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6309.679999999999s)]
*  What's the better option? [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6310.679999999999s)]
*  Give it to the Palestinians [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6311.639999999999s)]
*  and they give it to the Islamic State? [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6312.879999999999s)]
*  Like who gets it? [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6315.32s)]
*  I'm not smart enough for any of this. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6317.12s)]
*  Also, how did you let it happen in the first place? [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6318.48s)]
*  How did this administration let them just bomb [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6321.679999999999s)]
*  the fucking shit out of all those people [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6323.719999999999s)]
*  and blow up an entire city to the point where you... [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6326.719999999999s)]
*  You could even feasibly say that you would rebuild it. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6330.44s)]
*  Because it's not like before this had happened, [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6333.24s)]
*  if anybody had ever said the United States [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6335.599999999999s)]
*  is gonna go into Gaza and completely rebuild it [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6337.24s)]
*  and make it the United States. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6341.8s)]
*  Everybody's like, fuck you. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6342.92s)]
*  You need to give that to Palestine. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6344.0s)]
*  But once you blow it up, you're like, [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6345.679999999999s)]
*  well, I guess there's nothing left. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6347.04s)]
*  Like people are pushing back against it. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6348.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6350.48s)]
*  A lot of people are upset, but not as upset as they would [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6351.32s)]
*  if they didn't blow it up. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6353.679999999999s)]
*  Oh, that's weird. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6355.08s)]
*  Yeah, because it's weird. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6356.2s)]
*  It's horrible. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6358.44s)]
*  And we've just accepted the fact [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6361.5199999999995s)]
*  that this is what Israel did. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6363.2s)]
*  For 1,200 people and 250 hostages, [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6365.56s)]
*  they killed 60,000 people. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6368.0s)]
*  Is that the actual number or is that a lost number? [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6369.64s)]
*  I don't know what the number is. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6372.4800000000005s)]
*  What's the current number of people that are dead [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6373.96s)]
*  in Gaza right now? [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6376.200000000001s)]
*  It's such a weird thing too, because Israel, [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6377.68s)]
*  I feel like has to not win a war, which is a weird thing, [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6379.96s)]
*  where they have to like, they're in a position where they... [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6383.6s)]
*  They already won the war. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6386.88s)]
*  I mean, what war? [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6387.84s)]
*  It's one army. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6389.16s)]
*  There's one army and some terrorists. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6390.4400000000005s)]
*  It's like Bill Hicks joke about Iraq. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6392.200000000001s)]
*  It's only a war when there's two armies fighting. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6394.32s)]
*  They're like, whoa, Bill, Iraq's the fourth largest army. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6396.16s)]
*  He goes, yeah, well, after the top two is a huge drop off, [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6398.96s)]
*  he's like, the Salvation Army is number three. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6402.08s)]
*  I don't want there to be war. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6405.48s)]
*  I think most people agree on that. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6407.84s)]
*  Of course, but also we don't live in Israel, right? [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6409.92s)]
*  We don't have to live with the Iron Dome, [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6412.28s)]
*  because missiles are being shot into your city [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6414.8s)]
*  and you watch them explode up in the sky, [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6417.16s)]
*  because your military has these rockets [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6419.0s)]
*  that shoot up in the sky, missiles [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6421.719999999999s)]
*  that take these fucking missiles out. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6423.72s)]
*  Yeah, I think about if it was my daughter [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6425.320000000001s)]
*  that was in some tunnel, I would be like... [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6427.6s)]
*  There'd be no length. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6430.76s)]
*  Well, that's... [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6432.2s)]
*  I know that's very selfish of me, [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6433.56s)]
*  but that is on a personal level, I'm like, [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6436.16s)]
*  I can't even imagine how I would feel [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6439.8s)]
*  in that situation as a parent. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6442.2s)]
*  Of course. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6443.68s)]
*  Well, that's the deepest conspiracy theory [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6444.84s)]
*  about why it happened in the first place, [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6446.84s)]
*  is because Netanyahu was losing power [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6448.400000000001s)]
*  and people were protesting against him in the streets, [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6450.12s)]
*  and what better way to get everybody on your side [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6452.04s)]
*  than to allow an attack to take place? [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6456.04s)]
*  That's the darkest of the false flag conspiracy theories. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6458.16s)]
*  I have a lot of people that I know [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6461.56s)]
*  who now think 9-11 was an inside job after October 7th. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6464.24s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6469.04s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6469.88s)]
*  They're like, well, if they would do it here, [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6471.16s)]
*  they would do it, why wouldn't they do it in America? [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6472.88s)]
*  It's been this kind of reverse leap. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6476.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6479.28s)]
*  Well, anytime you have a big tragedy, [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6480.2s)]
*  you're always gonna have a bunch of wild theories, [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6482.76s)]
*  but some of them are interesting. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6485.400000000001s)]
*  You know, you're supposed to dismiss them all [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6487.04s)]
*  because they're conspiracy theories, [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6490.96s)]
*  but Tower 7 is like, explain that. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6492.28s)]
*  I can't. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6495.52s)]
*  I have people in my life who are very much like, [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6496.68s)]
*  I think, truthers, I think, about this. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6502.68s)]
*  That's a weird one. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6504.8s)]
*  That's a weird one. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6506.28s)]
*  What's the conspiracy around Tower 7? [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6507.36s)]
*  Just how did it, why did it? [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6509.92s)]
*  It collapses like a controlled demolition, [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6512.240000000001s)]
*  completely into its base. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6515.4400000000005s)]
*  No building's ever done that before [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6516.88s)]
*  without being a controlled demolition. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6518.200000000001s)]
*  And it doesn't have all the signature aspects [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6520.6s)]
*  of a controlled demolition. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6524.04s)]
*  Like, if you ever watch, like, [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6525.280000000001s)]
*  when they blow up one of them Vegas casinos, super obvious. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6526.360000000001s)]
*  It goes bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6529.4800000000005s)]
*  and it all collapses. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6532.200000000001s)]
*  It doesn't have that, but it does have something similar [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6533.88s)]
*  in that the effect is the same. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6536.68s)]
*  So is it possible to do that [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6539.04s)]
*  without having it the way the casinos do it? [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6540.6s)]
*  Is there only one way to have a controlled demolition [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6543.76s)]
*  of a building? [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6545.96s)]
*  Or is it possible that just immense diesel fires [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6547.08s)]
*  weaken the structure uniformly in such a weird way [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6551.0s)]
*  that it collapsed exactly like a controlled demolition, [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6555.04s)]
*  but it's just the results of this? [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6558.76s)]
*  It's a coincidence. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6560.6s)]
*  Yeah, they had diesel generators in the basement [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6561.44s)]
*  of that thing, and the whole fucking inside of it [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6563.8s)]
*  was on fire. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6565.84s)]
*  So when you're seated on the outside, [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6567.0s)]
*  you're only seeing a little bit of fire and some holes, [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6568.28s)]
*  but the entire inside of it was in flames. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6570.28s)]
*  We're living in a simulation. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6572.28s)]
*  Maybe that. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6574.679999999999s)]
*  Maybe that's another wink. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6575.5599999999995s)]
*  Maybe that's another fucking... [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6577.04s)]
*  We didn't have social media, though, thank God, [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6579.24s)]
*  during that, can you imagine? [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6582.32s)]
*  No, but we did have plenty of people that were questioning [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6583.96s)]
*  once they saw it on television, [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6586.0s)]
*  because you saw it on TV and you're like, what is that? [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6587.36s)]
*  How does it do that? [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6589.719999999999s)]
*  But that wasn't even hit by a plane. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6590.5599999999995s)]
*  Do you remember seeing the skyline [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6592.8s)]
*  the first time you went to New York? [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6594.32s)]
*  Oh, without the Twin Towers? [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6596.0s)]
*  I don't think I actually saw it. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6598.6s)]
*  I went back in 2001. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6600.6s)]
*  I was there in 2001. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6602.84s)]
*  Maybe 2002, it was probably a couple of months after. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6604.92s)]
*  I took a train in November, [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6607.72s)]
*  and because I took the train in, [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6610.4800000000005s)]
*  I always used to take the train in from Rhode Island [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6612.0s)]
*  where I was, and it was like, [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6614.32s)]
*  it was so jarring seeing, they were so part of that. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6618.32s)]
*  They were so huge. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6621.6s)]
*  Yeah, and you just took it for granted. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6622.56s)]
*  That was the landscape. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6624.96s)]
*  And it was, I'll never forget it, how jarring it was. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6626.64s)]
*  I thought it was weird too, that when they rebuilt it, [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6629.72s)]
*  they didn't make it as tall. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6631.68s)]
*  Why didn't they? [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6633.84s)]
*  It's only one building now, it's not two. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6636.400000000001s)]
*  I know. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6638.240000000001s)]
*  And it's not as tall. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6639.08s)]
*  Like, it's pretty tall, but they didn't get crazy. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6640.4400000000005s)]
*  They didn't say, we're gonna make the biggest [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6643.400000000001s)]
*  fucking building the world's ever seen. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6644.84s)]
*  Like a middle finger to the world. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6647.240000000001s)]
*  Trump was there, he'd be like, [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6649.12s)]
*  we're gonna have two buildings on the side [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6650.12s)]
*  and one right up your ass. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6652.0s)]
*  It's like, fuck you. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6654.96s)]
*  It looks like that. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6656.719999999999s)]
*  It's smaller, smaller than the original buildings. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6660.599999999999s)]
*  I do wonder, I'm so curious about what it's gonna be like [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6663.24s)]
*  for our kids. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6666.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's what it looks like now. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6667.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6669.0s)]
*  It's the tallest building in the US still though. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6669.84s)]
*  Is it the tallest building in the US? [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6670.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but it's not as tall, right? [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6671.92s)]
*  I don't know what the height was. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6675.16s)]
*  I think it's shorter. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6676.84s)]
*  No, if it's shorter, then it would, [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6678.799999999999s)]
*  still the tallest. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6681.16s)]
*  The World Trade Center wasn't the tallest building. [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6682.0s)]
*  No, not in the world. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6683.639999999999s)]
*  No, in the US even. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6684.679999999999s)]
*  It wasn't? [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6685.96s)]
*  The Sears Tower was bigger. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6686.8s)]
*  Really? [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6688.0s)]
*  Yeah, 100%. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6688.84s)]
*  Where's the Sears Tower? [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6689.88s)]
*  Chicago. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6691.04s)]
*  That's taller than the World Trade Center? [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6692.08s)]
*  It was. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6693.72s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6694.64s)]
*  Now this is the tallest. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6695.4800000000005s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6696.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6697.16s)]
*  The Sears Tower was the tallest building [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6698.0s)]
*  in the world for a while. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6698.84s)]
*  So the twin towers were taller than the Sears Tower? [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6700.400000000001s)]
*  They were shorter. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6704.08s)]
*  They were shorter. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6704.92s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know why you're saying that I guess. [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6705.76s)]
*  Oh, it's the same, oh, it has the same name [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6709.16s)]
*  as the North Tower, other original. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6712.24s)]
*  How tall is it? [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6714.24s)]
*  It is shorter though, right, isn't it? [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6716.24s)]
*  I don't know that. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6718.6s)]
*  So the Willis Tower was the tallest one. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6719.4400000000005s)]
*  I remember people being upset when they were rebuilding it [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6721.64s)]
*  because it wasn't going to be as tall. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6725.08s)]
*  1776. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6727.96s)]
*  So 110 stories was the original one [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6729.64s)]
*  and it was, the tower was 1,350 feet high. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6734.0s)]
*  How tall is the one now? [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6739.6s)]
*  1776. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6741.64s)]
*  So it's taller? [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6742.64s)]
*  Yep. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6743.76s)]
*  Really? [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6744.6s)]
*  Wait a minute, really? [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6745.839999999999s)]
*  I don't, yep. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6747.679999999999s)]
*  Can I see the image again? [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6748.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't know where else you want me to go with this. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6749.839999999999s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6751.4s)]
*  Because they cheat with that big pole at the top? [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6752.799999999999s)]
*  I mean, that's the 100, they do that with all of them. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6755.0s)]
*  The other one had a big pole on top too. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6756.879999999999s)]
*  But isn't that to stop lightning bolts? [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6758.48s)]
*  Some of it, some of it's antenna stuff. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6760.5599999999995s)]
*  Some of it's talk to aliens. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6762.44s)]
*  Some of it's cell phone tower information. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6763.919999999999s)]
*  Okay, I'm wrong, I thought it was shorter. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6766.2s)]
*  Maybe what it was saying, they were saying is it's smaller [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6769.799999999999s)]
*  because there's only one instead of two. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6772.919999999999s)]
*  The spire makes it 1776. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6774.68s)]
*  The spire, yeah, how tall is that fucking spire? [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6776.56s)]
*  In that video too, I was just, [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6779.0s)]
*  the spire of the World Trade Center, I never saw this, [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6779.84s)]
*  it's just saying that's what made tower seven fall. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6782.160000000001s)]
*  It made a gash. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6785.280000000001s)]
*  What? [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6788.76s)]
*  What made a gash? [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6789.6s)]
*  The spire on the tower here fell [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6790.6s)]
*  and made a gash down the side and started a fire here. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6793.360000000001s)]
*  And tower seven, I've never seen this video. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6796.6s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6798.240000000001s)]
*  I was just looking through it to see what the... [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6799.4400000000005s)]
*  Well, that's one thing with the video that we saw. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6801.72s)]
*  Oh, look at that, interesting. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6804.52s)]
*  I have photos of what that, [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6807.2s)]
*  I don't think they have an actual video of that happening. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6809.360000000001s)]
*  Oh, it fell and fucked up the building, but still. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6812.360000000001s)]
*  Still, why didn't it just fall into that side? [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6817.68s)]
*  Why does it compress into its base? [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6820.52s)]
*  The way it collapses, [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6822.96s)]
*  I've never seen anybody adequately describe it. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6824.08s)]
*  But one thing that people should know [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6826.280000000001s)]
*  is that the top of it collapsed [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6828.28s)]
*  before the whole thing collapsed. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6830.12s)]
*  There was this piece on the top, [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6832.0s)]
*  so the roof caved in first. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6834.36s)]
*  There's a smaller structure on top of the roof [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6838.08s)]
*  that imploded and went through the base. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6840.96s)]
*  And then the whole thing went under. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6844.2s)]
*  So it wasn't like it all went in one shot. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6845.76s)]
*  The top of it had already collapsed and went through. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6848.04s)]
*  God, that was such a weird time in America. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6850.599999999999s)]
*  I was thinking about how just catatonic I was on the catwalk [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6852.84s)]
*  on the couch recently, [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6858.12s)]
*  that whole week afterwards. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6861.64s)]
*  Just nobody. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6863.5599999999995s)]
*  I know. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6865.36s)]
*  Because it's weird. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6866.4s)]
*  I have family members who have kids, [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6867.36s)]
*  and their kids are now, [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6868.84s)]
*  they were born right around that time. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6871.16s)]
*  They were one, two years old. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6872.68s)]
*  They've grown up. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6874.0s)]
*  They don't remember what it was like before that. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6875.16s)]
*  I don't know, I feel like the world, [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6880.5199999999995s)]
*  I have a friend and he's like, [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6882.12s)]
*  everything went to shit after 9-11. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6883.12s)]
*  Everything just got shittier. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6884.96s)]
*  Well, everything did go to shit [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6886.28s)]
*  because that's when they passed the Patriot Act. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6887.28s)]
*  And that's when the government really got its hooks [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6889.36s)]
*  into your information. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6891.32s)]
*  Clarification here. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6892.32s)]
*  New one, 1776, 541 meters tall. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6893.679999999999s)]
*  Old one. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6898.4s)]
*  With the spire was 1730, [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6899.679999999999s)]
*  but was 17, or 1368 without the spire. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6901.5199999999995s)]
*  Okay. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6906.88s)]
*  The spire adds, without the antenna of the building, [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6907.719999999999s)]
*  is 417 meters tall. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6909.719999999999s)]
*  So I think you were close. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6911.4s)]
*  Okay. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6912.84s)]
*  That's what you were saying right there. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6913.679999999999s)]
*  So it's not much different though. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6914.5s)]
*  I thought it was a lot different. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6915.639999999999s)]
*  It's like 10 stories or some shit. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6917.88s)]
*  So it's 104 floors. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6919.36s)]
*  And four basement floors. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6922.8s)]
*  And the other one was 110 floors. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6923.76s)]
*  And I don't know how many basement floors. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6926.04s)]
*  Also, it's like how tall are the floors? [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6927.84s)]
*  I hope this one doesn't fuck up. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6931.8s)]
*  Do you think this administration's [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6933.64s)]
*  gonna try and get rid of the Patriot Act? [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6934.48s)]
*  No. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6936.88s)]
*  No. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6939.16s)]
*  No, why would they do that? [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6940.16s)]
*  I think they have those tools and power to actually, [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6941.6s)]
*  they'll use it as an excuse to go get terrorists. [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6945.6s)]
*  Yeah, but haven't we all wanted to get rid of it [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6948.160000000001s)]
*  for a long time? [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6950.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6952.360000000001s)]
*  Well then they have the Patriot Act too, [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6953.240000000001s)]
*  which is even more invasive. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6955.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6956.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6957.200000000001s)]
*  But people, like that seems like a bipartisan thing, [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6958.02s)]
*  somebody could get behind. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6960.3s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6961.56s)]
*  But the real neocons will come out [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6962.400000000001s)]
*  and say that weakens us against our enemies. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6965.400000000001s)]
*  We need this power to be able to find terrorists [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6970.52s)]
*  and to be able to search out. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6972.76s)]
*  That was one of the things that the Obama administration, [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6974.54s)]
*  when they passed the NDAA, [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6978.14s)]
*  they go, we're not gonna do it. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6980.58s)]
*  We're not gonna just detain people indefinitely. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6981.9400000000005s)]
*  We wouldn't do it. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6985.9800000000005s)]
*  But the problem is you're giving the law, [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6986.9400000000005s)]
*  that law is now in the books, [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6988.860000000001s)]
*  and now the next person, what if it's a psycho? [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6990.46s)]
*  And the person after that, what if it's a psycho? [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6992.9400000000005s)]
*  Right. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6995.18s)]
*  Now you've given them power to become a dictator. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6996.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6998.66s)]
*  And go after their political enemies, [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=6999.4800000000005s)]
*  which normal people won't do, right? [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7000.92s)]
*  You guys don't do that, right? [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7003.2s)]
*  I mean, it's gonna be a wild four years, I think. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7004.8s)]
*  Cause I did think that, I figured, [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7010.92s)]
*  I thought maybe that people would understand [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7015.16s)]
*  that they were wrong and that maybe they'd gone too far. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7018.44s)]
*  And I was, and it seems like hysteria. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7021.76s)]
*  I don't think people learn that good. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7026.76s)]
*  I think people learn by having their lives ruined [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7028.96s)]
*  and getting really angry. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7031.24s)]
*  And then they change course. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7032.879999999999s)]
*  But I think the people that are still comfortable [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7034.12s)]
*  and still working in these environments [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7037.2s)]
*  that still cling to these ideas, [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7039.5s)]
*  they're gonna double down and wear a pussy hat [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7042.759999999999s)]
*  and fucking paint their hair blue. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7045.08s)]
*  And protest in the streets. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7047.839999999999s)]
*  I thought we passed all this. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7048.679999999999s)]
*  It's so weird cause I was thinking about [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7049.799999999999s)]
*  how I've now been 10 years in the culture wars, [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7051.379999999999s)]
*  which is not, I mean, I kind of stumbled into them. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7056.2s)]
*  Are you a sergeant now? [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7060.08s)]
*  What are you? [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7061.04s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7061.88s)]
*  Yeah, I think I'm a, are you a general? [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7062.72s)]
*  I don't know what I am. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7066.84s)]
*  I've been, but it has been a weird decade to be, [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7068.56s)]
*  I didn't wanna, I think so many normies are like me. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7073.12s)]
*  They just got kind of forced into being in them. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7076.3s)]
*  It wasn't like, I was like a drunk waitress [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7080.400000000001s)]
*  who just wanted to tell jokes. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7082.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7084.400000000001s)]
*  And then I started writing for Playboy. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7085.92s)]
*  And next thing I know, [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7088.32s)]
*  voting for Trump. [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7092.12s)]
*  Well, as a drunk waitress, you're one of us. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7094.16s)]
*  You're a human. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7098.2s)]
*  And humans, there's a lot of people [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7099.32s)]
*  that have opinions and ideas on things. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7100.8s)]
*  They're just not good at articulating it, [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7102.56s)]
*  or they never learned how to articulate it. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7104.52s)]
*  But everybody does what we do, [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7106.8s)]
*  or everybody can do what we do. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7108.56s)]
*  They do it with their friends. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7110.72s)]
*  They talk with their friends. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7111.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7113.28s)]
*  They bullshit about stuff. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7114.12s)]
*  And it's just a process of putting it out there. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7114.96s)]
*  I've had some weird YouTube strikes [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7119.96s)]
*  that I'd say, yes, it's easy to do, [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7124.08s)]
*  except I've had to play 10 years of a game [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7126.4800000000005s)]
*  of outrunning censors and like, [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7129.44s)]
*  Patreon, okay, we're there. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7132.28s)]
*  And then we've gotta get off there [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7134.0s)]
*  because I don't wanna put all my eggs in that basket [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7135.16s)]
*  in case they go bonkers and shut it down. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7136.96s)]
*  And then I feel like a lot of people in this space [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7139.82s)]
*  have been for a decade out. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7143.04s)]
*  We're like, how are we gonna, [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7145.72s)]
*  we got the dumbest strike on an old ad of ours. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7147.2s)]
*  And it was something that we said. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7151.4s)]
*  And then you have to go to, [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7154.16s)]
*  you've gotta go to class and get reeducated. [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7156.2s)]
*  Jamie got reeducated. [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7159.4s)]
*  Didn't you, Jamie? [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7160.5199999999995s)]
*  You feel better right now, right? [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7161.36s)]
*  You feel smarter now you got reeducated by YouTube? [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7162.92s)]
*  What did you get reeducated for? [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7164.76s)]
*  Which part of YouTube? [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7166.0s)]
*  All of it. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7166.84s)]
*  He got reeducated. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7167.68s)]
*  Sure, I guess. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7168.5s)]
*  Didn't you, when we had a strike, [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7169.34s)]
*  you had to do the little classes? [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7170.16s)]
*  Oh, that's what you're talking about. [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7171.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7172.0s)]
*  He's like, what reeducation? [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7172.84s)]
*  He got reeducated. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7174.8s)]
*  He's different now. What far? [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7175.639999999999s)]
*  He's better now. [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7176.919999999999s)]
*  Yeah, because we told factual information about COVID-19. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7177.919999999999s)]
*  And so you got a strike? [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7181.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it was because it was like a long time ago. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7182.919999999999s)]
*  Oh, but ours is weird because it was like a very old episode. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7184.719999999999s)]
*  So they must be like trolling. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7189.12s)]
*  I don't know what they're doing. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7191.679999999999s)]
*  They're probably just using their algorithm [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7192.599999999999s)]
*  and going after everything. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7194.839999999999s)]
*  Ours literally, we said, [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7196.28s)]
*  think for yourself and come to your own conclusions. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7198.28s)]
*  Oh, that's dangerous. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7201.16s)]
*  That was the ad. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7202.5199999999995s)]
*  It wasn't even ours on our, [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7203.599999999999s)]
*  I guess it was an ad we were doing [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7205.08s)]
*  for someone else's podcast. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7206.6s)]
*  Shouldn't give that advice out. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7208.44s)]
*  People shouldn't be doing that. [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7210.48s)]
*  But this is why it's hard for people [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7212.04s)]
*  to just like say what they want. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7213.8s)]
*  Well, what do you think is gonna happen [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7215.84s)]
*  when you're looking at all this crazy shit right now [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7217.2s)]
*  with Doge and the uncovering of USAID [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7219.7s)]
*  and this dismantling of this bizarre left-wing ecosystem [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7223.24s)]
*  that's pretty much manufactured? [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7228.94s)]
*  Like, what do you see is gonna happen [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7230.2s)]
*  with the rest of the country? [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7232.48s)]
*  I mean, look, there are a lot of people [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7234.2s)]
*  who did not vote for Trump. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7236.72s)]
*  He won, and yes, he won every swing state. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7239.28s)]
*  Half the country's a lot of people. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7243.04s)]
*  Yeah, it's a lot of people. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7244.28s)]
*  And I'm not sure how many of them, [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7246.36s)]
*  I wonder how many, so I have a couple questions. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7248.5199999999995s)]
*  How many people didn't vote for Trump and wanted to [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7250.7s)]
*  and are secretly glad he won? [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7253.28s)]
*  I bet there's a pretty significant number of those people [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7255.04s)]
*  who either didn't vote or didn't vote for him [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7257.72s)]
*  but wanted him to win anyway. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7260.139999999999s)]
*  Ari says that. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7261.76s)]
*  Ari says that New York City is relaxed. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7262.64s)]
*  It's like everybody was relaxed after the election. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7265.4400000000005s)]
*  Even the liberals are like, whew. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7267.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, thank God. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7268.76s)]
*  They're like, woo! [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7269.64s)]
*  Yeah, like, thank you, God, you saved me from myself. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7270.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7272.8s)]
*  Because it's God doing for us [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7273.64s)]
*  what we can't do for ourselves. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7275.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, so there's that, I wonder, [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7276.88s)]
*  but then I do wonder how many of the people are, [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7278.64s)]
*  what I worry about is how much mental, [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7281.64s)]
*  this is where I get mad at the media [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7284.56s)]
*  for presenting this like, this is Hitler, [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7286.76s)]
*  having it notched up to 11 for the past eight years [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7290.36s)]
*  and now you've got this, because he was put in, [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7295.08s)]
*  it's almost like that energy has been transferred [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7299.639999999999s)]
*  to Elon now because now, do you see the Elon protests? [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7303.24s)]
*  They're protesting Elon. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7307.12s)]
*  They're literally standing out there with signs [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7308.86s)]
*  that say arrest Elon Musk. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7311.2s)]
*  Listen, I guarantee it's organized. [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7313.12s)]
*  I guarantee it's organized by the same people [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7314.84s)]
*  that are gonna lose a shitload of money [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7316.88s)]
*  based on all these discoveries at Doge. [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7319.04s)]
*  There's no way they're not. [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7322.2s)]
*  If you look at what Doge is uncovering, [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7323.38s)]
*  what they're uncovering with this USAID stuff, [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7325.92s)]
*  a lot of that stuff was organizing through NGOs protests. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7327.92s)]
*  They organized the attempt at getting Trump impeached. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7332.96s)]
*  I thought you were gonna say killed. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7337.64s)]
*  They organized the impeachment. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7338.76s)]
*  I was like, if that's come out. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7339.6s)]
*  They also spent, USAID spent $50 million on the lab [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7341.12s)]
*  that invented coronavirus. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7345.28s)]
*  Right. Yeah. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7347.72s)]
*  There's a lot of money involved in this not working. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7349.52s)]
*  And when you have a lot of money involved, [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7352.4800000000005s)]
*  you're gonna have organized protest. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7354.400000000001s)]
*  When you see protests, we all wanna think protests [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7356.24s)]
*  like the 1960s. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7359.24s)]
*  Yeah, fight the war, man. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7360.24s)]
*  It's like organic, like peace, love and hippie shit. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7361.8s)]
*  But that's not what this is. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7365.400000000001s)]
*  What this is is organized funded protests [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7366.56s)]
*  where someone is spending a lot of money [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7370.64s)]
*  and they're mobilizing other NGOs. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7372.46s)]
*  They're using their access to these mailing lists [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7375.0s)]
*  and all these different things. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7378.28s)]
*  They're putting these things together. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7379.16s)]
*  Yeah, but do you think that the average liberal person, [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7381.719999999999s)]
*  do you think that they're gonna wake up and come around? [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7386.719999999999s)]
*  Or do you think that they're gonna be in agony [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7389.8s)]
*  for four years and be- [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7392.0s)]
*  What if it works? [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7393.88s)]
*  What if the world gets safer, the country gets safer, [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7394.7s)]
*  the economy improves and they don't attack civil rights, [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7397.5199999999995s)]
*  women's rights, gay rights, [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7400.679999999999s)]
*  all these things that everybody's worried about. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7402.0s)]
*  And then at the end of it, you realize, [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7403.4s)]
*  hey, maybe I was wrong. [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7405.4s)]
*  That's my question though. [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7407.8s)]
*  Are they capable of that kind of self-reflection? [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7409.12s)]
*  What we're saying they is if it's one different, [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7413.56s)]
*  like one kind of person. [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7416.4s)]
*  No, I mean- [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7417.68s)]
*  There's so many different people in they. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7418.5199999999995s)]
*  Agreed. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7420.44s)]
*  I mean, when I say they, I mean people who have bought [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7421.28s)]
*  into the idea that this person is going to make everything [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7426.16s)]
*  worse and we're going to slip into a fascist technocracy. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7429.64s)]
*  Some of them. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7433.6s)]
*  Some of them are gonna slip right into it. [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7434.599999999999s)]
*  Some of them are gonna wake up and come around. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7438.08s)]
*  It's a test. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7441.16s)]
*  It's a test of character. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7442.0s)]
*  It's a test of objectivity. [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7443.28s)]
*  It's a test of introspection. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7445.28s)]
*  There's a lot of things that are gonna happen [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7447.5199999999995s)]
*  where people are gonna have to wonder, [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7449.16s)]
*  what was I rooting for? [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7451.0s)]
*  When I was rooting for this progressive liberal government, [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7452.679999999999s)]
*  what was I actually rooting for? [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7454.799999999999s)]
*  Was I rooting for warmongers who were making insane amounts [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7456.12s)]
*  of profit by funding overseas wars? [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7459.759999999999s)]
*  What was I rooting for? [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7462.919999999999s)]
*  Was I rooting for a basic theft of our tax dollars [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7465.2s)]
*  that's gone to all these completely useless endeavors [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7469.719999999999s)]
*  that were only set up as ways to pill for money? [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7474.32s)]
*  Or the fall of America. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7477.32s)]
*  You know, this is a weird thing to hate your own country [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7478.759999999999s)]
*  so much that you want it to fall [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7481.92s)]
*  or the dismantling of the life, the kind of West [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7485.32s)]
*  as we know it. [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7490.36s)]
*  I think there is a feeling that Elon [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7491.64s)]
*  might have saved the West. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7496.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think he did. [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7499.8s)]
*  I feel like at least he's trying to. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7500.64s)]
*  I think he did. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7502.72s)]
*  I think he did, but just by buying X. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7503.56s)]
*  But isn't it funny that he got forced into it? [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7505.88s)]
*  I think there's something kind of ironic. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7508.52s)]
*  Well, funny because he was trying to get it [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7510.76s)]
*  at a lower price because he knew that they were bullshitting [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7511.76s)]
*  about the amount of bots. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7514.360000000001s)]
*  Well, and then they came out yesterday [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7515.4400000000005s)]
*  and now it's profitable. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7517.12s)]
*  There was a whole article about how he turned it around. [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7518.92s)]
*  Of course it's gonna be profitable. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7522.400000000001s)]
*  He's smarter than you. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7523.240000000001s)]
*  He is smarter. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7524.080000000001s)]
*  He also knows that we are all. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7524.92s)]
*  Tapped in. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7527.040000000001s)]
*  Oh, I can't stop it. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7527.88s)]
*  I've always had a Twitter addiction. [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7530.0s)]
*  It's the thing that replaced my drinking [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7533.120000000001s)]
*  and smoking weed when I quit that. [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7536.56s)]
*  I went right to Twitter. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7538.4800000000005s)]
*  I was like, Elon knows none of these motherfuckers, [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7539.84s)]
*  even when they go to Blue Sky, [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7542.240000000001s)]
*  they've all got secret accounts [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7543.320000000001s)]
*  and they're lurking on Twitter still or X still or whatever. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7544.84s)]
*  You can't live in that echo chamber, [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7547.96s)]
*  that Blue Sky echo chamber. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7549.6s)]
*  You can't even go on there and say there's only two genders. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7551.84s)]
*  If you go on there and say there's two genders, [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7553.8s)]
*  they ban you immediately. [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7555.44s)]
*  They were like eating themselves [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7556.44s)]
*  within two days over there though. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7557.5599999999995s)]
*  But that's what always happens. [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7559.08s)]
*  That's happened with Gab too, right? [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7560.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7562.36s)]
*  And I think some of that is not even real [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7563.2s)]
*  because I personally know comics who go on Blue Sky [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7564.92s)]
*  and just say insane leftist stuff, [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7568.16s)]
*  just like the most preposterous thing, [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7571.24s)]
*  like maybe Duncan would do. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7572.96s)]
*  I'm not saying Duncan does it, but he might do it. [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7574.88s)]
*  But I know comics that do that just to see the reaction, [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7577.12s)]
*  how people agree with them. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7580.04s)]
*  Like insane stuff. [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7581.96s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7582.8s)]
*  Like my toddler, I could tell when my toddler was trans [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7583.64s)]
*  when they were three days old. [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7586.44s)]
*  And people agree with them? [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7587.84s)]
*  Oh yeah, jump right in. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7588.84s)]
*  Don't you think we're all in echo chambers though, [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7590.2s)]
*  like you said? Sure. [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7592.32s)]
*  How do you stay outside of yours? [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7593.44s)]
*  Drugs. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7595.8s)]
*  Oh, that's true. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7596.96s)]
*  That's a lot. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7597.8s)]
*  No, I'm kidding. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7598.92s)]
*  You just gotta be recognized like you're thinking. [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7600.04s)]
*  You have to have a process. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7602.72s)]
*  What's your process? [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7604.32s)]
*  I live by the Joe Rogan School of Internetting. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7605.8s)]
*  How's that? [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7608.5599999999995s)]
*  I take all your advice. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7609.4s)]
*  I don't read the comments and I post in ghost. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7611.76s)]
*  That's good. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7613.12s)]
*  I don't like get in there and. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7613.96s)]
*  That's good. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7615.4400000000005s)]
*  I definitely do that. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7618.32s)]
*  And then I think of like, [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7619.32s)]
*  what do I really think about something [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7621.4800000000005s)]
*  and why do I think about it that way? [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7623.08s)]
*  And I try to go with, is it because it's self-serving? [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7625.12s)]
*  Is it because I've said it in the past [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7628.16s)]
*  that I wanna be right? [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7629.84s)]
*  Is it, what is it? [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7631.04s)]
*  You know, like what makes me believe what I believe? [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7632.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7635.2s)]
*  And then you have to do a deep dive [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7636.04s)]
*  and all the goddamn arguments back and forth [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7637.84s)]
*  to figure out who's right. [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7640.4s)]
*  And all the logic and the ill-ot [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7642.08s)]
*  and see people ignoring certain core facts. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7644.32s)]
*  Like this is the most fascinating thing [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7647.799999999999s)]
*  about this USA thing to me is how people on the left [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7650.0s)]
*  are completely ignoring all the rampant obvious corruption [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7652.28s)]
*  and conflicts of interest in the government funding [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7656.92s)]
*  non-government organizations [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7660.5199999999995s)]
*  that in turn fund the government. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7662.4s)]
*  That's so crazy. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7664.2s)]
*  And anybody that doesn't think that's crazy, [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7665.839999999999s)]
*  it's like, what do you love? [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7667.759999999999s)]
*  Money influencing everything in your daily life. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7668.88s)]
*  Don't you think that maybe we have a problem [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7671.68s)]
*  in that we have a huge deficit? [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7674.04s)]
*  And if part of our huge deficit, [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7675.68s)]
*  we're spending fucking billions of dollars [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7677.400000000001s)]
*  every year on horse shit? [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7679.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7680.4800000000005s)]
*  I mean, that is my issue with people being like, [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7681.32s)]
*  see, it is the like political thing isn't right, [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7683.64s)]
*  which is true. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7687.16s)]
*  It's important to be accurate, [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7688.0s)]
*  but it's also like, yeah, but there's, [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7689.84s)]
*  this money shouldn't be spent this way. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7692.88s)]
*  So just because this thing is maybe not true, [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7695.32s)]
*  you're pointing to this one thing [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7697.48s)]
*  that could be people are misrepresenting, [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7698.799999999999s)]
*  but there's a much bigger problem [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7700.919999999999s)]
*  you seem to wanna just sweep under the rug [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7702.759999999999s)]
*  and say, oh, like you guys are just crazy [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7705.28s)]
*  for noticing all these connections. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7708.2s)]
*  But didn't they make them stop or something? [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7710.719999999999s)]
*  Did they freeze their ability? [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7713.599999999999s)]
*  USA's frozen. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7715.16s)]
*  These kids are nuts. [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7716.599999999999s)]
*  That guy who like found the scroll, [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7717.679999999999s)]
*  how to read the scroll from Pompeii. [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7720.839999999999s)]
*  From Pompeii, yeah, using AI. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7722.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7724.44s)]
*  No, they're wizards. [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7725.28s)]
*  That's the kind of people that you want [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7726.5199999999995s)]

*  And that's why Elon got them. [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7729.04s)]
*  I mean, he knows what the fuck he's doing. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7730.32s)]
*  It's all very strange because it's, [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7732.36s)]
*  you're dealing with so many things [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7736.719999999999s)]
*  that are happening at the same time. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7738.28s)]
*  You have this technology that was never available before [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7739.5199999999995s)]
*  that is allowing people to freely express themselves [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7742.599999999999s)]
*  online, right? [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7745.799999999999s)]
*  And then you have this maniac billionaire [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7746.639999999999s)]
*  who buys the biggest one [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7748.4s)]
*  and makes it the Wild West again. [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7749.919999999999s)]
*  And then you have government being exposed for what it is. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7752.4s)]
*  So you have all these fucking NGOs, [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7755.8s)]
*  this web of, we talked about it yesterday, [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7758.28s)]
*  this web of 55,000 different NGOs [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7760.2s)]
*  that were supporting all these liberal causes [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7763.56s)]
*  that were all completely intertwined. [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7765.64s)]
*  And they had to use software to find that [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7767.360000000001s)]
*  and to figure it out. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7769.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7770.400000000001s)]
*  So they're finding out that this is like [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7771.24s)]
*  this complicated propaganda network that existed. [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7772.28s)]
*  Look, that's not good. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7775.6s)]
*  No. [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7777.08s)]
*  That's not good for anybody left or right. [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7777.92s)]
*  Because it's money. [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7780.16s)]
*  It's just money being used in a way. [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7781.08s)]

*  People saying the $10 billion, [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7786.16s)]
*  it's only $10 billion, that kind of shit. [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7787.2s)]
*  What about the fucking people in Maui? [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7789.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7791.5599999999995s)]
*  What about, that could have been fixed with $5 billion. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7792.4s)]
*  The government could have said, [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7795.04s)]
*  we are going to rebuild those people's homes [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7796.24s)]
*  to the exact state and even better [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7799.839999999999s)]
*  than where they were before. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7802.12s)]
*  It's gonna cost us $5 billion. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7803.24s)]
*  All the money that we're sending over to Ukraine, [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7805.48s)]

*  in the tune of billions and billions and billions of dollars. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7814.48s)]
*  They could have done that. [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7816.919999999999s)]
*  And instead of doing that, [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7818.48s)]
*  they're telling us that what we have to do [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7820.16s)]
*  is continue to fund all these programs [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7821.879999999999s)]

*  is bet on all this stuff. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7832.959999999999s)]
*  And it all is involved with, [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7834.28s)]
*  intertwined with these NGOs [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7836.5599999999995s)]

*  And this is the thing. [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7840.16s)]
*  We have to go and help these people. [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7841.44s)]

*  They're gonna do this, they're gonna do that. [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7843.84s)]
*  What about America? [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7845.04s)]
*  Yeah, and then you have like- [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7846.88s)]
*  What about our tax dollars going into a safety net [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7847.72s)]
*  to help people from one of the worst wildfires in history? [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7850.4800000000005s)]
*  Or North Carolina. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7853.96s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7857.72s)]
*  Apparently none of those people [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7858.56s)]
*  have gotten any money in North Carolina. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7859.400000000001s)]
*  No, and they're like sleeping in fricking tents [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7861.0s)]
*  in the freezing cold. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7863.08s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7864.12s)]
*  All that could have been addressed too. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7864.96s)]
*  The same way we address problems in other countries. [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7866.6s)]
*  So if you have this amazing slush fund [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7869.28s)]
*  that USAID is, [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7872.8s)]

*  to the problems of America, [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7876.08s)]
*  why would you think people would support it? [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7877.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7880.320000000001s)]
*  Why would we support it with our tax dollars [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7881.16s)]
*  when we know that the country's massively in debt? [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7882.68s)]
*  Well, and it's like, [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7884.96s)]
*  I appreciate that there are so many problems. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7885.88s)]
*  I think people, I do feel like for the first time ever, [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7888.280000000001s)]
*  there is an actual transfer of power. [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7892.2s)]
*  Like every single election through my lifetime, [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7895.12s)]
*  it's been, there's been all the normal fighting [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7898.68s)]
*  between the two parties. [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7901.88s)]
*  And then the election happens and one party wins, [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7903.2s)]
*  and then nothing changes. [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7906.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7908.4800000000005s)]
*  And you just keep sliding and sliding [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7909.32s)]
*  and sliding and sliding. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7911.0s)]
*  And everybody says they're gonna do something [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7912.36s)]
*  and no one does anything. [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7913.92s)]
*  And then you have fucking Elon come in like a wrecking ball [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7914.92s)]
*  and a very motivated and Trump, [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7918.400000000001s)]
*  who seems organized this time, [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7921.92s)]
*  and they actually feel like they're making changes. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7923.56s)]
*  Changes that by the way, American people want. [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7927.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, like the border. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7930.72s)]
*  They fixed the border overnight. [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7932.6s)]
*  Overnight. [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7934.4400000000005s)]

*  I mean you know how complicated it would be [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7980.32s)]
*  to try and untangle that web of where you're inflating things [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7982.2s)]
*  that people have and you're saying this is like a band. [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7986.88s)]
*  You see these things online [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7989.76s)]
*  where it's like a band aid is $25,000. [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7991.2s)]
*  You know, like what? [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7993.92s)]
*  Someone explained that to me too, [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7995.6s)]
*  is that when you have a budget, [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7997.04s)]
*  say if you run an organization and it has a budget, [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=7998.56s)]
*  you're getting money from the government [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8000.8s)]
*  and that budget's like $80 million a year, [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8001.92s)]
*  you can't spend 60, [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8003.68s)]
*  because then you're gonna get 60 next year. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8004.68s)]
*  You have to spend all 80. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8006.320000000001s)]
*  If you don't spend all 80, you don't get it. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8007.68s)]
*  You gotta say, we need 90. [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8009.4400000000005s)]

*  I mean, maybe not this, but there's provider side fraud [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8167.5s)]
*  that is very well known and people [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8170.339999999999s)]

*  There's a doctor that I was just watching [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8174.099999999999s)]
*  this whole thing on where he, [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8175.44s)]
*  I think it was 200 people he treated, [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8178.58s)]
*  it might've been more, that did not have cancer [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8181.66s)]
*  and he gave them chemotherapy. [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8184.86s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8186.58s)]
*  He falsely diagnosed them as having cancer [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8188.18s)]
*  and then treated them for cancer. [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8191.7s)]
*  Yeah, and some of them got really sick and died. [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8194.38s)]
*  Well yeah, it's chemo. [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8196.34s)]
*  Yeah, it's chemo, it's fucking killing you. [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8197.78s)]
*  And wrecks your health. [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8199.66s)]
*  So even if you survive it, [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8201.18s)]
*  like your body's wrecked for a long time afterwards. [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8202.42s)]
*  And did he do this just for money? [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8204.94s)]
*  For money, yeah. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8206.5s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8207.34s)]
*  And his argument was that this term [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8208.18s)]
*  that they always use, you eat what you kill [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8210.7s)]
*  and then you have to have a business. [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8212.98s)]
*  You have to keep your business rolling. [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8216.220000000001s)]
*  So his business was making sure [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8217.98s)]
*  that people thought they had cancer [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8219.66s)]
*  and then treating them for cancer. [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8221.380000000001s)]
*  That's dark. [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8222.7s)]
*  Well that's cancer and chemotherapy [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8223.54s)]
*  is one of those weird ones where the doctors profit [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8225.14s)]
*  off of each chemotherapy. [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8228.14s)]

*  They spin it in a centrifuge. [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8345.86s)]
*  Forget what the exact process they do. [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8347.74s)]
*  And then they pull out this liquid [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8349.820000000002s)]
*  that is the most potent anti-inflammatory inflammation drug [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8352.320000000002s)]
*  that you could ever find. [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8357.18s)]
*  So this anti-inflammation drug, [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8358.74s)]
*  it's made out of your own blood [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8361.74s)]
*  so your body doesn't reject it. [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8363.140000000001s)]
*  This process that they do. [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8364.78s)]
*  And then they inject it in the areas around the discs [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8366.18s)]
*  and the discs all settled [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8368.74s)]
*  and they went right back into place. [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8369.78s)]
*  Wow. [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8370.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8371.74s)]
*  I had it done on my lower back. [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8372.58s)]
*  I had it done on my upper back [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8373.58s)]
*  and I had it done on my neck. [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8374.74s)]
*  See, I think that this is where I'm excited [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8375.78s)]
*  about AI and stuff like that. [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8378.18s)]
*  It would be exciting to have AI cure cancer [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8379.960000000001s)]
*  which they think that it might be able to do. [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8384.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8387.94s)]
*  I saw that Larry Ellison thing. [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8389.140000000001s)]
*  Are you making money doing this? [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8390.92s)]
*  Well, obviously. [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8392.36s)]
*  I don't know if Larry, [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8393.6s)]
*  is Larry Ellison saying that? [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8394.44s)]
*  Why is he doing it? [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8395.28s)]
*  Are you a doctor? [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8396.12s)]
*  Like why are you doing that? [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8396.94s)]
*  Are you a doctor? [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8397.78s)]
*  Don't you own Lanai? [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8398.62s)]
*  What are you doing? [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8399.560000000001s)]
*  But I don't see, [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8400.400000000001s)]
*  it seems like it's not outside the realm of possibility [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8401.44s)]
*  that AI would get smart enough to figure this shit out. [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8404.44s)]
*  100%. [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8406.880000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it is possible for sure. [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8407.76s)]
*  And it's very hopeful. [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8409.84s)]
*  But I don't know if we should be telling people [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8410.960000000001s)]
*  that it could do that maybe in the future. [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8414.0s)]
*  So invest in my company or whatever the fuck's going on. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8416.36s)]
*  I was at this crazy boondoggle [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8419.28s)]
*  and I saw a bunch of these people talk [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8421.72s)]
*  and everybody was clapping. [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8424.44s)]
*  And I was like, [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8426.119999999999s)]
*  this is the scariest shit I've ever heard. [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8427.36s)]
*  And I think it might've been Sam who was talking Altman [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8429.46s)]
*  and everybody was just like, [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8432.56s)]
*  yay, let's give him money. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8433.6s)]
*  And they all just saw money. [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8435.44s)]
*  Everyone sees money here. [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8436.68s)]
*  And the gold hills, [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8438.32s)]
*  I mean, we're gonna need to build nuclear. [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8440.26s)]
*  We're gonna need to power this shit. [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8442.08s)]
*  There's a lot of gold in those hills. [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8444.86s)]
*  And I was in the back with this guy [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8447.119999999999s)]
*  and I'm like, someone needs to stop it. [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8449.119999999999s)]
*  It was fucking chills down my spine. [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8451.64s)]
*  Yeah, it's gonna happen though. [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8454.599999999999s)]
*  You can't stop it. [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8456.46s)]
*  Unless the grid goes down or something, [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8457.84s)]
*  unless there is something catastrophic, [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8461.359999999999s)]
*  asteroid hits the earth, whatever, [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8463.76s)]
*  which I think there might be one coming. [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8465.68s)]
*  There is nothing we can do. [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8468.76s)]
*  The genie's out of the bottle. [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8472.08s)]
*  Well, not just that, we have to do it [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8473.4s)]
*  because there's other people that are doing it. [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8475.08s)]
*  And if they get ahold of it first, it's over. [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8476.68s)]
*  That's the race to the bottom though. [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8481.04s)]
*  Is it? [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8482.92s)]
*  I don't know. My friend lived. [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8483.76s)]
*  I mean, if we all have it, [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8484.58s)]
*  and it just eventually works for humanity [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8485.42s)]
*  instead of against us. [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8488.52s)]
*  I do think that, my husband thinks [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8490.04s)]
*  that our daughter will never need to learn how to drive. [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8492.720000000001s)]
*  Probably. [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8496.32s)]
*  He's like, she's not gonna need, [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8497.24s)]
*  cause I was like, she wants to drive already. [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8498.56s)]
*  She's like, when I'm five, I can drive. [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8500.880000000001s)]
*  I'm like, no. [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8502.960000000001s)]
*  She is, having kids is the best. [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8504.320000000002s)]
*  I hate that there was so much rhetoric [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8507.76s)]
*  that I was growing up with about how horrible it is, [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8510.68s)]
*  because it is, yeah. [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8513.6s)]
*  It's all by people who don't have kids. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8515.640000000001s)]
*  But it's so, the other morning, [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8517.2s)]
*  I go downstairs and she's like, [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8519.480000000001s)]
*  I'm like, how you doing? [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8521.640000000001s)]
*  She's eating her breakfast. [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8522.480000000001s)]
*  She's like, I just need to lay low. [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8523.640000000001s)]
*  I was like, are we hiding from the mob? [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8526.480000000001s)]
*  What is happening? [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8530.76s)]
*  They're experimenting with news ways to talk. [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8532.839999999998s)]
*  They're just so funny. [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8534.64s)]
*  She's like, and she just says the funniest stuff. [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8535.839999999998s)]
*  She did a whole, my husband sent me a whole thing. [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8538.519999999999s)]
*  She picks up everything, they pick up everything. [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8541.119999999999s)]
*  She was like, I'm going to mothership, [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8544.039999999999s)]
*  and you're gonna go to New York. [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8545.98s)]
*  I'm like, where'd she get the New York accent from? [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8547.64s)]
*  I'm going to mothership, and you're going to New York [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8550.08s)]
*  to tell jokes. [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8552.32s)]
*  She's telling them all about this. [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8554.259999999998s)]
*  I'm like, how does she pick all this, [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8555.64s)]
*  it's the best thing in the whole world, [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8558.46s)]
*  but yeah, he doesn't think, she wants to drive, [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8560.32s)]
*  and he's like, she's not gonna need to know how to drive. [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8562.84s)]
*  Well, she probably will learn how to drive, [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8564.96s)]
*  but it won't be necessary. [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8567.98s)]
*  I think they're gonna make the argument [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8570.26s)]
*  that autonomous driving is way safer. [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8574.06s)]
*  But I think it probably is. [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8576.56s)]
*  Oh, it is. [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8578.199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8579.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I have auto drive on my Tesla. [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8579.88s)]
*  But they all have to be autonomous. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8581.72s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8582.56s)]
*  No one's gonna be allowed to drive. [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8584.16s)]
*  That's probably what's gonna happen. [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8586.16s)]
*  That's the only way. [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8587.119999999999s)]
*  They're all gonna be communicating with each other, [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8587.96s)]
*  and it's like. [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8591.02s)]
*  There'll probably be roads that are set up [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8591.86s)]
*  where you can allow people to drive. [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8592.7s)]
*  How do you feel about that? [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8594.78s)]
*  I don't know, I like cars. [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8595.82s)]
*  Yeah, I do too. [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8597.58s)]
*  So it's not good, I like old cars too. [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8598.42s)]
*  I like driving. [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8600.02s)]
*  Yeah, I do. [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8600.86s)]
*  It helps my brain unfurl. [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8601.7s)]
*  Well, I like machines. [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8604.56s)]
*  I'm into old machines, I like the way they work. [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8606.66s)]
*  Do you know how to fix cars? [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8609.300000000001s)]
*  I know how to fix some things, but not really. [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8611.02s)]
*  I mean, I know how to change spark plugs, [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8613.42s)]
*  and change oil, and I understand. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8615.1s)]
*  Like basics? [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8617.460000000001s)]
*  Yeah, normal stuff. [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8618.300000000001s)]
*  Most cars don't even have spark plugs anymore. [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8619.68s)]
*  No, it's weird. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8621.480000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's all wild. [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8622.36s)]
*  You open up the back of a Porsche, [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8624.480000000001s)]
*  like look at the engine, you're like, [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8628.960000000001s)]
*  what the fuck is that? [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8630.08s)]
*  And Teslas only have one gear? [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8630.92s)]
*  I don't understand how that even. [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8634.460000000001s)]
*  Have you ever been in one? [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8635.300000000001s)]
*  No. [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8637.240000000002s)]
*  Oh, dude, I didn't bring mine today. [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8638.08s)]
*  Oh wait, no, I have been in one. [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8638.92s)]
*  Next time I have mine, you gotta go for a ride. [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8639.820000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8642.880000000001s)]
*  Mine's insane. [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8643.720000000001s)]
*  The new one. [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8644.54s)]
*  Yeah, it goes zero to 60 in 1.9 seconds. [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8645.380000000001s)]
*  That's nuts. [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8647.28s)]
*  It's a time issue. [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8648.12s)]
*  How do you do that? [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8649.78s)]
*  Because it has 1,000 horsepower, and four wheel drive, [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8650.62s)]
*  and incredible electrical engines [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8653.220000000001s)]
*  that just instantly generate torque and power. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8655.060000000001s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8657.220000000001s)]
*  It just goes, it just takes off. [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8658.060000000001s)]
*  They're amazing. [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8660.1s)]
*  And it also self drives. [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8661.140000000001s)]
*  It doesn't just self drive, it changes lanes, [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8662.68s)]
*  it stops for stop signs, it stops for red lights, [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8664.82s)]
*  it turns, it's incredible. [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8668.34s)]
*  It changes lanes when there's obstructions in front of it. [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8671.1s)]
*  Can you take your eyes off the, [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8673.32s)]
*  can you like text and stuff? [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8675.140000000001s)]
*  Can you be a passenger? [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8676.62s)]
*  I don't. [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8677.460000000001s)]
*  I could, I guess. [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8678.28s)]
*  People have fallen asleep at the wheel, famously. [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8679.12s)]
*  But don't they give you like strikes or something like that? [[02:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8681.320000000002s)]
*  Like Tesla itself will. [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8683.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah, supposedly if you're not looking. [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8685.68s)]
*  That's kinda creepy. [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8687.52s)]
*  Yeah, it's creepy. [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8688.6s)]
*  Yeah, it's all creepy. [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8689.800000000001s)]
*  But if you wanna do it right, that's how you have to do it. [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8690.92s)]
*  You can't just let people take naps [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8692.6s)]
*  and just press play. [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8694.880000000001s)]
*  But isn't that the point? [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8696.76s)]
*  I wanna be in my car typing. [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8697.880000000001s)]
*  Well eventually you'll be able to do that. [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8699.44s)]
*  Eventually you won't even have a steering wheel. [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8701.2s)]
*  Eventually there'll be a pod that you get in, [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8702.800000000001s)]
*  and it takes you places. [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8704.480000000001s)]
*  This reminds me of that Silicon Valley episode [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8705.320000000002s)]
*  where the self-driving car drives right into [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8707.4s)]
*  one of the shipping containers, [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8710.32s)]
*  and then he's just stuck in a shipping container. [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8711.8s)]
*  I didn't see that. [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8714.0s)]
*  Oh, it's so good. [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8714.84s)]
*  I've never watched that show. [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8715.66s)]
*  That show is brilliant. [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8716.5s)]
*  Yeah, it's weird. [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8717.4s)]
*  But again, if you go back to the people [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8719.48s)]
*  that were on trains and riding horses, [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8721.76s)]
*  and you say one day you're gonna be able to get in a car [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8724.24s)]
*  that goes 1.9 seconds, zero to 60, [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8726.6s)]
*  and it's gonna be electric and make no sound. [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8728.859999999999s)]
*  You'd be like, what? [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8731.199999999999s)]
*  Well one day you're not gonna need to steer, [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8732.56s)]
*  because steering is why people get fucked up, [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8734.720000000001s)]
*  because the cars can't detect other cars around them. [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8737.56s)]
*  They change lanes, people make mistakes, [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8739.880000000001s)]
*  they go forward when they shouldn't, [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8741.68s)]
*  they run red lights, all that's gonna end. [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8743.1s)]
*  So I'm like a half hour out of the city, [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8745.76s)]
*  and every time I drive to and from, [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8748.2s)]
*  almost every time there's an accident, I always see. [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8753.28s)]
*  The other night I was driving home, [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8756.720000000001s)]
*  actually from mothership, it was like 1.30 in the morning, [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8757.84s)]
*  and there was a guy on the left side of the freeway walking. [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8760.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8765.32s)]
*  There's no space by the way. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8767.720000000001s)]
*  I was like, what is happening right now? [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8769.52s)]
*  People are texting, they're not paying attention. [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8771.36s)]
*  No, there are trucks behind me. [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8773.4s)]
*  It was nuts, I was like, this guy is either [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8776.52s)]
*  on drugs and crazy, or it's some Jason Bourne situation [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8779.16s)]
*  where he was limping. [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8783.48s)]
*  He probably broke down and had to walk him. [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8786.12s)]
*  No, he looked crazy. [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8788.28s)]
*  Crazy person, decided to flirt with death. [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8790.560000000001s)]
*  Texas is a little, it feels a little unhinged. [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8794.36s)]
*  Does it, compared to LA? [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8797.6s)]
*  When was the last time you were back in LA? [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8799.0s)]
*  No, I was just there, I was there two days before the fires. [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8800.84s)]
*  People are unhinged. [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8802.880000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8804.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8805.240000000002s)]
*  No, I mean it feels a little wild, [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8806.08s)]
*  like I like it. [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8807.68s)]
*  It's not gonna get any better. [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8808.52s)]
*  I like the, I like the, it makes, [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8809.36s)]
*  I'm coming up on two years here. [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8812.320000000002s)]
*  So what do you mean by wild? [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8815.560000000001s)]
*  It feels wild to me, it still feels very like [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8817.240000000002s)]
*  the wild west or like Texas. [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8820.52s)]
*  There's just an energy here of kind of, [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8822.6s)]
*  every time I'm down on Sixth Street I'm like, [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8824.92s)]
*  I'm gonna catch a stray down here. [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8826.44s)]
*  Well, Sixth Street is wild. [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8828.640000000001s)]
*  Where the club is, that's a wild place. [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8830.720000000001s)]
*  There's fucking bonkers down there. [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8832.640000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but that's also what makes the club exciting. [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8834.480000000001s)]
*  You might catch a stray while you're waiting. [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8837.560000000001s)]
*  No, not that, but all the people, the foot traffic. [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8839.320000000002s)]
*  You know, there's an energy on that street. [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8843.240000000002s)]
*  Yeah, no, I like it. [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8846.08s)]
*  And I like the kind of, when I, [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8847.92s)]
*  even coming from LA, driving in Texas, [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8849.76s)]
*  I was like, these people are out of their fucking minds, [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8853.28s)]
*  because it's so much bigger, and every, [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8856.52s)]
*  it's like 80 miles an hour speed limits everywhere [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8858.8s)]
*  out where I am. [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8862.039999999999s)]
*  So everyone's actually doing 90. [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8863.44s)]
*  And I would be driving and I'm like, [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8865.72s)]
*  they're like, get out of the way, grandma's. [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8867.64s)]
*  And I'm like, I'm doing fucking 85. [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8869.64s)]
*  Like it's not, like I'm going slow. [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8871.6s)]
*  Are you in the left lane? [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8873.4s)]
*  No. No. [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8874.48s)]
*  I'd be in the middle lane. [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8875.560000000001s)]
*  And they're still trying to get you out of the way? [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8877.0s)]
*  Yeah, I was his grandma. [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8878.84s)]
*  I had to out my game. [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8880.2s)]
*  Well, didn't you see that in LA too? [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8882.560000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but it wasn't, it was always like street racing kids, [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8885.52s)]
*  like maybe out further. [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8889.48s)]
*  How often could you get your car [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8892.880000000001s)]
*  to 80 miles an hour driving around LA? [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8894.84s)]
*  At nighttime. [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8897.32s)]
*  I mean at night. [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8898.16s)]
*  Yeah, I'd see a lot of people driving super fast [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8899.0s)]
*  at night in LA. Yeah, yeah. [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8901.76s)]
*  More unhinged people, I think. [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8902.720000000001s)]
*  Really? [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8904.32s)]
*  Because I would see people driving recklessly on the 101. [[02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8905.72s)]
*  Like when I was coming home from the store sometimes, [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8908.56s)]
*  I'd be like, what the fuck? [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8910.44s)]

*  Well, when people live a half an hour away from the city [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8917.08s)]
*  and they want to get home quick, that's how you do it. [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8918.88s)]

*  It's, I don't know, I'm glad I moved here. [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8926.84s)]
*  I remember you saying like it feels, [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8929.24s)]
*  my husband's blood pressure actually went down. [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8931.28s)]
*  When he moved here. [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8935.84s)]
*  Yeah, there's less people. [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8937.92s)]
*  But it's also just like everything is less of a battle. [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8938.76s)]
*  You said it to me, I think, like you felt like [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8941.6s)]
*  you could exhale on one of our, like when you were talking, [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8943.48s)]

*  I can like breathe a little. [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8948.16s)]
*  And I mean, my husband has like scientific evidence [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8950.32s)]
*  that he, his whole like energy field got more chill. [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8954.48s)]
*  Yeah, you're not supposed to be living in a place [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8960.4s)]
*  that has 20 million people. [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8961.92s)]
*  I think it's bad for you. [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8963.12s)]
*  You want to Cairo? [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8964.880000000001s)]
*  No. [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8965.720000000001s)]

*  I wanna go. [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8970.960000000001s)]
*  When you went to the pyramids, when was it? [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8971.800000000001s)]
*  How long ago? [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8973.480000000001s)]
*  Oh my gosh, it was crazy. [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8974.32s)]
*  It was right after the revolution. [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8975.720000000001s)]
*  So we went in 20, it was 20, it was 2000. [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8977.6s)]
*  When was the Arab Spring? [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8985.480000000001s)]
*  That was internet times. [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8988.6s)]

*  2010, Arab Spring? [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8997.68s)]
*  So it must have been 2011. [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=8999.28s)]
*  That was one of the first revolutions [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9001.880000000001s)]
*  that the internet was credited with starting. [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9003.44s)]
*  Yeah, and no one was there. [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9005.960000000001s)]
*  So everyone was like, why the fuck are you guys in Egypt? [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9008.68s)]
*  We got basically a private tour of the whole country. [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9011.720000000001s)]
*  Like there was like, we were on a cruise on the Nile [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9015.240000000002s)]
*  and it was supposed to be, you know, hundreds of people. [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9017.960000000001s)]
*  There were 14 people on the cruise. [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9020.6s)]
*  And we got to see, there's usually lines [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9023.160000000002s)]
*  to go into the great pyramids. [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9025.6s)]
*  There were no lines, no lines to see King Tut. [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9027.36s)]
*  There was, no one was anywhere. [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9031.12s)]
*  It was a weird time to be in Egypt. [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9033.68s)]
*  And we saw, I went to Alexandria, I was in Cairo, [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9037.2s)]
*  went and did like a Nile cruise, which was amazing. [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9041.76s)]
*  I mean, Egypt, you gotta go. [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9045.28s)]
*  Yeah, I definitely do. [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9047.84s)]
*  Did you get this weird feeling, [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9049.2s)]
*  like how did this go away? [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9051.08s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I don't understand. [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9053.4s)]
*  And I think I had like a mental breakdown when I was there. [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9056.56s)]
*  Like a weird, I was, we were in the hospital, [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9062.16s)]
*  not the hospital I wanted, [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9066.0s)]
*  I felt like I should get checked into a hospital. [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9067.0s)]
*  We were staying in like the Nile across from all the tombs, [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9069.48s)]
*  the like King's tombs. [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9075.56s)]
*  And I kept feeling this like pulse. [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9078.12s)]
*  And I had like a panic attack when I was there, basically. [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9080.28s)]
*  It was the weirdest thing though. [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9083.720000000001s)]
*  I kept feeling this pulse, it was like, womp, womp. [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9085.240000000002s)]
*  Was this when you were doing drugs? [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9088.08s)]
*  No, no. [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9089.240000000002s)]
*  I mean, I was drinking still, but I wasn't doing drugs. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9091.400000000001s)]
*  And I was like, I'm gonna have a, [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9095.84s)]
*  I felt, I thought I was gonna end up in a straight jacket. [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9097.960000000001s)]
*  And I thought I had like a panic attack. [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9100.400000000001s)]
*  I had like these crazy dreams. [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9102.6s)]
*  And I was like, oh, this is where it all started [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9104.880000000001s)]
*  for like my whatever. [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9108.4s)]
*  It was fucking, it's weird. [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9110.199999999999s)]
*  It's a weird energy. [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9111.88s)]
*  Do you think you were getting this feeling, [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9113.24s)]
*  like you said, like here, it's in the soil. [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9115.24s)]
*  There's something in the soil here, [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9118.32s)]
*  like this fierce independence [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9119.68s)]
*  because these people are tough and they survived [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9121.72s)]
*  making it across the Great Plains and all that shit. [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9123.96s)]
*  Do you think you felt that there, [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9126.88s)]
*  like this is the feeling of this civilization [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9128.48s)]
*  that used to exist in this place? [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9131.72s)]
*  Yeah, it felt to me, [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9133.48s)]
*  I feel like I had like a past life regression, [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9135.64s)]
*  if that's even a thing. [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9138.96s)]
*  It was like, I felt like whatever journey [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9140.359999999999s)]
*  I've been on on this planet, it started there. [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9144.4s)]
*  And I went back to the source and it was like a weird, [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9148.16s)]
*  like my dreams were crazy. [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9152.56s)]
*  It was, I couldn't, thank God the guy I was with [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9154.16s)]
*  was like nice and kind, but I couldn't, [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9157.88s)]
*  it was like a full blown panic attack. [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9161.599999999999s)]
*  I couldn't even leave the hotel room. [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9163.8s)]
*  And- [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9165.96s)]
*  And do you think that's just because of being in Egypt? [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9166.8s)]
*  It was just being in Egypt. [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9168.84s)]
*  Do you think it's because of the like, [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9170.64s)]
*  you knew what the civilization was like [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9172.32s)]
*  and it had declined and gone and now you're there [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9175.599999999999s)]
*  and you're just like psychologically dealing with this [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9178.24s)]
*  and you're kind of freaking out and putting it on yourself? [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9181.0s)]
*  So they had, they had, [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9183.8s)]
*  I have always been obsessed with Egypt [[02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9187.48s)]
*  since I was a little kid. [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9189.279999999999s)]
*  Just unnaturally obsessed with it. [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9190.6s)]
*  It was like, I read every book about it when I was a kid. [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9193.439999999999s)]
*  I wanted to go there. [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9196.359999999999s)]
*  I don't know why. [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9197.519999999999s)]
*  And I felt like, you know, I like to believe in past lives [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9199.039999999999s)]
*  because I think it's amusing. [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9202.72s)]
*  I'm like, if I can choose, it sounds like a fun, [[02:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9204.039999999999s)]
*  it's like, why not? [[02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9206.519999999999s)]
*  And I've always felt very connected to it. [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9207.88s)]
*  And so when I went there and was across from, [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9210.48s)]
*  we were in the King Farooq suite actually, [[02:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9213.32s)]
*  and it had a balcony that overlooked the Nile and the tombs. [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9216.400000000001s)]
*  And it was, I could feel, it was like something in my heart, [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9220.720000000001s)]
*  like a vibration. [[02:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9224.04s)]
*  And they've said that these places like, [[02:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9224.880000000001s)]
*  where there are these pyramids, they can have vibrations. [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9226.800000000001s)]
*  I learned this later, but this was like a weird, [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9230.04s)]
*  like it kept hitting my heart. [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9232.640000000001s)]
*  And then I thought they drugged me. [[02:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9235.12s)]
*  I thought they gave me something in my hibiscus tea [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9236.800000000001s)]
*  because I started like, I immediately, [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9239.400000000001s)]
*  I drank the hibiscus tea and I was like, [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9244.52s)]
*  maybe they put some kind of like hallucinogen in it. [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9246.12s)]
*  But I think I just, I like, I think about this a lot [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9248.68s)]
*  because I've had friends who have had anxiety [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9252.0s)]
*  and panic attacks and I know what it's like [[02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9253.800000000001s)]
*  to like get in your head and feel like [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9255.560000000001s)]
*  you're losing your mind. [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9257.560000000001s)]
*  And I had to baby step my way out of this like panic attack [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9258.640000000001s)]
*  where I couldn't eat, I was unable to keep food down. [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9264.26s)]
*  I just took a bath and was like, I'm gonna just chew. [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9267.240000000002s)]
*  And that's never happened to you before? [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9270.560000000001s)]
*  No, I had had like, I've had anxiety. [[02:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9271.640000000001s)]
*  I feel for people who have anxiety. [[02:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9273.76s)]
*  I had had anxiety before, but it was when I was doing, [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9275.44s)]
*  I was smoking a lot of weed and doing a lot of drugs [[02:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9280.36s)]
*  and I was in a marriage I didn't wanna be in [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9283.560000000001s)]
*  to my first husband. [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9285.32s)]
*  So your life was a mess. [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9286.16s)]
*  And I just was lying to myself. [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9287.52s)]
*  Like I think depression and anxiety can be very useful [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9289.68s)]
*  signposts for something in your life. [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9294.0s)]
*  You're either doing something you shouldn't be doing [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9296.34s)]
*  or you're not doing something you should be doing. [[02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9298.34s)]
*  You got a course correct. [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9299.960000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9300.800000000001s)]
*  It's giving you motivation. [[02:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9301.640000000001s)]
*  Or it's saying like, there's something, [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9302.460000000001s)]
*  it's like a soul calling for you to check in. [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9304.76s)]
*  So yoga kind of saved me from that time I got divorced. [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9308.12s)]
*  It somewhat went away. [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9313.2s)]
*  I've talked about my hypochondria. [[02:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9314.800000000001s)]
*  So that I dealt with that, but then I was, [[02:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9316.68s)]
*  this was different. [[02:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9319.08s)]
*  It was like a weird, [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9320.28s)]
*  my body physiologically reacted to it too. [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9321.960000000001s)]
*  So I like not to be too much information, [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9325.08s)]
*  but I like randomly got a period out of nowhere. [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9328.0s)]
*  It was just weird. [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9330.22s)]
*  My body started, like I threw up, [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9331.06s)]
*  I got a period all at once. [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9333.22s)]
*  And it was such a, it's like, [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9335.42s)]
*  it's the most supernatural thing that's ever happened to me. [[02:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9338.099999999999s)]
*  Well, there was another time that was really supernatural [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9340.98s)]
*  when I was in Newport, Rhode Island. [[02:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9343.699999999999s)]
*  And I swear there was like a haunting. [[02:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9345.359999999999s)]
*  But other than that, this was, it felt supernatural. [[02:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9347.3s)]
*  Like it didn't feel normal. [[02:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9351.38s)]
*  And it took me two full days to like, [[02:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9352.939999999999s)]
*  whatever hit me in my heart on that balcony. [[02:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9356.26s)]
*  And I couldn't like, all I could hear was this like, [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9360.099999999999s)]
*  and it was reverberating from the, [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9363.42s)]
*  I sound like a crazy person, [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9366.58s)]
*  but it was reverberating from the tombs. [[02:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9367.900000000001s)]
*  And then I would just, [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9370.54s)]
*  I remember eating a grape so slowly and mindfully [[02:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9372.26s)]
*  just to like come back into my body. [[02:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9375.740000000002s)]
*  And I had these like crazy dreams. [[02:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9378.42s)]
*  And I felt like I saw all these connections [[02:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9380.060000000001s)]
*  like people in my life present. [[02:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9382.1s)]
*  And it was really, it was weird. [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9383.86s)]
*  It was in that moment when I like had a physical reaction [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9386.44s)]
*  where it was like a scene from a movie. [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9389.86s)]
*  Where it was like zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9391.9s)]
*  like all these people in my life. [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9393.34s)]
*  And the guy was with, thank God, [[02:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9395.42s)]
*  he could have been a total asshole and been like, [[02:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9398.699999999999s)]
*  you're a fucking psycho, I'm leaving you. [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9400.5s)]
*  But he had had a weird experience with me [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9402.38s)]
*  in his guest house in New Zealand [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9404.859999999999s)]
*  where I would fall asleep sometimes downstairs [[02:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9409.06s)]
*  when, or we'd pass out or whatever. [[02:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9412.859999999999s)]
*  And I was like, did you have a dog? [[02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9414.859999999999s)]
*  Cause I was like convinced there was a ghost [[02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9416.859999999999s)]
*  cause I kept feeling some weird sense. [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9419.539999999999s)]
*  And he's like, don't talk about the dog. [[02:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9421.18s)]
*  And then it turns out there was like a dog. [[02:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9422.7s)]
*  And his kids, like he had it [[02:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9425.460000000001s)]
*  and then wanted to get rid of it. [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9427.34s)]
*  And it's something, this sore thing. [[02:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9428.54s)]
*  He's like, how the fuck did you know it was a dog? [[02:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9429.94s)]
*  And I was like, oh, cause the energy was like a puppy energy. [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9431.66s)]
*  And I was like, what happened to the dog? [[02:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9434.220000000001s)]
*  He's like, nothing, don't ever talk about the dog. [[02:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9435.74s)]
*  And I was like, okay. [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9437.86s)]
*  So he's like, you're weird and psychic [[02:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9438.9s)]
*  and like a weird sick, you have like a weird thing. [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9440.86s)]
*  He was like, you're touched by something. [[02:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9443.78s)]
*  And we used to play backgammon all the time. [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9446.460000000001s)]
*  And one time I like rolled a dice [[02:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9448.14s)]
*  and I'm sure it was just lint, [[02:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9450.46s)]
*  but it like, I wanted to win so badly. [[02:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9451.619999999999s)]
*  And then the dice just was on his corner, just frozen. [[02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9453.9s)]
*  So he had a weird like just on the tip of it. [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9457.099999999999s)]
*  Just like, he's like, what the fuck, you're a witch. [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9460.3s)]
*  So he had had slightly unsettling things with me [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9463.859999999999s)]
*  enough that I think he was like, all right, [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9468.98s)]
*  maybe she's not totally. [[02:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9470.539999999999s)]
*  Well, they say that places have memory, right? [[02:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9472.5s)]
*  This place, I mean, Egypt is so special. [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9475.26s)]
*  I haven't been obviously, [[02:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9476.939999999999s)]
*  but I felt weird when I went to Chichen Itza. [[02:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9478.34s)]
*  That feels very weird. [[02:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9481.54s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9482.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9483.86s)]
*  I was like baby stepping. [[02:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9486.22s)]
*  I still get slightly like, [[02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9487.98s)]
*  and my life has never been the same really since. [[02:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9490.62s)]
*  Like it was, and Egypt is, Cairo's bonkers, [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9493.34s)]
*  but Egypt is the Nile. [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9500.1s)]
*  I remember just like cruising down the Nile [[02:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9502.02s)]
*  and being on the deck and you can feel [[02:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9505.26s)]
*  what it was like. [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9509.06s)]
*  You're just like, this is what. [[02:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9510.019999999999s)]
*  The memory. [[02:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9511.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9512.34s)]
*  And the tombs are all very, it's very, [[02:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9513.3s)]
*  I don't know, it was very spiritual for me. [[02:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9518.019999999999s)]
*  It was like a very, [[02:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9519.779999999999s)]
*  I felt like a pilgrimage that I didn't know I was taking. [[02:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9522.019999999999s)]
*  That's how it felt to me. [[02:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9525.46s)]
*  Look, it makes sense. [[02:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9526.82s)]
*  It was the most sophisticated civilization maybe ever [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9527.66s)]
*  in terms of their building methods and construction. [[02:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9530.46s)]
*  You have to go. [[02:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9532.26s)]
*  I feel like you would love it. [[02:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9533.099999999999s)]
*  I know I would love it. [[02:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9533.939999999999s)]
*  I know I just don't have the time. [[02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9534.76s)]
*  I almost did it with Mr. Beast. [[02:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9535.94s)]
*  He went in December. [[02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9537.42s)]
*  I was gonna try to do it and do it with him. [[02:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9538.460000000001s)]
*  He wanted to do a podcast there, [[02:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9540.66s)]
*  but I just couldn't make it happen. [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9541.960000000001s)]
*  I had too busy. [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9543.300000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and it's a hike. [[02:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9544.5s)]
*  Yeah, I need to take like a good solid couple weeks [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9547.18s)]
*  and go there. [[02:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9550.42s)]
*  It needs to be something that I know [[02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9551.26s)]
*  that I'm gonna be there for a couple weeks. [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9552.4s)]
*  Right now that's not really possible. [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9553.94s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9555.460000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9556.62s)]
*  I went to visit the site of the Illicinian Mysteries [[02:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9557.460000000001s)]
*  and I was with Brian Mirorescu. [[02:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9561.86s)]
*  Where's that? [[02:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9563.9s)]
*  It's in Greece. [[02:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9564.86s)]
*  Oh. [[02:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9566.300000000001s)]
*  That was wild. [[02:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9567.7s)]
*  Really? [[02:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9568.820000000002s)]
*  That was wild. [[02:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9569.66s)]
*  That place has a memory for sure. [[02:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9570.5s)]
*  Yeah, just like touching the walls. [[02:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9572.26s)]
*  Like it just feels weird. [[02:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9574.300000000001s)]
*  You just feel like this is different. [[02:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9576.18s)]
*  Like you're in the presence of something very strange. [[02:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9577.78s)]
*  That was Egypt. [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9580.1s)]
*  Whatever the energy, [[02:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9581.140000000001s)]
*  I bet Egypt was probably even more incredible, [[02:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9582.300000000001s)]
*  but whatever the energy of that place was, [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9583.960000000001s)]
*  there's some of it left there. [[02:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9587.900000000001s)]
*  There's some weird intangible feeling that's left there [[02:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9589.74s)]
*  that just makes you feel very, very strange. [[02:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9592.62s)]
*  When I was in LA at the Getty Villa, [[02:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9595.26s)]
*  I always go there and they had the Thrace exhibit. [[02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9598.300000000001s)]
*  What's that? [[02:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9602.54s)]
*  Thrace is like a, I didn't know anything about it. [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9603.380000000001s)]
*  It's a civilization that was like partially in Bulgaria. [[02:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9605.86s)]
*  I think it came after ancient Greece. [[02:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9610.58s)]
*  There it is. [[02:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9613.86s)]
*  Treasures from Bulgaria, Romania, and Greece. [[02:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9615.02s)]
*  This statue is fucking insane. [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9616.660000000002s)]
*  It looks like it's looking at you. [[02:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9619.26s)]
*  Look at the eyes. [[02:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9621.300000000001s)]
*  It is insane to see it in real life. [[02:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9622.66s)]
*  This exhibit that's there right now [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9625.38s)]
*  is truly one of the most special exhibits I've ever seen. [[02:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9627.3s)]
*  I go to all of them that I can there. [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9631.099999999999s)]
*  Wow, look at that face. [[02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9635.18s)]
*  That's amazing. [[02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9636.98s)]
*  It's crazy. [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9637.82s)]
*  I knew nothing about this civilization and society. [[02:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9639.98s)]
*  The more I learn about it, the more obsessed I am. [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9643.58s)]
*  All of this stuff had its own, [[02:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9646.779999999999s)]
*  like when the fires were around the villa, [[02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9649.779999999999s)]
*  I was like, oh God, I hope that all this stuff is okay. [[02:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9651.94s)]
*  Those walls are fireproof and they've got... [[02:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9657.140000000001s)]
*  I'd never heard of this before. [[02:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9660.140000000001s)]
*  I'd never even really heard of Thrace. [[02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9661.86s)]
*  I've always been very obsessed with Greek mythology, [[02:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9664.34s)]
*  Roman history, all of these things, [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9667.1s)]
*  but Thrace is this crazy civilization. [[02:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9669.62s)]
*  Look at the relief with two Thraceans. [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9672.820000000002s)]
*  I wanna see if I have the... [[02:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9674.900000000001s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9677.980000000001s)]
*  Yeah, if you're back in LA, [[02:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9679.300000000001s)]
*  I think that exhibit is there until March, March 3rd, [[02:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9681.02s)]
*  I believe. [[02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9685.06s)]
*  Maybe it says temporarily closed on top. [[02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9685.9s)]
*  I don't know if it's because of the fires. [[02:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9687.74s)]
*  Probably. [[02:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9688.82s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9691.14s)]
*  Yeah, I think the Getty's temporarily closed. [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9691.98s)]
*  The Getty's now open. [[02:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9693.3s)]
*  The Getty Villa will remain closed until further notice. [[02:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9694.42s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[02:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9696.66s)]
*  I thought they reopened for some reason, [[02:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9697.939999999999s)]
*  but yeah, they must still be closed from the fires. [[02:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9699.82s)]
*  Some day someone's gonna be doing that [[02:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9702.859999999999s)]
*  with the World Trade Center. [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9704.46s)]
*  They're gonna be wandering around now. [[02:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9706.06s)]
*  This is where they used to live. [[02:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9707.22s)]
*  They used to go to school here. [[02:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9709.06s)]
*  They used to work in these buildings. [[02:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9711.5s)]
*  That's gonna happen. [[02:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9712.94s)]
*  You think? [[02:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9714.22s)]
*  Yeah, the same way we go through the Acropolis [[02:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9715.06s)]
*  in the Parthenon and wander around [[02:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9717.74s)]
*  and imagine what it was like living back then. [[02:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9719.82s)]
*  People are gonna do that with us. [[02:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9721.98s)]
*  Every civilization. [[02:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9723.9s)]
*  It's always so cool. [[02:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9724.74s)]
*  Every civilization collapses. [[02:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9725.58s)]
*  We're just trying to hold this one off as much as we can. [[02:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9727.58s)]
*  And they usually last a couple hundred years, [[02:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9731.9s)]
*  which is ours. [[02:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9733.58s)]
*  Yeah, we're pretty young. [[02:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9734.42s)]
*  I mean... [[02:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9736.42s)]
*  Yeah, but a lot of them haven't made it past [[02:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9737.26s)]
*  where we got to. [[02:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9739.58s)]
*  It always reminds me of that porno for Pyro song. [[02:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9740.78s)]
*  Which one? The Pets. [[02:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9743.86s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah. [[02:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9745.26s)]
*  It's like, [[02:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9746.1s)]
*  My friends says we're like the dinosaurs [[02:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9746.92s)]
*  and here we are doing ourselves in [[02:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9749.06s)]
*  much faster than they ever did. [[02:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9752.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9754.94s)]
*  I don't know if that's real. [[02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9756.14s)]
*  The dinosaurs? [[02:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9757.94s)]
*  No, the other thing, [[02:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9758.78s)]
*  we're doing ourselves in faster than them. [[02:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9760.06s)]
*  No, they get hit by a rock. [[02:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9761.86s)]
*  We might too. I was like, oh no. [[02:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9763.3s)]
*  We're coming to dangerous territory [[02:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9764.539999999999s)]
*  where we find out Joe doesn't believe in dinosaurs. [[02:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9766.26s)]
*  We were talking about Candace Owens last night. [[02:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9769.34s)]
*  Candace Owens like said, dinosaurs are fake and gay. [[02:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9771.66s)]
*  Is that what she says? [[02:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9774.220000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9778.86s)]
*  I don't know what she means by that. [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9779.94s)]
*  She might just be having fun. [[02:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9781.54s)]
*  This whole Bridget McCrone thing though is crazy. [[02:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9784.18s)]
*  Did you watch any of it? [[02:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9786.54s)]
*  No. [[02:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9787.62s)]
*  No, I got no time. [[02:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9790.460000000001s)]
*  But I did see a comparison to the photographs [[02:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9791.62s)]
*  of the person that she's claiming is actually, [[02:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9795.94s)]
*  you know like the brother. [[02:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9800.300000000001s)]
*  Oh, the brother. [[02:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9801.380000000001s)]
*  Didn't the brother disappear or something? [[02:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9802.220000000001s)]
*  Yeah, the brother disappeared. [[02:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9803.54s)]
*  And the brother literally looks exactly like her. [[02:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9805.1s)]
*  I mean, to a fucking T. [[02:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9808.82s)]
*  She was kind of on the Blake and Ryan thing too, I think. [[02:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9810.980000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9815.02s)]
*  She's a sleuthin. [[02:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9815.86s)]
*  She's been a sleuthin. [[02:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9817.060000000001s)]
*  Look at these. [[02:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9818.26s)]
*  Okay, that's pretty freaking weird. [[02:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9819.66s)]
*  I'll send it to Jamie. [[02:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9821.66s)]
*  Because this is, I mean, she's just going all in. [[02:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9823.66s)]
*  First of all, I don't even know if this is a real picture. [[02:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9826.779999999999s)]
*  I mean, this easily could be some AI bullshit [[02:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9828.98s)]
*  that somebody created to try to pretend [[02:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9831.5s)]
*  that the brother is actually her. [[02:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9833.42s)]
*  But the brother is like not to be found. [[02:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9835.9s)]
*  And if that's real, see, I don't know if that's real. [[02:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9839.619999999999s)]
*  I don't know if that's real [[02:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9844.98s)]
*  because I mean, even the fucking teeth are the same. [[02:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9846.02s)]
*  Like everything's the same. [[02:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9847.98s)]
*  Every wrinkle of the face is the same. [[02:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9848.9s)]
*  If that was my brother, if my brother looked, [[02:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9850.580000000002s)]
*  I'd be like, wait a minute, we're not twins? [[02:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9853.900000000001s)]
*  So we're not twins. [[02:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9855.94s)]
*  Like what? [[02:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9857.02s)]
*  It looks Photoshopped. [[02:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9857.86s)]
*  The mouth definitely looks Photoshopped. [[02:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9858.7s)]
*  How so? [[02:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9859.94s)]
*  Because like you said, the teeth are exact. [[02:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9860.980000000001s)]
*  Yeah, exact in the exact position, right? [[02:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9862.94s)]
*  Yeah, they're not even almost. [[02:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9866.300000000001s)]
*  Right, it looks fake. [[02:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9868.060000000001s)]
*  It looks like somebody doctored up, somebody used AI. [[02:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9869.140000000001s)]
*  Same cracks in the lips right here. [[02:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9871.62s)]
*  Pretty much, right? [[02:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9873.78s)]
*  That's probably bullshit. [[02:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9874.86s)]
*  That mouth is Photoshopped. [[02:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9875.78s)]
*  Yeah, so you can't tell what's real [[02:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9877.1s)]
*  and what's not real online anymore. [[02:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9879.86s)]
*  You can't tell. Nothing's real. [[02:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9882.58s)]
*  Nothing. You literally can't tell. [[02:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9884.02s)]
*  You have to operate from the idea that this is not real. [[02:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9885.62s)]
*  You have to start there now. [[02:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9889.18s)]
*  Right, but also this is just the beginning. [[02:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9890.900000000001s)]
*  Like what are we gonna be looking at five years from now? [[02:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9892.980000000001s)]
*  We're gonna be looking at indescribable experiences [[02:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9895.1s)]
*  that are indistinguishable from reality. [[02:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9897.980000000001s)]
*  Not just like images, but you're gonna be able to like, [[02:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9900.7s)]
*  you're gonna be able to have experiences that aren't real. [[02:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9904.58s)]
*  Do you think that the like metaverse thing [[02:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9907.98s)]
*  is gonna take off? [[02:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9910.06s)]
*  Like people are gonna be plugging in to the- [[02:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9910.98s)]
*  Yeah, if it gets good enough. [[02:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9912.859999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and cheap enough. [[02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9914.259999999998s)]
*  Cause it's kind of expensive. [[02:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9915.619999999999s)]
*  It's expensive, and it's also weird [[02:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9917.46s)]
*  to have something in your face. [[02:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9918.82s)]
*  People feel weird like wearing this big clunky thing. [[02:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9919.9s)]
*  But if you can sit down and attach something to your head [[02:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9922.3s)]
*  and then all of a sudden you're in another world, [[02:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9925.58s)]
*  you're an avatar flying on a fucking dragon. [[02:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9927.14s)]
*  We're gonna do it. [[02:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9929.859999999999s)]
*  I mean, it sounds, isn't like Red Band really into that? [[02:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9930.74s)]

*  He goes in there every night, [[02:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9936.34s)]
*  he has like parties and stuff. [[02:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9937.3s)]

*  He's a video game guy, loves the internet. [[02:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9941.78s)]
*  Matt was telling me, like he took him to a comedy, [[02:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9943.74s)]
*  you can do a type five at a comedy club there. [[02:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9946.14s)]
*  It's crazy. [[02:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9948.54s)]
*  Well, Zuckerberg showed me that too. [[02:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9949.380000000001s)]
*  There's a metaverse comedy club. [[02:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9951.14s)]
*  Yeah, but he's like, you had to like know people to get in [[02:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9952.5s)]
*  and he's famous. [[02:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9955.18s)]
*  I was like, this is nuts that this already exists to me. [[02:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9956.02s)]
*  Well, it's just the beginning. [[02:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9960.06s)]

*  And whatever it's gonna be like 20 years from now, [[02:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9963.7s)]
*  it's gonna be something really wild. [[02:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9965.7s)]
*  Isn't it weird to think that like, [[02:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9967.42s)]
*  you might just exist forever in the metaverse talking [[02:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9968.740000000002s)]
*  because you've done so many podcasts. [[02:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9972.380000000001s)]
*  They'll just be able to cut and paste [[02:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9974.18s)]

*  What if you're a god in the future? [[02:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9978.7s)]
*  Well, they'll be able to get a map of how I think [[02:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9980.140000000001s)]
*  and how I go over things and how I go, well, maybe not. [[02:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9982.54s)]
*  Let's look at that. [[02:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9985.380000000001s)]
*  And then they'll apply that sort of thinking [[02:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9986.220000000001s)]
*  and they'll be able to do podcasts with me, [[02:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9989.02s)]

*  who get tattoos of you. [[02:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9996.06s)]
*  I'm like, future civilizations are gonna be like, [[02:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9997.26s)]
*  who was this man? [[02:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=9999.66s)]
*  He must've been someone important, [[02:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=10001.460000000001s)]
*  maybe a shaman or a Brahmin. [[02:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=10003.5s)]

*  Look at him. [[02:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=10014.18s)]
*  That's a young Einstein too. [[02:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=10015.02s)]
*  I was training a thing to have, I was looking into this. [[02:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=10015.86s)]
*  They can already do it. [[02:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=10020.02s)]
*  What? [[02:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=10021.02s)]
*  Let me hear this. [[02:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=10022.14s)]
*  They don't have their voices for some reason. [[02:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=10024.54s)]

*  You can kind of tell that it's not real, [[02:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=10038.1s)]
*  but that's just because it's first generation. [[02:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigVe4IqsBM&t=10039.62s)]
