# Joe Rogan Experience #1542 - Cameron Hanes
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [September 29, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EURQLMDNdw8)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day.
*  Hello, campaigns. What's up? What's going on, buddy? Good to see you.
*  Oh, man. It's good to be here in the spaceship. Look at this. It's weird, right? Yeah. It's very polarizing.
*  People love it or hate it. A lot of people hate it. Oh, really? Yeah. I think it's cool. I like it. Yeah. I don't love it.
*  I don't think it's perfect, but I think it's interesting. We did it really quickly. I mean, we decided to move here within six weeks we were here.
*  I said this on a video on my Instagram, but I should probably say it again. You live up there in Oregon. Yes. And I said something incorrect.
*  I said about there was a guy who got I know there was one guy who got arrested for lighting fires.
*  And I thought I'd read some other shit about activists getting arrested for lighting fires or Antifa people. Shouldn't you call them activists? What do you call them?
*  Crazy people. Idiots. Morons. But it's not true. So sorry if you heard me say that. Jamie informed me of it today.
*  It's one thing about being out of the loop. You don't know when people are mad at you. Yeah. But this time I agree with them. Like they're mad at me for something that.
*  Well, somebody did get arrested for the Molotov cocktail. I read that. Right. That turns out to be true. He got arrested and then he got out of jail and then lit some more things on fire.
*  But see, here's the thing. Like when you say Antifa, like what does that mean? Right. It could just be a crazy person.
*  And that's what a lot of Antifa is. Like that guy that shot that dude in Portland, the guy that shot the Trump supporter. Yeah. That guy's a crazy person. Yeah. He's dead now. Right.
*  He was a crazy person. Yeah. You know, just decided to pile on to this thing and become an activist.
*  But that's when you don't have like an entry examination. Yeah. Anyone can just join up. Show up. Yeah. You just show up and now you're Antifa. Yeah. And now you're a part of the resistance. Yeah.
*  But I fucked up. I said that people, a lot of people were arrested. I read some shit about it.
*  I don't remember where I read it about all these people getting arrested for lighting wildfires, but it wasn't true. It was just this one guy. Well, for sure. I think they should have been arrested. Maybe that's the difference.
*  Well, I see. That's why it made sense to me because they had been arrested for lighting fires in or that they hadn't been arrested.
*  They had been seen lighting fires and throwing them into the mayor of Portland's apartment lobby. Yeah. And they were lighting fires out in the street in front of his apartment.
*  It just when someone said, Oh, look at all these arrests. They're arresting people for lighting fires. I just went, Oh, that makes sense. And I just repeated it.
*  I'm very upset with myself. I don't like when I repeat shit. That's not true. That's definitely not true. Yeah. I mean, it's a it's a hard time, though. It's your spot up there, though. That's your area. Yeah. It's it's you know, people and they find out. Oh, you're from Oregon. So what do you think of all?
*  You know, it's just it's kind of embarrassing to to just because I understand people have an opinion and they want change and they you know, maybe it's maybe some of it is valid.
*  But I don't agree with 100 nights of burning or however many nights has been of just burning and ruining a city. I don't I don't understand how that I mean, eventually maybe one night have a protest.
*  Do whatever. Get your message out. Talk to people. But just destruction. I don't get that. I think it's exactly what we were just saying that you get enough people that join on to a movement and the movement has no like directive or leaders.
*  They're just they're showing up and you're going to get morons that do things like light books on fire and throw them into the lobby like doing all the things that they're doing trying to break into the federal building.
*  It's just people are nuts, man. And people are there. Everyone's so many angry people right now, too. That's also part of the problem. So many people are angry. It's a crazy time.
*  And so many people are out of work because of covid because everything shut down. So people are furious because of that. You know, they don't know what to do. It's just it's one of those things where it doesn't doesn't seem like there's a solution on the horizon for a lot of people.
*  And so then they're like, we got to burn this system down. Fuck the system. And so, yeah. But Portland is a fun place. I love going up there. I've always loved Portland. Well, I'm I'm proud to be from Oregon. I mean, Oregon is a great state.
*  This I don't know. It's really hard to support just destruction. Yeah. And it's just it doesn't seem like it's helping anything, you know, and then, you know, all the conspiracy theories. Oh, it's the fucking, you know, they're trying to bring down democracy. It's Russia and China involved. And George Soros is funding it.
*  There's a million different versions of the conspiracy of to why there's so much chaos in the streets. You know, it's it's a weird time. Yeah. I mean, Eddie Bravo was right about a lot of stuff. Alex Jones is right about a lot of stuff. Right. Yeah.
*  You know, it's it's it is crazy because you start and I've even texted you about this about wondering about, you know, people would always say, well, do the elites run the country and they're controlling this and media and this and that. And then then you start wondering or thinking or seeing.
*  And you see all this is like, maybe that's true. Maybe the elites have been controlling everything and they're still trying to with this covid and the fear and everything they're doing just they can control people with fear. And that's what's happening.
*  I get super suspicious when people use that term, the elites. Yeah. How do you get in that group? I don't even know what that is. Is there a meeting? What is what is the elites? What does that mean? I don't like them. I know that. That's I know enough about it. But I don't know if they're real. I mean, there has to be right there. There is a Bilderberger meeting. Right. Yeah. The Bilderberg group, they get together and they meet up. But what do they do? I don't know. You know, maybe they just talk about interest rates. Yeah. Yeah. Well,
*  we were talking about this and I would probably I'm a bowhunter. All right. So I don't like the politics and trying to explain all this. Stay in your lane. I try to stay in my lane. But I do have thoughts on other things. And we were talking about like if you even look at the movie 300 and Gladiator, like the old time, the the weird they would say boy lovers and you know, it's like these politicians. It's like a toned down version of that still. It's like they're so po.
*  Politicians. I don't know why Trump got elected. They were so people so sick of quote politicians. But there still is that that influence and that them controlling and then just so much different than the people. You know? Yeah. Well, I think that's how you become successful as a politician. You have to be a politician. You have to be like deeply embedded. And again, this is just guessing. I'm a moron, too. I should stay in my lane. I don't know what I'm saying. Yeah. But I would imagine that the only way you really
*  get successful as a politician is you have to be connected to all these other people that are connected to all these special interest groups and lobbies. And that's why you have to go to these fundraisers. And that's why you have to mingle. And and then it becomes normal. You become a part of you know, it becomes a normal part of the system. Yeah. And I would imagine that that's the case with almost any big business. Like that's why guys get together. The big business man get together and golf. Yeah. Right. They get together and they talk shit and they figure out their plan and they work out deals and stuff. And yeah. And some of them do.
*  It on Fuck Island with Jeffrey Epstein. You know, I think that's a lot of no. What do you mean? I haven't heard anything about that. What is that place? It's beautiful. There's a lot of beautiful trees and beautiful warm water. And why is it called Fuck Island? I don't know. I don't call it that. I call it a nice place to meet nice people. Right. I mean, how crazy is that? That's just gone. It's like, hey, was not a story. Yeah. Was that a thing? Just went away. But that sounds way crazier than Antifa lighting fires in Portland. Yeah. Yeah. And it's true. Right. That's a real one.
*  Yeah. I can talk about that. And they do like, well, yeah, it is what it is. Yeah. Yeah. I'm so mad at myself for saying that story and have it not be true. Jamie showed it to me. I was like, did I say that? Yeah. What is it like working with a moron? Is it weird? Like, no, really? Like having someone like me being a moron like I am being responsible for steering the ship and your livelihood is connected to this. This has got to be strange. Right. You're hitting the buttons, man.
*  Well, you got to take the good with the bad, I guess. Is that how you look at it? Yeah. So how does a self-proclaimed moron have the president of the United States? Well, he's clearly a moron, too. Does that make sense? Tweeting about you, mentioning you. When do you actually when does him and Biden get here?
*  What's not going to happen? See, Joe Biden's a smart one. He's like, well, that guy's a moron. I'm not going on his podcast. But Trump is a smart one. We got we got problems. Trump is like, that makes sense to me. I'm in. Well, Trump is like, I mean, he's obviously deeply again, way out of my lane. Just talking nonsense. But he's obviously connected to business. He's a huge businessman. Yeah. Successful businessman, but not a politician in any way, which other than becoming president. Yeah. Which is fucking bananas. Yeah. You know,
*  part of it is good, man. Part of it's good just to expose the system and just to let everybody know, hey, look, what can happen? Yeah. Look out. Look how can go wrong. He has a whole fake news has really got some traction. Yeah. Fake news is a real thing now. I was a fake news. Yeah. I was pretty impressed with the the treaty we just signed with Israel. I mean, remember Jared Kushner got he got beat up a lot and Trump for appointing and whole family and how everybody's involved in and his.
*  His operation, basically, but you know, like he, Jared Kushner wasn't qualified. And then here we signed this great treaty with Israel. And how'd that happen? I don't know. See, if Jared Kushner was not married to Trump's daughter, I think people would look at him very differently. The problem is he's married to Trump's daughter and he looks like Damien from the Omen. If you see photos of him and Damien side to side. I haven't. Dude, he looks like a goddamn horror movie. Like he's the devil's son.
*  He's perfect, like slick back hair, perfect angular features, thin and always wears a suit. Yeah. Jamie, show me what's up.
*  Push some buttons. He looks he looks very similar to the Omen. Well, whatever he did, it was good. Come on, son. Look at that. Yeah. Look at him and look at Damien. Look at that. Yeah. Come on. Come on. Right there. Come on. That's almost exact, bro. Is that Photoshop? No. It could be Photoshopped.
*  No. And even showing off his watch. Look at my watch. The devil gave me this watch. That's not Gucci.
*  Look at that. Those two up in the that looks like a horror movie. Like, oh, they're here. They're bringing in the Antichrist. Oh, the one the far left with Donald Trump being blurry and him that one right there. Click on that one. Come on, son. That's some satanic shit. If that wasn't a Stephen King movie, you'd be like, oh my God, they've got to stop him. They've got to stop him. Well, whatever powers he's used, it worked out good for this treaty.
*  Just got good features. Yeah. You know, the kid's getting a hard time because he's got good angular features. Yeah. I wish I looked that good. I do, too. Yeah. Smooth skin. Oh, man. Nice. Young. Yeah. Tight. Yeah. Everything's smooth. No, no, no ruddiness to his skin. No. Yeah. I don't know. The problem is, if you're married to the president's daughter and then you get a big job in the White House, automatically you're fucked. We're just going to say automatically you don't deserve that position.
*  There's no way. And Biden's son is the same thing. Probably. Right. Yeah. I mean, that doesn't come up too often either. And that's pretty scandalous. Right. That thing where, you know, someone got fired because Biden forced it through. Well, how did that work? Do you remember that? Oh, no, I better. Let's let's avoid the retractions. I wish there was something going on that I was really excited about. Like this is good. Like Elk Honey. Yes. Oh, see you in that soon. I know.
*  I know that's what days away. That's the thing about it. So I was just in Colorado. No reception. You verse the animals reading the country, reading the wind. That's I mean, that's life. That's none of this BS. Yeah.
*  Well, that's the beautiful thing about the woods as a reset is that when you're out there and quiet, you realize, oh, none of these animals out here give a fuck about me. They don't know who I am. They don't know what is happening in the world. They're not aware of Kamala Harris and Joe Biden.
*  No, Nancy Pelosi or Donald Trump. They don't know nothing. This is out there trying to eat grass and not get eaten. And breed. Yeah. And you know, John, when John was there last year, he was like 18 yards away from a mountain lion.
*  John. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I thought we saw I think when I was there, I saw one. But the guys hunting saw two during the day mountain lions and just out because the snow came.
*  And then the weird snow storm went from 90 degrees one day to 20 degrees the next day. How does that happen? I don't know. Jared Kushner. That's how Satan. Yeah. Exactly. Had to be. But anyway, the animals were they didn't know what to do. So the lions were out hunting hard. They were like, this is great.
*  Animals weren't moving because they didn't know they were kind of caught off guard. Normally the seasons change as a gradual. And I think the bull stopped bugling. The deer stopped moving. Normally the bucks are in velvet. So they're out feeding and just in their normal routine.
*  Everything stopped because the snow and this cold temperature came. But the lions were they're like, oh, yeah, no, we're going to the hot pocket section and killing some deer and elk. And it was it was crazy. But we saw two lions and then the bear were kind of gone for a little while. But then they popped back out, too. And it was good hunting for sure.
*  Yeah. That video that you posted, the bear in the elk calf, that's that's something that people need to see. You need to see the people who love wild animals. I understand it. But there's there's a real cruelty to the way they die in the wild. Yeah. That if people get upset about hunters, like you kind of I understand that you wouldn't want a beautiful animal to die. I do understand that. But you kind of need to know that they're going to die no matter what happens. And this is the way they die.
*  They usually die. Yeah. And it's a rough way to go. You know, bears eating animals like that. It's it's so hard to watch, too, because the bears don't really kill them first. Now. And and the bear this year was a hard year for the elk calves because so the cows were pregnant drop, we call it dropping the calf. So they were given birth and the bear were just following knowing that the calves are going to be dropped. They'll be on the ground. They can't stand up and they could just kill them pretty quick. And so they were fined.
*  Like two cat two dead elk calves a day every day. And this was a hard year specifically because it was dry in southern Colorado. So the grass didn't grow. Normally, the grass would be taller, there'd be more cover. Elk calves could hide better. They were just laying on the open. The bears were like, oh, okay. There you are. Go kill them and start eating them. And it was just they they hammered them this year. I mean, normally I talked to the game warden there when I was on that hunt.
*  Great guy legend, Bob's his name, and he's been there for many years. And he said that normally in that area, there's about I think twenty three elk calves survive a year out of one hundred. And this year is down on the teens because of the the grass was they couldn't hide.
*  So it's gonna be a rough year. It's tough to survive anyway. I mean, twenty three out of one hundred is isn't you know, don't quote me on these numbers, but it was just the point is I want to make it was less this year because there wasn't the cover. Yeah, it's a it's a rough world, man. The world that they live in. You know, when we were there with Johnny Hamilton and he was telling us that story, I've told the story before on the podcast about how they were tracking a cat and they they found the cat's tracks and then elk tracks and then no more cat tracks. And then they found the elk and they found the elk and they found the elk and they found the elk and they found the elk and they found the elk and they found the elk and they found the elk and they found the elk and they found the elk and they found the elk and they found the elk and they found the elk and they found the elk and they found the elk and they found the elk and they found the elk
*  about a hundred yards later, the cat had jumped on the Elks back and taken out a big bull elk. Yeah. I mean, those they are amazing creatures. They live in the snow. They live in cold weather in the mountains. They live solo. They hunt solo. They only interact with other animals mostly when it's time to breed. Right. Yeah. Cats. Yeah. Yeah. And they kill cats, specifically kill a lot of big bucks. And the reason why is because those big old bucks, they like being
*  by themselves. They don't like being, they just kind of go off by themselves bed and they live a solo life. Basically, that's easy target for a cat. So cats kill a lot of big bucks. Yeah, it makes sense. But they're, I love that they're there. This is the thing about predators. It's like, I don't want to get eaten by a mountain lion, but I love that they exist. I don't want to get eaten by a grizzly, but I love the fact that there are grizzly bears. Yeah.
*  Like all of it is, it's so, it's such an interesting world, the world of the wild, the world of predator and prey. And when you're out in there, you feel so vulnerable and you feel so fleshy. Like, like whenever I see an, like when you, even when you, like you, you're taking care of an elk that you killed and you feel their hide. Yeah. You're like, God, I'm so weak. Like everything that we have is so soft and they're just, they live in this life that's so, it's so robust. Oh.
*  If they survive, like the bull I just killed, the taxidermist, he just texted or sent me a message on Instagram of the ivory. So that's the, the back teeth of the bull. They call them ivories. They're ivory. People make jewelry out of them. But he said they're the most worn ivories he's ever seen. So the bull was very old. And so you can imagine a bull that's in that country, 10, 12 years old, where you're living outside every single day. I mean, we still have,
*  we still have to stay outside one time. And it's just like, Oh my God, I thought I was going to die. People do die. People do die from hypothermia. They're out every single day living in the mountains. So when you see their hide, they're built for that. When their muscle, I mean, that seven, 800 pound bull elk that never eats meat, obviously just eating grass, solid muscle, you know, those things are just built. It's incredible. And also with all those lions and the bears trying to survive that Johnny, you mentioned Johnny
*  they took eight lions out of that country this year and we're still seeing them during the daylight every day. They have so much food. Oh, yeah. That's the thing. If it's good hunting lions are going to be there. Yeah. It's, it's just the world that they live in. So spectacular. They're trying to introduce, reintroduce wolves to Colorado. Oh God. Don't know about all that. Yeah. That's ridiculous. You think that's ridiculous? Yeah. No, I'd like to have a biologist sit down and talk to like a biologist who's
*  pro reintroduction of wolves, sit down with something like you and have like a conversation about it. Yeah. Here's the problem. Here's what they do. They say it all sounds good. Hey, let's wolves are a big part of the whatever. Let's get them back in where they used to be. Let's make, cause even you said you like knowing there's grizzly bear out there and you don't obviously don't want to be attacked, but just knowing they're there and maybe seeing them and, and wolves are amazing animal. The problem is they make, they make all these,
*  um, Oh, I don't know. I don't want to say promises, but they sell it a certain way. Like we're going to have this many packs of wolves and they'll, they'll breed this, this often. And then, so we'll have a carrying capacity of this many wolves. Well, so once the wolves are there, then it's, Oh no, we can't kill wolves. Cause they, they sell it like they're going to manage them, you know, cause we're going to keep this many. But then it's like, once they're there, they're like, Oh no, we can't hunt wolves. I was like, well, no, I thought you were going to, I thought we were going to manage them.
*  So that then everything goes back to nothing. And then you got all these protests with all these pro wolf advocates saying we can't have wolves. So they're there. They're breeding over and over and over. You got all these wolves running around killing. Cause that's what they do. And we can't hunt them because now we've backtracked.
*  Well, it is one of those things where they promise that like they have a number, like if we have 2000 wolves in this particular area, then we'll open it up to management. Management means is they'll have tags and they'll put tags available for hunters and they can go and hunt wolves. People that hear that, they're like, wait, why would you like, they hear you don't eat wolves. Why would you hunt wolves? Wolves are beautiful. Wolves are like dogs. Yeah. But I understand that and I'm on that perspective.
*  I get that perspective. It makes a lot of sense to me, but people need to know that there was a reason why they wiped him out in the first place. Like they, they were destroying cattle and they were, I understand too, like, Hey, they were here first. I get that. I get that perspective. But if you eat meat and you like having cattle, these ranchers, it's a struggle as a rancher as it is. And if ranchers get hit with wolves and wolves start taking out their calves and taking out their cattle, like it's, it can be devastating. They, you know, like in Alaska, they kill people's dogs.
*  They do a lot. There's a lot of wild videos of wolves tearing apart dogs in people's backyards. And wolves are just doing wolf things. It's what they do. It's not, it's not their fault, but once they're there, they're not going anywhere. Well, places where they exist, they have a different perspective on them. I remember I was in BC and I ran into this man at the airport and I forget why he came up to me. I think like I had a, maybe I had a hunting t-shirt on or something, something hammering.
*  Maybe it was a keep hammering shirt, but he, he came up to me and he said, uh, are you a hunter? And I said, yeah, yeah. And he goes, uh, he goes, yeah, we, uh, we do a lot of hunting up here. He goes, uh, I do a lot of wolf hunting. And, uh, I was like, you will, you will find like just right out, right out of the gate at the airport. Yeah. I'm a wolf hunter. Yeah. And I go, why do you hunt wolves? Like, what do you hunt wolves for? This is like early on in my, my hunting days. Right. And he's like, if you don't hunt them, man, you got a real problem with their numbers. He goes, uh, and he was telling me stories about friends that have ranches and they get a
*  attack by wolves, you know, that the cattle get attacked by wolves. And he was telling me that they take barrels of frozen meat and that they freeze them with water. And then they leave these big bricks of frozen meat and water, uh, out for wolves.
*  And then he's got Stan set up where he, uh, who waits for wolves because it takes a long time for them to eat through the meat and the ice, like this, like a barrel filled with, and you know, he just kind of sets up shop and he goes, and he goes, some of them are just too smart.
*  He goes, I'll set that up. And they're like, Nope, I know what that is. It won't come anywhere near it. He goes, you'd be amazed how smart they are. But it's just people that live like in BC and Northern BC, there's a lot of wolves. They have wolf issues up there. And those people, they have a completely different attitude about what a wolf is.
*  Yeah. But it's the people that know wolves. It's just the same thing in BC with the grizzly bears, you know, I mean, and anybody who's, who's out in the bush knows, Hey, grizzlies are a big problem out here.
*  But the people in the city make the decisions with the vote. Right. And that's what happened when they banned grizzly bear hunting in BC. And that's what would likely happen in Colorado with wolves. Yeah, most likely. Yeah. I mean, Colorado is Denver and Boulder. Yeah. Right. That's the big population. Very liberal.
*  And they're not going to be into shooting wolves. Anybody who's out there, like where I was and the guys I'm hunting with, there's no no debate. No wolves. Yeah. And that's, yeah, I mean, some people say like the reason that's the case is because people want a lot of animals that they can hunt. Like this is the argument like Steve Rinell has actually talked about this before with Alaska that Alaska has done this sort of over management of wolves in certain areas because they want to make sure there's a high number of moose and caribou.
*  And, and deer so that people will come up there to hunt. Yeah. You know, because they're trying to maintain and he's like, there's an argument that that's not the natural ecosystem. Is it the natural ecosystem doesn't include skyscrapers. That's true, too. So yeah, I mean, humans do infringe on that. That's part of it. So it's never going to be. It's never going to be like cavemen or Native American times. It's never going to be back to that. So we're trying to balance it as best we can. And, you know, big game animals are a real threat.
*  They're a resource. They're a resource for the states that they, you know, hunters do come in. They contribute to a lot of things. The habitat, the conservation, different projects. And that's hunting money. So if there's a bunch of wolves there, you can't hunt the wolves because these groups have have protested and made it illegal. And then the wolves are killing all the deer and elk. Yeah, that's not going to work.
*  Yeah, it's it's it's an interesting situation because I love the fact that there are places where there are wolves like whenever we've gone to B.C. to John and Jen's place up there.
*  Alberta. Yeah, I'd say. Sorry, Alberta. Whenever we've gone up there in Canada, you know, there's wolves in that area. Yeah, there's something cool about it.
*  I remember we saw one once in the distance crossing crossing a road pretty far away. Yeah, but I mean, that's like the closest I've ever been to a wolf. But just seeing it crossing that road and this is like, look at that. I know.
*  And wolf. Yeah. And I think that we get a we get our bear license, but then we also get a license for wolves. I think it's twenty five or fifty bucks. It's pretty cheap.
*  And there's always a hope that you'll see a wolf and be nice to get an arrow in one. And well, they want to control them because they destroy the population of the the moose and the elk.
*  And it's you know, the are this for people that don't there aren't in that world. They're like, well, why would you why would you want to kill a wolf?
*  Like, why don't just let them sort it out? Like, that's the California argument. Yeah. What they want to do, essentially, the people that manage wildlife, a lot of them, at least in California, they would like to eliminate hunting and let the animals all take care of themselves in some sort of normal wild way and force everyone to eat tofu.
*  For she'd eat tofu until you grow breasts. Right. I think that's the plan. I think it's written somewhere. I don't think that's true. But I do think that they they don't like the idea of human beings.
*  They like there's things that people will accept, like deer hunting. People have deer hunted forever. A lot of people have eaten deer. Deer tastes good. That makes sense. Yeah. But as soon as you move into things like mountain lions, like even if you tell people that mountain lions taste good, they don't want to hear that. No. They do not want to hear you're eating mountain lions.
*  They're not seeing lions, so they don't think there's anything out there. But California is riddled with mountain lions. Yeah, there's quite a few. Yeah, there's quite a few. And they also don't have bad experiences with them. I think the people that have bad experiences with them have a completely different attitude. Yeah.
*  You have one on your back. You want to hunt it. Yeah. Now it's not. You're not in Disney. You're not in a Disney movie. Now you're a part of the food chain and you realize like, oh, I'm way down here. I'm not up here. When I'm in my house and I've got a gun, I'm up here. But when you're out in the woods and you don't have a gun and you're hiking and you realize you're being stalked. Yeah. There's a crazy video that I saw once from Colorado, this guy. And there's a mountain lion slowly walking towards him on this trail.
*  And he's trying to figure out what to do. And he's talking to it. And he's like saying, hey, get the fuck out of here. Yeah. And you know, you realize like he got away. Yeah. The mountain lion gave up on him, luckily. But that could have been the end of that guy's life. That thing is just slowly moving towards him and trying to figure out whether or not I could eat him. And that's all it does. It's not like I've never done this before. I don't know if I can do this. Like it takes down things every single day. Yeah, I mean, it definitely. Yeah. When it's when a predator locks eyes on you like that.
*  It's definitely a different feeling. I mean, yeah, it's they're good at what they do. I mean, they kill. Yeah. I remember that Under Armour commercial that you did where they had a wolf in the commercial with you. Yeah. And he said he said they could only get the wolf to growl one time because after that it was over. Like you could not control the wolf.
*  No, we we to make it growl, to make it mad, we gave it meat and then took it away. So it was very upset. It didn't get the meat. But once it got in that because it was obviously a tame wolf or a it'd been in movies, trained wolf.
*  But once you introduce meat and it got in that mindset of of meat. Yeah. Then that was that was going to be it. Yeah. This is the commercial. It's an awesome commercial. How long ago was this commercial?
*  Um, I'm not sure. Quite a few years ago, right? Yeah. Like four or five at least.
*  2013. Damn. Seven years ago. Yeah. It's a dope commercial. Yeah. And it's cool. The wolf was awesome. I mean, wolves are amazing. How big was it? It was tall. I mean, I'd say it's probably 120 130 pounds, I guess. But they're a lot taller than what you like compared to a dog. A normal dog.
*  How come they don't do more of these commercials? I don't know. So the whole idea is that you and the wolf are in competition and that you won out. Yeah. See, I got the bull and it's mad. And so that's when it did that growling. Yeah. Yeah. And then after after did that, that was it. You can tell it's got a collar. Back that up a little bit.
*  Back that up a little bit. Look, look at that. Yeah, it has. Well, it's just a little, it's a little rope, but that's had his hair matted down right there. Yeah. But it's a little rope. That's someone's dog, bro. Yeah. That's a husky. No, it was a wolf. But it's yeah, it had a little piece of rope on it. Have you ever heard the John Dudley story that he told on the podcast? Yeah. Yeah. Being surrounded by or something like that. They fucked up. And it was like that scene in the gray. They killed an elk and they didn't realize they killed an elk literally in the wolf's den.
*  Oh, God. Like where they killed the elk. There was like bones all over the place in the area. And they're like, oh, shit. And these wolves circled them and decided they were going to take the elk. Wow. Yeah. And what? Where was that? It was in B.C.
*  And it was him and a guide and the guide only had a certain amount of bullets. Oh, and he only has certain amount because John only uses a four hour criver. Yeah. So John shot the elk with one quiver or one arrow from his quiver.
*  And then he had three left and he killed two other wolves and he had one arrow left and they had shot three wolves together. Like the wolves were running at them, running at them. He killed two wolves that were running at him. Wow. Yeah.
*  And then one of them, he thinks, was the alpha male was sitting on the top of this ridge, like at about, I think he said about 50, 60 yards staring at him. And he drew back for that one. And then he took off. And then the whole pack just took off with them. They'd abandoned the situation because they realized what was going on.
*  But when they shot one, he said all the other ones started howling like they try to figure out who was dead. Yeah. Check in. Yeah. Yeah. It's crazy. So like he's basically a weird little war with these wolves and they were they were making runs at him. That'd be intense. Oh, my God. He said our back was to a tree. And he goes, the guide only has a couple of bullets.
*  Yeah. And he doesn't want to shoot it. He just wants to scare it. They're not hunting grizzlies. So he brings a couple, I'll just grab a couple of bullets, put them in my pocket. And then here they are out in this situation where they're literally getting run up on by a pack of wolves.
*  Man, that's intense. I couldn't imagine. Wow. Yeah, I've seen I've seen what me and Roy the last it wasn't our last time to the hunt before I was hunting brown bear up in Alaska. And I wanted to kill in this area. There's so many brown bear. You kill two. So I wanted to kill one spot in stock and then hunting and hunting a tree and you can bait them up there because there's so many. And they just made this legal.
*  So my goal was to hunt both ways. Anyway, I killed a bear on the spawn stock and we were up in the tree trying to kill another bear. We're on this island. And it was I thought we saw a flash of a bear earlier and it's getting dark. It's like, well, never really.
*  It gets dark for about an hour and a half at this time. This was in July. And so we're just gonna stay in the tree the whole time. So we got in there at seven at night and we're gonna stay till five in the morning and just kind of ride out the darkness.
*  And I saw a flash and I thought we'd seen a bear earlier, but it didn't come in. And I thought, oh, the bears coming back. Turns out it was a wolf and it's a black wolf. And it came in there, have it on video. I haven't even shared it yet. But it was a black wolf and it stopped there at about 20 or 25 yards. And it was so just a wild wolf that close is pretty amazing. It's like their special animal.
*  It is. There's something about them because they're so damn smart. Yeah, it reminds me of that picture. Well, the wolf in the picture, I think. Did they send you one to that photographer? The wolf I have in the snow, the black one. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Remind me of that old studio. Yeah. Yeah. Just such a incredible animal. So yeah, I love wolves. I definitely don't think wolves should be wiped out or anything like that. But I just don't think wolves in Colorado is that's not that's not a thing we should do.
*  It's just reintroducing them just sets off a whole chain. I need to talk to somebody. There was a guy that is a pro. He's a biologist and he's pro wolf reintroduction. Yeah, I need to have you want to be on with him. Sure. Yeah, let's do it. It'd be an interesting conversation. Yeah. Let's do it. Explain. Yeah. There's a great video called How Wolves I think it's called How Wolves Change Rivers. Yeah, yeah, I've heard about it. Yeah, really interesting video about this guy talked about the reintroduction of wolves in the 1990s and the yellow.
*  Yeah. Yeah. And about how it's changed the ecosystem for the better. Yeah. But then I looked into the guy. Yeah. And the guy is better. Yeah. He's an eccentric character. Yeah. I'm not saying he's wrong, but he's he's into what's called rewilding. And he wants to reintroduce wild animals into places, including like the UK. He wants to reintroduce like he's like the UK used to have lions and elephants and all these different animals. He wants to see if we could find this gentleman. The guy.
*  It's his the concept is rewilding. And apparently he was like this really depressed guy was like urban, you know, doing the normal city thing and in England and got really into the idea of wildlife and reintroducing wildlife. Yeah, I feel bad for them over there. I mean, no hunting. Yeah, I mean, you know, me without hunting.
*  Well, that's your your your source of food. It's also what you train for, which when I first met you and I was like, why does this guy train so hard? Like, what is he doing? And then you like, I trained for bow hunting. I'm like, what? Like, what is happening when you bow hunt? Are you in a race? Like, what's going on? And then the first time you took me, I was like, oh, okay, I get it. Fuck. You have to be in like really crazy shape to pull this off. We don't.
*  You don't have to. But here what I know is like when hunting and you know how it is now you've done it for years. But in the mountains, there's so many. Yeah, you can get up and down the mountains. You can get around elk. But there's so many decisions that you have to make. And it's it's related on performance. So the higher level of performance, the better decisions you're going to make. I mean, like on these last hunts, I pretty much have an arrow knocked. I killed two bulls this year and a buck and a bear.
*  I've had an arrow knocked pretty much all day, pretty ready to go. And that's that can be fatiguing. Just this walking around slowly is tiring. So when you're at a heightened level for eight hours or more, 15 hours on some days and you're covering distance and it's like, I want to be ready at all times for anything that happens.
*  So I have an arrow knocked and I am ready. So like to do that, it's exhausting. If I if I didn't train the way I do, I couldn't do that. So who knows what that would result in as far as success. But people don't realize that. Just I mean, you know what it's like when you're hunting. It's like almost, you know, yoga poses all day. Essentially, I've heard people describe it as you know, and because you're going so slow and so controlled and every footstep is is controlled.
*  And, and, and just freezing. Like if you're in a situation and elk sees you and you have to freeze and you're holding your bow in your hand, you don't realize how damn heavy that thing is. And they don't have anywhere to go. And they'll just stand there. They'll they have nothing to do other than not let whatever they're unsure about kill them. And their vision is based on edge detection, right? I don't know. I think it's based on they see movement. Like that's why camel works. Yeah, because if you're if you're standing still, you're not going to be able to see the camera.
*  Yeah, because if you're if you're standing there, they don't say, oh, there's a dude in camo. They see the pattern and they see the edges as long as you don't move. Right. They don't see. Oh, right. Yeah, yeah. Movement. They definitely pick up when they see movement with the edge detection, like moving edges like this edge is moving towards that edge. Like, what is that? Yeah. But if you just stand still, right. But if you got that bow in your hand, like fucking hard can hold it like this. And you've got your bow out like this. And you're trying to hold it steady. Like you got maybe a minute, two minutes in you. Yeah. Before that fucker starts
*  to shake and then the elk is like, yeah. Yeah. And so you quickly realize when doing hunts like that, what being in shape means. Yeah. Oh, dude, I learned like last year. I thought I was in pretty good shape. So I went up there with you. And I was like, got that one hill that we went up to to get the bull that we wind up getting. Fuck, that was hard. And to get up there. And then the only good thing is I was in good enough shape that even though I was exhausted, I got my heart rate back quick. Yeah, I could I could I could I wasn't
*  like I was beaten down once I got up there. Yeah, because you still have to we had to get the wind right to get up the hill. Yeah, essentially what it was. And that recovery is all related to how good a shape you're in that thing that we had last year. I don't know if we ever played the clip. But that moment that we had up there was one of the wildest elk hunting moments. I don't know. I haven't I haven't been elk hunting for that long. That was the wildest thing I've ever experienced. There was your bull. There was how many bulls were up there? Like nine. Just screaming.
*  Bulls. But there was nine just on that one little hillside. Yeah, it was like it's what I would call a rut fest. Yeah. So there must have been some hot cows in there. Those bulls were coming in. They can smell a hot cow, which means the cow and estrus. So she's ready to breed.
*  I mean, she's a hot cow. I mean, those bulls are like, OK, I mean, bulls kill each other. Yeah, they kill each other all the time fighting. Well, tell the story about the one bull that you shot that you thought was in its bed, but was actually dead. Yes. Yeah.
*  No, so I I I snuck up and I saw this bull and its head was, I don't know, I mean, they get exhausted. So it's they can lay their head down a little bit and rest. I mean, middle of the day, they up all night, running, chasing, fighting.
*  So I saw this bull bedded and there's a big bull and I'm like, God, I don't know. I mean, it's not moving, but I don't know. Might as well. We've got to make sure. So I took my boots off and I started sneaking in, sneaking in, sneaking in. And I got to about 20 some yards and I'm like.
*  I don't know, but I don't want to be wrong. So I shot the bull, never moved, and it was already dead. It's been killed the night before it took a time in the neck. It looked like wow. And it got it was dead from fighting. Wow. Yeah.
*  Now, if it got killed the night before, can you salvage the meat? I don't think so. I mean, it didn't look good. Was it hot? It was a hot day. Yeah, it was hot. Yeah. Yeah. That's a bummer. I know. That's I mean, that's life in the wild. It is life in the wild. Yeah, it's we stumbled across one that had been killed, had been poked in the side, but it would have been quite a while ago and it was rotten and smelled terrible. This one, I'm guessing it was the night before. It was it wasn't that long, but the meat had turned. You realize that, you know, those
*  antlers on their head. That's not just for looks. No, that's their weapons of war. No. This this kid Wes on the last hunt that I just did in Colorado. He had some good footage of bulls fighting. Oh my God, dude. They're getting after it. It's wild. Yeah. Yeah. It's that's what makes it, you know, between that being they're so aggressive. And then the sounds they make of people haven't heard them. If you hear a bull bugle, it
*  20 or 30 yards, you can't believe how loud that is. Then you couple that with the antlers and the size of them and their aggressive nature. And they're coming. You can hear them coming through the trees and shits breaking. And as a hunter, you're sitting there and it's a lot to absorb. You know, it's like I saw somebody yesterday commented that they've been practicing at 20 yards on a target. And it's so small compared to a bull elk. It's like that must look like a house at 20 yards. How could you miss? And I'm like, well, people shoot over
*  the back of bulls all the time at 20 yards because it's so intense. Yeah. They just have never experienced it. Yeah. Screaming alone. It's like when you're near it. Yeah. They sound like something from Lord of the Rings. Yeah. Yeah. What an animal man. They have everything going for them. They do. The looks, the crazy antlers, the delicious meat, the crazy sounds they make, the wild places that they live in, the romantic but short life that they live. Yeah. They live this wild, crazy,
*  short life running away from mountain lions and bears and wolves and trying to get laid. Yeah. And then fight another elk to the death with swords that grow out of your head. Sounds like the life I want to live. No, no. I'd rather be the bow hunter. Oh, sleep in a nice place. And even if it's just a tent, yeah. Some place with a sleeping bag, shelter. Yeah. We'll get up and do this again tomorrow. They're out of a cooler. Meanwhile, they're out there surviving all night. Never, never lets up.
*  To me, it's my, one of my favorite parts of the year is just the reset of just experiencing the woods, the real wilderness. Yeah. Like where we're going in Utah and the mountains. What is it? Was that mountain range called?
*  Um, is it the Unitas or Unitas or something like that? Whatever it is. It's a gorgeous mountain range. Yeah. It's gorgeous and it just reminds you of what life must have been like before human beings ever existed, before they ever came to this part of the world. Just walking around with those animals. It's a reset. It's a real reset. Yeah.
*  And every time I eat that meat, I think about those, those moments. I know that connection. And when we talk about it, I mean ad nauseam probably, but that, that feeling. Yeah, that's pretty. Yeah. Yeah. You need a, you need, how you say it? I don't know. Try it. Is that a Native American word? Winter? I'm not sure. Who made that word up? Why'd they put those letters together like that? I'm not sure. But that is what it looks like. Yeah. Yeah.
*  That's part of what it looks like. Yeah. Really looks like the, um, yeah. Like that right there. That's, that's super, yeah, that's super familiar to me. Yeah. So gorgeous. Oh, it's beautiful. And we'll hike if, like we'll start where you see the beginning at the bottom of the screen and we'll go all the way to that far mountain range. And you know, if you're, if you're out of shape. Yeah. It's a rough go of it. You're just going to take a lot of shortcuts like into your decision making.
*  And make a lot of poor decisions. Yeah. And chances are you're not going to, I mean, you can kill people kill all the time. I see it all the time. Look, this guy killed and he doesn't run a marathon a day or whatever that people know you can get lucky. Yeah. You can. But if you're going to have sustained success for decades, multiple times a year, you're going to have to be at your best. Yeah. That's all there's to it. And I got to think that a guy like you who does ultra marathons and all this crazy working out, there has to be something.
*  To what you're eating. There has to be. Yeah. The fact that you're eating all this wild game is that your diet is like, how much of your diets meat? Oh, probably. I would say 40%. Just 40. Yeah. 40 to 50. What's the rest of it? Uh, carbs like potatoes and rice and fruits and vegetables. Just think about how much wild game you consume and how much, how protein rich that is and how like that dark red meat.
*  That you get from the animals, like how, how good that is for you. It has to have some sort of, uh, an effect on your, your physical abilities.
*  Because one of the things that people always marvel at with you is like, how the fuck does this guy do so many things? Like, how do you have the time to get up in the morning? I mean, there's been many times you've run a marathon a day. I know people are hearing this. Oh, this guy's full of shit. No, no, no, no. A marathon a day. You've run multiple marathons.
*  You've done days where you got up at three o'clock in the morning, more than one day where you ran a marathon and then went to work. Yeah. Or you've run 18, 19 miles, went to work and then finished the marathon off during your lunch break. And then you'll go lift weights and then you shoot your bow or you shoot your bow and then you lift weights. And like, it has to play a factor. I know there's just overall endurance and discipline and the fact that you've just always given yourself this hard workload and your body's adapted to it. I'm sure that's a factor.
*  That's something to do with it. But the fact that you're not injured all the time and the fact that you have all this energy, I got to think that that wild game plays a big factor in all that.
*  I would think. I mean, I eat wild game every day, every single day. And I know that has to help me recover. But I think aside from that, I think we're as humans, we're capable of so many amazing things. And it's like, I've, that's why the people who you've had on this podcast that I've
*  been obsessed with connecting with, because they're humans just like we are, but they, Goggins, they do incredible. It's like, how can the same species of, of whatever, so humans, just like everybody else walking around here, do such amazing things.
*  And I, I tried, I want to connect. I always want to connect with those people like Goggins, Courtney DeWalter, been running with Emma Coburn lately. She's an Olympic steeplechaser. She won the bronze at the last Olympic. I'm thinking she's going to win the gold at this Olympics this coming year.
*  So I try to think, well, how, how can they do that? They're the same species we all are. There must be something. Courtney's, Courtney's the toughest person I've ever been around. I've been around some tough people, but her mental toughness is, is unlike anything you've ever seen.
*  It's weird too. She seems so nice and normal. She is, but she's, yeah, she's, you know, couldn't get more, you couldn't find a more sweet person. But I've said this before where a dog will run itself to death. That's yeah. I took that picture right there. What is this?
*  It says, we estimate I slept fewer than four hours during my 105 hours on the Colorado trail is a combination of one minute trail naps and longer attempts in the RV. And sometimes they happen by accident during a group sunrise photo weekend at Bernie's. And she just passed out while she's doing this.
*  Yeah.
*  Less than ideal overall sleep time. But during the later days, the coughing and the wheezing preventing me from being able to fall asleep. Yeah. So that game needs major work. Just explain this whole thing that she was trying to accomplish. Right. Go to that one weekend of Bernie's. Yeah. So right here. So we stopped with the sun coming up to take a picture and she'd been going for 105 hours, which I, what is that over four days and slept for four hours. So we stopped to take a picture and she fell asleep. I mean, just passed out, but right after this picture,
*  she's up running. So that that other picture on the trail that I took with her and Maggie.
*  It's like a lot of people will look at this and they'll say, what kind of a human wants to do this?
*  This, this was a three minute nap right here. So it was going to be three minutes or maybe six minutes, but something sun had just come up. And incidentally, I just seen a big group of bucks in the dark about two hours earlier, about I think three in the morning. This is probably about five in the morning.
*  But I laid my pack on her legs there and my coats on her legs. She's the closest one. Maggie's is the second one who Maggie in her own right. She won the it's called bigs backyard ultra where they run four miles every hour for as long as you can do it.
*  Get four miles on and she won it last year. Courtney the year before was a first woman anyway. So these women are insane, but they took a three minute naps or a six minute nap right here. Then back up and that's reset your body.
*  I mean, it reset. It's like a control, all delete. So before this, she, Courtney was like so exhausted from all of this.
*  Maggie would ask a question and she'd answer barely audibly two minutes later. And so it was, it was me or Courtney than me than Maggie and Maggie would say something to Courtney.
*  Nothing. Two minutes later, she'd like, I could barely hear it. She'd answer whatever Maggie said, because her brain was like, they said her blood or her oxygen level brain was at 70%, which that was because of the coughing and lung issues and the high altitude and the dust and everything. So it just her brain wasn't working.
*  Let's explain what she was trying to do.
*  Yeah, she was okay. She was trying to the fastest known time to run the entire Colorado trail from Durango to Denver is eight days and something like two hours. I think she wanted to beat that by a day. So she was trying to run 490 miles from Durango to Denver with 90,000 feet of elevation gain total.
*  In seven days and to do that, I mean, it's a, you can't sleep is, I don't know. I don't know what the perfect answer is. She, she was about 22 hours, I think at one point ahead of the record, but she ended up in the emergency room just because her, her, she pushed so hard.
*  What I was going to say is animals will push.
*  Look how fucked up she looks. Yeah. So tired. Yeah. Look at her eyes. I know she just looks exhausted. Yeah. So that her pulse oxygen was 70, which it's supposed to be in the nineties. And if it's at 80 or 85, they say go immediately to the emergency room to the doctor and hers is 70.
*  So her brain just wasn't getting enough oxygen. And the doctor, I believe the doctor said that, because they said, well, what would happen if she keeps pushing? And he said, well, she'll die on the trail.
*  So, well, that's the problem with someone who's that tough. Yeah. That's what I was gonna say. They literally could push themselves to the point where their heart stops. And animals do that. We know that a dog will push itself. A horse will push itself so hard that they will die. Not my dog.
*  No, your dog. I throw the ball from four or five times in a row and he just, he drops the ball and lays down. He's like, bro, we're done. Yeah. Right. So some dogs, my dog, like Cashwood, he's a lab and all he wants to do, he'll do that. Right.
*  So, and horses do that. Horses die a lot or not a lot, but horses die from pushing. So most humans have that self-preservation mode where, I mean, most humans that like the hint of discomfort. Yes. I'm out. Yeah. So, but Courtney has that where, I don't know.
*  Well, goals are interesting because goals are what force you to pass your comfort zone and go into this crazy level where you realize you're only tapping into a very small percentage of what your body's capable of. Like even Goggins, what is his quote? That most people quit at 40%. 40%. Yeah. I think he's 100% accurate there. Yeah. I don't know. I'm throwing percentages around here. 40%. It sounds good. I mean, anybody knows. He knows. Right. But there's a thing that you do when you tap in.
*  When you tap into, like when you have a goal, when you say, I'm going to run 10 miles a day and I'm going to keep doing like, my friend Lex Friedman, the scientist, MIT guy. Yeah. He was on the podcast last week. One of the things that he was talking about was he did this challenge where he ran, was it four miles every four hours? Four.
*  That was, he did two challenges. That was the first one he did earlier in the year. Before it was four hours, four miles every four hours for 48 hours. Yeah. Or 48 miles or whatever it was. And just talking about it. I think Goggins. Yeah. Goggins set that up. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Him and Goggins are friends. Yeah. Okay. And then there were some crazy push ups, sit up, pull up challenge that they did as well. And Goggins said, whatever you do, I'm going to do double. Yeah. Which is just a nice little mindfuck when you're falling apart and you realize that Goggins is
*  doing twice what you're doing, but there's something about a goal like that. We set it in motion and you realize you have to do it where it forces you out of your comfort zone. It forces you to realize what your body is actually capable of, which most people just never do.
*  That's one of the great things about making someone compete. Like that's a great thing about training for a marathon or getting ready to do something is like when you have a goal and then you actually, and then you're committed to the thing and you actually have to go and do it.
*  Then and only then do you often find out what your body is actually capable of.
*  Yeah. Yeah. And still even, even during that goal or that performance, it's, uh, it's really hard to push. I mean, push and give all you got. I remember my kids, I would say, so did you give all you got? Yeah. Well, I didn't see you weren't throwing up.
*  You didn't throw up at the end. You know, it's like when you push, I don't even, I mean, it's not like I'm, I can say I do that every time either, but it's like, who really pushes with all they got?
*  Well, and what is that line? Like, what's after that line? Do you die?
*  I don't know.
*  And would you be happy if you push so hard that you died? Like, well, this is a good way to die.
*  Well, no, then you know, you gave your all.
*  That's, but, but isn't that, so that's what fascinates me with these people with the, with the Goggins and Courtney and, and, um, you know, also in some respects, Emma is like put is like performing at this level.
*  And it's just incredible to me.
*  It's like, so I want to know how can I take whatever mindset they have apply it to myself and what I do.
*  So that's all I've tried to do is like, I, and I've said a million times, I'm definitely not talented.
*  I spend time around people who are the best at what they do and hoping a little bit, I can pick up a little bit, um, get that mindset like Goggins flips that switch.
*  Courtney just has no switch.
*  It's just,
*  what is, what is talent?
*  I want to know what that is.
*  Like what, when you say you're not talented, because you're obviously very successful at both as a bowhunter, you're probably, I mean, if there's three top bowhunters on the planet earth,
*  you're in that top.
*  I don't know how many people are the best bowhunters on earth, but in my mind, you're, you're in that group.
*  What is talent?
*  Like if you're that good at bowhunting and I've seen you shoot targets 150 yards away and shoot balloons.
*  I mean, you seem to do some ridiculous shit.
*  You're obviously incredibly talented with a bow.
*  Like what is talent?
*  What does that mean to you when you say I'm not talented?
*  To me, I always equate talent to physical, um, like performance.
*  Like say running a hundred meters or like a freak athlete.
*  Yeah.
*  I equate talent to athleticism.
*  Right.
*  Like, uh, like a Mike Tyson or, uh, you know, uh, Polo Costa.
*  Yeah.
*  Some just freak athlete or runners.
*  I mean, runners, like they've, you know, we've been running since the beginning of time.
*  If you're one of the fastest to humans to ever run, you have to be talented.
*  That's yeah, that's talent.
*  Yeah.
*  There's things that people get that you are never going to get.
*  Right.
*  There's, there's a certain amount of speed people can generate.
*  A certain amount of power people can generate.
*  There's things that people can do, but the kind of things that you're doing, it's not required.
*  It just requires mental strength.
*  You're, you're doing endurance runs or these long ass mind torture runs.
*  They don't require that sprinting shit.
*  They just require that ability to keep going when you don't want to keep going.
*  Right.
*  Ability to maintain a pace that's painful.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's, and I've been, I was talking to the, cause after my hunt in Colorado, I went
*  and ran with Courtney, we did a 14,000 foot peak and then I ran with Emma the next day
*  and two totally different athletes.
*  Courtney's, you know, the, the eight, seven days crazy.
*  Emma's the 3000 meters.
*  And I was talking to them both about pain because Courtney's pain isn't as
*  intense, but it's for a long time, a week, you know, or days Emma's pain.
*  So for, she wants to break nine minutes in the steeplechase.
*  She never has nine or twos is her best, I believe.
*  And, uh, she'll have to break nine minutes probably to win the gold medal.
*  What's a steeplechase?
*  That's 3000 meters.
*  And it has the barrier, like the water barrier.
*  So you jump over, you jump over barriers and then there's a water barrier too.
*  Have you ever seen, seen them jump over?
*  I don't think I've ever seen a steeplechase.
*  Look up Emma.
*  Here it is.
*  This is it right here?
*  Yeah, that's her.
*  Wow.
*  So you jump over water.
*  Damn.
*  Look how much air she gets.
*  Yeah.
*  That's crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  So that's her.
*  So it's like, so she's, she has nine minutes and you, you can see her, like
*  there's a good video of her winning the world championships, Emma
*  Coburn world championship.
*  So this steeplechase thing, the water, you have to jump over the water.
*  What if you land in the water?
*  Yeah, they land in the water.
*  That's okay.
*  Yeah.
*  Just slows you down.
*  Um, they, they can't really clear that water.
*  So they plan on, on running and landing in the water.
*  What a weird thing to have a puddle in your run.
*  Yeah.
*  Isn't that weird?
*  Yeah.
*  So, so see, so that's right.
*  And she's, she's taller than like those, uh, um, the other girls.
*  They're usually from Ethiopia or Kenya.
*  Um, what a weird event.
*  You make them jump over a fence into a pond.
*  Yeah.
*  That's so bizarre.
*  I never knew this existed.
*  Like here's another one.
*  Yeah.
*  So they re some don't have the water, like just have that barrier there.
*  And I think there's four per lap.
*  How many people eat shit jumping over that barrier?
*  Where'd she go?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Oh, so, oh, I know.
*  Look at them legs.
*  Damn.
*  Yeah.
*  Some length.
*  She can.
*  So anyway, so she's got nine minutes of pain.
*  And I was asking her about, cause there's always a decision.
*  Like I watched her watch, uh, run this mile race and she was kind of in back
*  with about a lap to go and there's always that decision.
*  Like, do I want to go now and have a hurt really bad or just kind of,
*  ah, it wasn't my day.
*  Like, how do you decide to, to deal with that pain?
*  And so that's what I was asking her about.
*  Cause that's what fascinates me.
*  And what'd she say?
*  She's so there she did at nine 19th.
*  So she's got it down to nine Oh two.
*  Yeah.
*  She's got nine Oh two is her best now.
*  God damn.
*  I know.
*  Look at all those ladies are beaten down at the end of that.
*  Oh, so, so painful.
*  Yeah.
*  So she's from this little town, Crested Butte in Colorado.
*  And that's where I went and ran with her in it's, um, that's 10,000, 9,000 feet.
*  What was her, um, her answer to that?
*  To, to like the pain deciding.
*  She's just so she, like her, her brain is so focused in on that time, that
*  nine minutes where it's just like, and so it's just, she knows that if she
*  pushes now, it's only going to last this amount of time, you know, it's just.
*  This is what she's got to do.
*  This is how it works.
*  She's been doing it her whole life.
*  And so it was just pushed through.
*  So like, if she's so regimented on time from doing track her whole life, she'll
*  like say, well, can you meet me at, um, 10 and then we can get coffee and till
*  about 10 20 and then we'll go, we should be able to get to the mountain by about
*  10 30 and then we can run and we should be done.
*  I mean, like everything is like so regimented because her brain works like that.
*  So when she thinks about that pain, I think she just knows that it's going to
*  be the certain amount of time and then it's going to be over and this is what she does.
*  So it's, it's different than say a Courtney who's not going to, it won't be as intense
*  because you don't want sprinting when you're exhausted.
*  It just hurts.
*  Right.
*  It's so easy to be like, that's what I was asking her about because when I
*  watched her run the mile, that's not her event.
*  Her event is 3000 meters, which is more than a mile.
*  So I said, you could easily said, well, this isn't my event.
*  Um, you know, you've made that decision whether to go and pass all these other
*  girls and win, or just be like, this wasn't my night, this isn't my event, whatever.
*  And just a little bit less.
*  That's the way she takes the lead.
*  Just as you're talking.
*  Oh, just so this decision on should I go or should I stay right here
*  where it's comfortable?
*  This feels good.
*  I mean, it's still hard.
*  It's still an effort, but it's not the pain like going.
*  So when you make the right, when you make this decision, she almost went
*  right there, but didn't see that.
*  So when you make that decision, oh, this is, I think this is a world championship.
*  We just watched, but this is the full race.
*  Hang back.
*  No, this is, no, no, no, no, that was 2014.
*  This is on a, so watch this.
*  She passes right here.
*  This is a world championships going over this water, that girl in the
*  middle didn't go over good.
*  Emma did.
*  And right here.
*  So she's turning it on, but now it's, you know, now the finish line is there, but
*  see how controlled and like fluid she is.
*  And this is so fast.
*  God damn.
*  And so she went on that crazy run with you and Courtney as well.
*  No, no, no, no.
*  What was she doing?
*  They're two different athletes.
*  Um, no, she didn't run that.
*  Like she was sleeping up there with you guys, right?
*  No, no, no, no.
*  She crashed.
*  No, that was Maggie.
*  Oh, Maggie.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  She's, she's an ultra.
*  This is Emma Kobe.
*  Emma, Emma, Maggie.
*  Those are such white girl names.
*  I just conflate them all together in my head.
*  Yeah.
*  No, Emma lives in Crested Butte.
*  So I went, I met Courtney in Leadville and that's, um, we ran.
*  Uh, Mount Sherman, which is 14,000 feet.
*  So I met her at four in the afternoon, Courtney and her husband, Kevin.
*  And we did, uh, this big 11 mile loop and we did a 14,000 foot peak.
*  And then I stayed there, um, and at their house.
*  And then the next morning I got up and drove and met Emma in Crested Butte,
*  which is another small town in Colorado and it's high altitude.
*  And that's where, that's where Emma grew up and her parents live.
*  And so I met her there the next day and we ran, I don't know, shorter distance,
*  but she runs so much faster, you know, five miles or whatever.
*  But for me, we're only five miles at 10,000 feet with her at that pace.
*  It's like, I mean, she's got some length too.
*  Oh yeah.
*  How tall is she?
*  Uh, I would say five, seven, but her long, her legs are so long.
*  Yeah.
*  And she's running.
*  She's, she got that crazy long stride.
*  Yeah.
*  And running, she's run trails there at 10,000 or 9,000 feet.
*  And it's just like that training and to, to go over those
*  barriers, you have to be athletic.
*  Yeah.
*  Like, uh, it's a different explosive.
*  She's more athletic than say the girls from Kenya.
*  Right.
*  Smaller they, but they live Kenya's high elevation too.
*  So, but if Emma lives at the same elevation, has the same talent, um,
*  fastest mile ever run in Colorado soil running 432 points.
*  So that's, that's, that's the one I, that's the one I watched.
*  That's where I said she was in.
*  Yeah.
*  She was in at the back.
*  And then I said that decision you made to turn it on.
*  No, that's not it.
*  Oh.
*  Just a slow motion version of it.
*  Oh yeah.
*  I think this, yeah, this was a couple of years ago that she just,
*  she just broke that outside.
*  Oh, so this is the indoor version of it and then she broke it.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  But yeah, so I just was interested in how, how that decision is made.
*  Now, what, when you talk to her about her training, how much of her
*  training is just running and how much of her training is like strength
*  and conditioning, does she do plyometrics?
*  Cause she's got to not just run, she's got to jump over things.
*  Yeah.
*  She, she runs every day.
*  Usually I think she runs about 70 or 80 miles a week when she's training.
*  And so it'll be about, you know, 10 miles a day split up a couple
*  times and then she'll lift, I believe three times a week.
*  And so we lifted together too.
*  And it's just, you know, um, yeah, I mean, she's, she's strong.
*  Definitely.
*  Oh, you have to be.
*  Yeah.
*  You could see it in her legs, like in the fact that she's able to get over
*  those hurdles while she's in the middle of this crazy run.
*  Yeah.
*  Hello.
*  A four 30 mile fast.
*  There's something also so crazy about your goal in life.
*  Like what you do, the thing that you concentrate on the most is your physical
*  body, like you're banking on this.
*  You're banking on your tissue.
*  Who is humans?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Any human that does that, whether you're a fighter or a baseball player or a runner,
*  there's something crazy about banking on your body.
*  You know, like I always, when I look at professional athletes in particular, I'm
*  always like, Ooh, like, boy, anything can go wrong.
*  Like, and then it takes forever to fix.
*  It's not like you blow out a tire.
*  You go to the car shop and you, you know, you go to the tire place, you get a new tire.
*  That blow out a knee.
*  That's been the only secret to any success I've had is that longevity.
*  Yeah.
*  Because there's a lot of people who've been better than me for short span.
*  But if you can just keep doing it, keep grinding, keep grinding, keep hammering.
*  I don't care what it is.
*  You're going to get good.
*  Yeah.
*  That is the case.
*  What, how do you, how do you avoid injuries?
*  Because you train so much.
*  I don't, I mean, I get massage and, um, you do those Norma tech boots.
*  So yeah, I got those.
*  Yeah.
*  Thank you.
*  I sent you those.
*  You sent those to me.
*  Yeah.
*  Those things are the shit.
*  Yeah.
*  The, uh, hypervolt, the hammer with the ball on it that massage.
*  Yep.
*  Yeah.
*  Do that with, uh, Eric comes over about three times a week.
*  You know, you trained with Eric too and goes through, breaks down my hamstrings
*  and calves and, and, uh, hips, especially.
*  So, um, I had a lady that was giving me massage and, uh, I had a TheraGun and, uh,
*  I wound up just having her just use the TheraGun.
*  Like she was giving me massage.
*  Didn't, it was great and everything, but there was this like one spot in my back.
*  I was like, just try this for a second.
*  And that worked.
*  Yeah, man.
*  Like half the massage session was just her jackhammer me just working me with that.
*  And it was more effective than anything because you could do something with those
*  things where you can push all the weight in like a massage, but it's doing
*  something that you're not going to be able to do with your hands.
*  Right.
*  That there's a girl who does my massage.
*  Her name's Erin.
*  She is so amazing.
*  I mean, I can say something that's bothering me.
*  She can go like feel my leg or go right to it and just feel it.
*  She just knows where the knots are.
*  And then she'll do something else on some other side or some other place.
*  And it's like, I've never, I've had a lot of massages.
*  Definitely there's just like we say, there's levels to everything.
*  She's amazing.
*  I mean, some people just understand bodies.
*  They're intuitive.
*  Like they know where you're tight.
*  We have strain.
*  Like, did you pull your hamstring?
*  Did you do this?
*  Yeah.
*  Like, do you have something going on with your back?
*  Like, what do you mean?
*  Like this side is tight.
*  So it's probably, you're probably compensating for something that's on the other side.
*  Then.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  So the, I mean, the only way you're going to over, you know, 10, 20, 30 years to continue
*  to do it is for maintenance is taking care of your body.
*  Um, you say it is tissue.
*  It is muscle.
*  It is have joints and ligaments.
*  Um, if those, something happens with those, you're training.
*  Then you never even had any operations, have you?
*  That's bananas.
*  No, I've had a bunch.
*  I'm amazed.
*  Well, how do you, how are your knees?
*  Okay.
*  That's the other thing.
*  How the fuck are your knees?
*  Okay.
*  I don't know.
*  People ask me that all the time.
*  I was like, how do you answer that?
*  I mean, you, have you gotten an MRI?
*  You don't have any meniscus problems?
*  Nothing.
*  That's bananas.
*  No, I mean, it's my age.
*  Yeah.
*  You've been running forever.
*  You don't have any meniscus.
*  I have all fucked up meniscus.
*  But you also did a sport that was hard on your knees.
*  Yeah.
*  Right.
*  Running isn't.
*  I, you know, everybody's different.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, it's maybe I have good genetics.
*  Yeah.
*  You obviously must.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I was pretty good with my right knee until like, I heard it in a kicking contest with Joe Schilling.
*  I tore my meniscus.
*  Like a year ago, like a moron at the old studio.
*  Yeah.
*  Kicking that thing.
*  That machine we had, the registers, how hard you get.
*  Yeah.
*  You did it then with jeans on.
*  I remember seeing the video.
*  Yeah.
*  No, we're on 52 years old, slamming into that thing, a full clip as hard as I can.
*  Yeah.
*  But that, that's a problem with something shows you a number.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, I know.
*  It's a measure.
*  And you just wind up to wind up like that.
*  If I was coaching someone to say, stop, you got to warm up.
*  Let's jump rope.
*  Let's get a sweat.
*  Yeah.
*  Go on, stretch out a little bit.
*  Let's start slow.
*  Like when I work out on a normal day, I never, I don't just walk up to a heavy bag and full blast, start kicking it.
*  I build up.
*  But you haven't can't have a contest with Joe Schilling and say, hold on, let me warm up.
*  Exactly.
*  He's, he's too much of a hard man.
*  Yeah.
*  I had a, we had to step up.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And tear your knee.
*  Yeah.
*  My knee's still fucked up.
*  I mean, it's not fucked up to the point where I can't do things.
*  Like I can still kick.
*  Yeah.
*  I can still run.
*  I could still do all those things, but I feel it where I didn't use to feel it before.
*  But that's why I'm amazed that you don't have any of these kinds of injuries.
*  No, I don't know.
*  You had a, I remember you had a fucked up foot at one point in time.
*  Oh, I have a, I mean, there's injuries.
*  There's being heard and being injured.
*  You know, I heard all the time.
*  I heard every day, but I haven't been injured.
*  Hmm.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the difference.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, it's, I don't know.
*  Are you taking CBD at all?
*  Yeah, sometimes.
*  Dude, I was getting arthritis in my toes.
*  Yeah.
*  And did it help?
*  When my big toes, my big toes, like at the joint where my foot, my big toe, it was very
*  annoying and it's from kicking, you know, just from, cause you're always like pushing
*  off, pushing off, pushing off.
*  Yeah.
*  And my, my toes just got so tired of me doing that and they were getting sore.
*  And then I started doubling and tripling down on CBD, particularly like CBD
*  gummies.
*  That's my new trick.
*  Cause it's, it's like, I'm eating candy.
*  Oh, those CBD, MD gummies are like 1500 milligrams.
*  I just chuck like fucking 10 of them down at a time.
*  Do they have the THC in them?
*  No, no, no, zero, zero high at all.
*  But it killed it.
*  Like whatever, like I was like, God damn it.
*  Am I going to have to get some, I was thinking I was going to have to get PRP or
*  something done to my, my big toe.
*  And that helped it.
*  Killed it.
*  I don't have any problem with it at all.
*  Now it's whatever it was, it was gone away.
*  Dave Foley told me the same thing.
*  Dave Foley told me he was getting serious arthritis in his hands where his hands
*  were like this.
*  He couldn't open up his fingers, started taking CBD on a daily basis.
*  And then now his hands are fully functional, like whatever it was, he stopped in his
*  tracks.
*  It's just inflammation.
*  Yeah, right.
*  Yeah.
*  I saw, well, when Trump and Biden get here, you're going to do the DMT question,
*  right?
*  Oh, well, I'm going to get him high first.
*  Both of them are going to get high.
*  We're going to do mushrooms.
*  I'm going to bring in a shaman.
*  There was that Babylon Bee that I showed you today.
*  They did have a thing that said like Trump was on here for an epic seven hour
*  interview with Rogan and said had the best marijuana possibly he's ever had.
*  It was like tremendous or you know how Trump has these things.
*  But yeah, it was so funny.
*  Amazing, amazing pot.
*  Can you imagine getting that guy high?
*  I don't, he doesn't even drink.
*  Does he?
*  I don't think so.
*  Oh, this is it.
*  Yeah, see.
*  That's the picture.
*  That's what I'm saying.
*  That's the picture.
*  It's a great picture.
*  It is.
*  Well, what was it captioned?
*  Jamie, can you find that?
*  What did it say?
*  Oh my God.
*  It's hilarious.
*  Yeah.
*  Lively seven hour interview with Joe Rogan.
*  Imagine.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Not just how many votes he would win if he did that.
*  Well, I bet a lot.
*  I bet he'd lose a lot too.
*  Yeah.
*  He'd be like, what is happening?
*  You need some more of that?
*  I'll have a, I don't know.
*  What's more coffee?
*  There might be a little bit.
*  We can get some more.
*  Okay.
*  Put the order in.
*  Um, yeah, that guy, he's not, he's not taking anything, but perhaps a few
*  uppers to help with speeches.
*  You see with the, the Biden thing, he, um, Trump said he wanted to do a
*  drug test before debates.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  No.
*  What does he think Biden's on?
*  Oh, they got him hopped up on something.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  If you're that tired.
*  Yeah.
*  I guarantee you they're doing something with him.
*  He, him talking.
*  Oh my God.
*  It's just, it's painful.
*  I mean, it's like, I feel embarrassed.
*  Yeah.
*  That's sad.
*  It's sad.
*  And then there's the tremendous pressure that's involved in that job.
*  Yeah.
*  I couldn't imagine.
*  I mean, not being at your best.
*  No, that's what I've always, I mean, I've always been, I just don't get how
*  there's these people have been in politics for 50 years and I'm like, okay,
*  good job.
*  Thank you.
*  You did it.
*  You served whoever, but isn't there somebody better?
*  I mean, smarter, younger, like more energized.
*  Why do we have these 80 year old guys?
*  I don't know.
*  Oh, it doesn't make any sense.
*  I mean, there's got, there's gotta be people who are just like on the top of
*  their game.
*  You can't be at the top of your game in your 80.
*  You got to wonder like what it is, what it is with the powers that be that
*  decided to go with him.
*  Did they think that he's a known, a known name, a former vice president?
*  So that, that brings them to, but there was obviously some shenanigans because
*  they were really worried about Bernie Sanders taking the nomination.
*  They're really worried that he was going to enact some radical change to the
*  democratic party and they were not looking forward to that at all.
*  So, you know, they stepped in and got mayor Pete and Amy Klobuchar and all
*  those other people to back out and to back down.
*  And then all the delegates went to Biden and then Biden winds up being the guy.
*  And you almost feel bad for the guy.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, that can't be our best option for running.
*  I mean, so whoever wins, you want to feel confident.
*  Yeah.
*  And I know people on the other side of where I, I am, don't feel confident.
*  I think they're banking on Harris.
*  They're banking on people saying, well, she's young and healthy.
*  She'll take over.
*  She is young.
*  I mean, so it goes to that point of being young and, you know, energetic, but, um,
*  yeah, I mean, she's kept a lot of people in jail.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know.
*  I, I, man, politics.
*  What a mess.
*  It's gross.
*  It's gross.
*  And I don't know what the best way to do it is.
*  You know, I think our founding fathers had some pretty brilliant ideas.
*  How were they so dialed in so long ago?
*  It's amazing to know they write this constitution, not to protect, not to
*  protect the government from the people, the people from the government, from,
*  from, oh, overstepping.
*  How did they know?
*  I mean, maybe because it was the king and queen.
*  And yeah, I think they saw just, I mean, people had an understanding of
*  psychology back then of just human beings and just the natural tendency of
*  people to abuse power and to use influence.
*  And I think they just came out with a really brilliant way to sort of have
*  checks and balances to keep that from getting completely out of hand.
*  Yeah.
*  It's amazing.
*  It really is amazing if you stop and think about that, you know,
*  and how old this, um, there's this, um, young man, Madison Cawthorn.
*  He has, I think he's like the, I don't know.
*  I can't remember what seat he won, but one of the youngest ever.
*  When an election, I think it's in North Carolina, but he mentioned
*  something about the age of, um, man who was Jefferson.
*  Yeah.
*  Like how old were they?
*  Well, you people didn't live that long.
*  They got like toothaches and died.
*  Right.
*  Well, was it, were they in their twenties?
*  I wonder, let's, let's, uh, Google how old was Thomas Jefferson when he drafted
*  the declaration of independence?
*  How old do you think he is?
*  It's close to 40, I believe.
*  Close to 40.
*  Still pretty amazing.
*  Yeah.
*  Or maybe, you know, maybe.
*  What if you go back and you actually look at him and he looks
*  exactly like Jared Kushner.
*  Everybody does.
*  It's him.
*  Wait, hold on a second.
*  Uh, an age in 1776, Thomas Jefferson was 33.
*  Wow.
*  So young.
*  And fucking smart as shit.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I think some of the guys were in their twenties.
*  40, 53, 46, 39, 35, 70 years old.
*  Who's seven?
*  Five, uh, Benjamin Franklin.
*  Wow.
*  He had to be eating wild game meat.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  So 30 year old.
*  Well, he got electrocuted a bunch of times, right?
*  26.
*  He had a kite.
*  26 year old lawyer.
*  Who was 26?
*  Jared Kushner.
*  Thomas Lynch Jr.
*  From South Carolina.
*  Okay.
*  See, I mean three years later, three years.
*  Yeah.
*  The stress of coming up with that fucking information.
*  26 year old from South Carolina, lawyer plantation owner.
*  No, he had COVID.
*  No, Edward Rutledge.
*  Wow.
*  That's it.
*  You have two.
*  They're counting his death as COVID guaranteed.
*  Yeah.
*  It is really amazing at how smart they were.
*  Yeah.
*  But you know, when you read like, uh, letters from like the Civil War era, if
*  you read letters back home, like the way people wrote back then was so eloquent.
*  Yeah.
*  At least the ones that you obviously, there's probably morons that wrote
*  some fucking scribbles too.
*  Yeah.
*  But there were, there were some letters that were written back then where the
*  prose is so, it's so elegant.
*  It's so well written.
*  So, so beautifully crafted these, these letters that they would write.
*  I know you get to read them.
*  You go, well, what, what has happened between then and now?
*  I'd like to get letters like that.
*  I mean, you'd feel special if you had a letter like that.
*  God, I know.
*  The way they communicated back then was just different.
*  Do you think people would have spiced up how they wrote just in case someone, they
*  know it wasn't going to be personal correspondence.
*  They want, wouldn't want people to think they're dumb.
*  So they add in some, they'd like,
*  but the problem is when a dummy writes things and tries to make them seem smart.
*  Have you ever gotten an email from someone that's dumb?
*  That tries to be smart.
*  Just would have someone else write it for them back then.
*  Like, Hey, I can't write this, but write a letter to my girlfriend, make it sound
*  good, tell her I miss her, send it off.
*  Perhaps.
*  I'm just kind of wondering, cause people do that now.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, they do.
*  They have ghost writers on it back then.
*  They're a little more, we're a little more diabolical now though.
*  I wonder if there was like a market for ghost writers back then for letters back home.
*  Had to be, cause there's only so many people that could write.
*  I don't know about that.
*  I don't know.
*  I'm just saying, or even the access to the tools to write and feather to make it look good.
*  I wonder.
*  Yeah.
*  Paper.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know.
*  Just wonder.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, I think people were, it was a harder time and during harder times,
*  people are more disciplined and people that are more disciplined probably are more,
*  they're harder on their children about learning and grades.
*  This probably wasn't so flippant because it's like the consequences of not succeeding
*  in life back then were literal starvation.
*  It was, it was a different time.
*  And I think when you, you have those consequences, you have, you develop stronger
*  people, you develop people with, they just, they don't have any room for error.
*  There's no, you can't, you can't fuck off.
*  No.
*  You won't make it.
*  No.
*  I know it's a, yeah.
*  Pretty amazing to think that we're still going by the doctrine they came up with.
*  Amazing.
*  You know, and it's the best one we have.
*  Like no one's come up with a better.
*  Where is your pocket?
*  Didn't Tim Kennedy give you a pocket?
*  It's at home.
*  I have it framed.
*  You don't have it with you?
*  No, it's what it's in my pocket.
*  It's going to get like gum on it and shit.
*  You need to reference it.
*  It'll get scratched up.
*  A pen will leak on it.
*  I can't have that.
*  Okay.
*  I needed it at home.
*  I thought that was a good gift and he gave you a gun.
*  That's cool.
*  Yeah.
*  Jamie's been shooting everybody.
*  That's all he does now.
*  Well, that's what people with guns do.
*  That's what I've been hearing.
*  This is Joe Biden's going to put a stop to that.
*  Oh my God.
*  Well, I was watching some video where he was talking about making gun manufacturers
*  responsible for shootings.
*  It was the weirdest analogy that he was drawing.
*  And then he went on and erroneously said that guns kill 150 million people a year.
*  And I was like, what?
*  Yeah.
*  That's all.
*  Or 150 million people since a certain amount of time.
*  That doesn't make any sense at all.
*  But the thing that he was saying was that imagine if drug companies weren't
*  responsible for people dying of drugs.
*  Well, hey, Joe, they're not.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know if you know that, but they're not.
*  I mean, do you know how many people die every year from drug overdoses?
*  I don't.
*  How many?
*  A lot.
*  How many people are going to jail for that?
*  Yeah.
*  Is there any?
*  Nobody.
*  Are these drug companies really responsible for that?
*  Are they really being held accountable?
*  Yeah.
*  I don't think they are.
*  Maybe occasionally.
*  Maybe the street dealers going to jail.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, occasionally drug companies get in trouble for opioid deaths or for
*  misrepresenting the dangers of the addictions to opioids or some of their
*  drugs.
*  That's true.
*  Sometimes they get fined and they get in trouble.
*  But what he was saying was really weird.
*  It's like people say things just because they think that people want to hear
*  solutions like, hey, there's all these guns and shooting.
*  Someone better do something.
*  And then someone will come along and say something like that.
*  Like guns are responsible for 150 million people every year.
*  And here's what I'm going to do.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I know.
*  Do you remember when he got confronted by that guy at a auto factory?
*  Yeah.
*  Doing that.
*  Yeah.
*  And the guy was like, you're trying to take away guns.
*  You're full of shit.
*  Yeah.
*  You cussed him out.
*  You got old grandpa on him.
*  Well, that's a problem with, you know, how, so when you get old, you know, I'm
*  not, I don't want to talk shit about old people, but you can't think, you're
*  just not at your best.
*  So what happens, what I see, and maybe he has dementia, maybe not, but those
*  guys get, they're cranky.
*  They get mad.
*  They can't think of what they want to say fast enough.
*  So instead they just get mad.
*  Yeah.
*  And that's what it seems like he does.
*  Yeah.
*  He like lashes out and comes up.
*  You're full of shit.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I think you also-
*  Dog face pony soldier.
*  Did you see that one?
*  Yeah, that was a good one too.
*  What is, I don't even know what that is.
*  You're a lion dog face pony soldier.
*  That's a great thing to say to someone.
*  If I, this is the first time I've ever heard it.
*  It should be a good band.
*  Yeah.
*  Dog face pony soldier.
*  That would be a good band.
*  Good name for a band.
*  Like a weird funk band.
*  Yeah.
*  Dog face pony soldier.
*  I like it.
*  Yeah.
*  I could see them in Coachella.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a thing that, you know, when he gets mad like that too, it's almost like, it's
*  a tough guy thing too.
*  It's like, he's around all these hard men that are working in the factory and he's
*  like, you're a full of shit.
*  I'll show you guys.
*  I'm a fucking man.
*  It reminded me of Floyd Mayweather and he knocked out Victor Ortiz when they were
*  kissing or whatever they did, but Jim Gray.
*  Well, Victor Ortiz head butted them.
*  I know, but then they made up.
*  No, Victor Ortiz went to make up with Floyd Mayweather.
*  They did.
*  Floyd Mayweather was like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Okay.
*  Boom.
*  Yeah.
*  But it wasn't Jim Gray.
*  It was, it was an older, God, what's his name?
*  Larry Merchant.
*  Yes.
*  Larry Merchant.
*  Larry Merchant said that if he was 50 years younger, he'd kick Floyd's ass.
*  Oh, I remember that.
*  Yeah.
*  I was like, okay.
*  No, you wouldn't have.
*  No, you wouldn't have.
*  But it reminded me of he got mad and then he was just going to kick his ass.
*  But what a crazy thing to say to literally one of the greatest boxers
*  that's ever put on gloves.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, you can make an argument who the greatest boxer of all time is, but you
*  better have Floyd Mayweather in that argument.
*  He's going to be in there.
*  He's in that argument.
*  Probably if you're holding a microphone, you probably weren't ever going to kick
*  his ass.
*  No.
*  What's up with the Mayweather fighting Logan Paul?
*  You see him in some shorts?
*  Yes.
*  Well, Logan Paul wants to make some money.
*  I got Logan Paul in that fight.
*  Well, one thing I will tell you, Logan Paul is a really good athlete and he's
*  an enormous man.
*  Now, if it was an MMA fight, I would pick Logan Paul.
*  Well, Logan...
*  Listen to me.
*  There's a video of Logan Paul wrestling with Paul Ocosta.
*  It's a real live wrestling, like live wrestling sparring session where he is
*  exhibiting real skill.
*  He knows how to scramble.
*  He's got real wrestling skill.
*  And I know he wrestled in college.
*  I think he wrestled in college as well.
*  Oh, did he?
*  Okay.
*  No, didn't.
*  Just in high school.
*  But he was good though, right?
*  Did he go to college?
*  He went to OU.
*  And he didn't wrestle?
*  The biggest party school in the country.
*  I just partied.
*  So he's from Ohio, right?
*  That's why you know Ohio.
*  That's why I know.
*  Yeah.
*  He knows everything about Ohio.
*  How good was he in high school?
*  I remember hearing...
*  I don't know if he won state, but I'll check that real quick.
*  Either way, him with Paul Ocosta.
*  Paul O is the UFC's number one contender in the middleweight division.
*  And the most beautiful man in the UFC.
*  Perfect specimen of a man and a wrecking machine.
*  Yeah.
*  Just a fucking wrecking machine.
*  And the two of those guys are, they're doing a wrestling drill and sparring and
*  Logan Paul is hanging in there, man, with an elite MMA, you know, world
*  championship caliber fighter, a guy who like went to war with Yoel Romero and
*  walked him down.
*  Right.
*  I mean, Paul Ocosta is a monster.
*  Yeah.
*  He's a monster.
*  And Logan Paul is hanging in there.
*  And I don't care what anybody says.
*  Like what I saw in that, I'm like, that kid is impressive.
*  No, he's got to be 6'1".
*  He might actually did.
*  Let's see, he joined the wrestling team.
*  This says Ohio State in Athens, which is not just OU.
*  So he might've joined the team.
*  I don't know if he, I don't know if he had a record, if he performed with them or
*  if he just...
*  Okay.
*  So he did a little bit of wrestling in college, but he wrestled in high school as
*  well.
*  Yeah.
*  Either way.
*  He's a big dude.
*  He's a big dude and he's a real athlete.
*  And one of the things that I saw, you know, I know he lost his boxing match.
*  They had a draw the first time that he lost the second time.
*  But when I'm seeing him throw punches, like he's very athletic.
*  He throws punches with good technique, you know, but obviously the other kid
*  that he boxed with did as well.
*  But there's such a difference between that and Floyd Mayweather in a boxing match.
*  It's going to be hilarious.
*  Yeah.
*  The only thing is that Floyd is so much smaller than him.
*  Yeah.
*  He's got to be compared to Logan, tiny.
*  That's why I say I got the one punch Logan KO.
*  Oh my God.
*  That's so hilarious.
*  Could you imagine if he did?
*  Could you imagine if he clips Floyd Mayweather in a temple and to see Floyd
*  Mayweather do a chicken dance?
*  Imagine what the crowd would do.
*  Imagine what anybody would do.
*  Would be a crowd.
*  Yeah.
*  But I mean, I wonder when they're going to be able to have it.
*  Let's do it in China or some shit.
*  Yeah.
*  Fuck it.
*  I don't know.
*  I'm just pretty impressed with how Logan Paul has for a young kid has made so much
*  money and turn these, these opportunities to fight, fight Floyd.
*  What?
*  I know.
*  But the thing about it is like, who's going to sanction that?
*  The weight classes are so different.
*  Yeah.
*  Floyd is 50 pounds different.
*  It could be 50 pounds plus.
*  Yeah.
*  It could be more.
*  I don't, I don't think Floyd's walks around at more than 155 pounds.
*  Probably not.
*  Maybe 160 at the most.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, and when he's in shape, you know, less than that probably.
*  But here's the crazy thing.
*  I'll watch the shit out of that.
*  I'll watch it out of it too.
*  I mean, everybody will.
*  What were you talking about?
*  Mike Tyson versus Roy Jones Jr.
*  Yeah.
*  Like a lot of people are like, what, what are we doing?
*  What is happening here?
*  Yeah.
*  I like the fact that they decided not to do it September 12th.
*  So it already would have happened.
*  Yeah.
*  They decided to extend it deep into November, give everybody a chance to like really train
*  and ramp up the promotion and let everybody know.
*  And, and it's more and more exciting every day.
*  Roy Jones Jr.
*  Was posting some shit on his Instagram.
*  Yeah.
*  Dude, he's still got some hands.
*  Right.
*  Dude, he's still got some hand speed.
*  Yeah.
*  See if you can find that.
*  And he's coming in here soon.
*  So I was looking for Logan Paul wrestling coast and all I'm finding them is like place
*  barring.
*  Yeah, there's a little bit of boxing place barring, but there's a bunch of wrestling
*  scrambling in there.
*  That's really impressive.
*  Not in the video I saw.
*  And it's on his vlog.
*  I know, I know I'm looking.
*  Do you have to do another retraction?
*  No, no, I'm just looking like I may have to.
*  I apologize.
*  I lied about Logan Paul wrestling.
*  Just doing it in advance.
*  That fight for everything.
*  Yeah.
*  Just in case that fight is going to be one of the most ridiculous things ever.
*  Though, if you can get a YouTube star to to box the literal best boxer of all time,
*  never lost.
*  Yeah.
*  15.0.
*  So yeah, but back it up before that.
*  Yeah.
*  Let him let him scramble the jujitsu train.
*  Okay.
*  So this is just jujitsu training.
*  They're rolling around the mat, but they do some scrambles.
*  See, I don't know how much Logan is training.
*  But watch the wrestling.
*  Watch this though.
*  Seriously.
*  The kid can wrestle.
*  Like, come on, they're not showing it.
*  What kind of horse shit is this?
*  Is this because they want them to look good?
*  I don't know.
*  Oh, God damn it.
*  I know it's there.
*  Hey, what about the foot?
*  Oh, no.
*  What do we got?
*  Come on.
*  Show me some shit.
*  That's it.
*  Well, it exists.
*  It's somewhere.
*  So they did a lot of sparring, like boxing sparring for sure.
*  Yeah.
*  This is just showing.
*  Let it go right here.
*  Let's see what happens here.
*  Come on, Logan.
*  Show me some wrestling, bro.
*  It's amazing that Paul Carlson can make 185 pounds.
*  That's what's amazing.
*  The dude walks around at 230 and he's a tank.
*  I mean, yeah, he could be a heavyweight.
*  230?
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  At least they're close.
*  Similar.
*  Is he 62?
*  I swear it's real.
*  I swear it's not like the Antifa guy's lighting fires in Portland.
*  It's real.
*  They did the getting arrested part.
*  Maybe I'll find it.
*  Yeah.
*  No, I won't do that.
*  There's videos of him wrestling from like high school.
*  Oh, no, there's no videos of him wrestling Paulo Costa.
*  That video right there is the best I could find.
*  I'm looking at harder.
*  Son of a bitch.
*  Jamie, come on.
*  Jamie's punishing me for the Portland thing.
*  There's this video of him saying it's getting knocked out, but that's 100% staged.
*  Yeah, that's 100% fake.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, he's smart.
*  He's getting a lot of attention.
*  I just think he's going to be whiffing at air.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  How would you ever hit Floyd?
*  But if that one connects, that's what I got my money on.
*  That would be so bananas.
*  I know.
*  Imagine if Floyd goes because Logan's jacked, dude, because he gets KO'd by Logan Paul.
*  He's jacked.
*  I mean, he works out hard.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Super nice kid, too.
*  He's training with Shannon the Cannon Briggs.
*  Is he Shannon the Cannon?
*  At least he was before that last fight that he did.
*  Yeah.
*  Shannon the Cannon was training with him.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, and he he hunts.
*  So that's good.
*  Does he?
*  Yeah.
*  Where's he hunt?
*  He hunted in Ohio before.
*  What do you like? White tail?
*  Yeah.
*  His dad, because I went and did his podcast, took him a bow and and we shot.
*  And yeah, I mean, people got upset that you did his podcast.
*  Hunters. Yeah.
*  That's weird.
*  The hunting industry is that's weird.
*  First of all, for a lot of people that there's a hunting industry.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  There is because that's what social media has done.
*  It's created. That's why I'm here.
*  Him and his brother.
*  And I think the dad Chang hunting stories.
*  Yeah. Oh, interesting.
*  You could find that you can't find the fucking wrestling footage.
*  Yeah. I see. I see.
*  Not. Oh, I see.
*  It's not how it works.
*  I get it.
*  Yeah. Well, who's going to win Tyson Jones?
*  I do not want to say because I do not know.
*  But see if you can.
*  See if you can find Roy Jones, Jr.
*  training footage and then just put up some new stuff, I think, yesterday
*  or the day before, that's pretty legit.
*  And then, you know, we're going to get
*  we're going to get Tyson Logan Paul.
*  Oh, my God. That would be a murder.
*  Murder scene.
*  So three days ago, I think.
*  He still got hand speed. Yeah.
*  But he's still got the same style, like hands down. Yeah.
*  Look, dude, he looks fast as fuck.
*  Yeah, he does.
*  Yeah. I mean, I wonder what he's going to weigh.
*  I mean, God damn, dude. Yeah.
*  His hand speed is phenomenal. Yeah.
*  That's how we look at that.
*  His thing has been speed, right?
*  Not just hand speed, but foot speed as well.
*  Roy has always been.
*  He's had he had a weird style when he was young,
*  which is one of the reasons why when he slowed down,
*  it was very difficult for him to be successful because Roy would
*  instead of jab people, he would leap in with a left hook. Yeah.
*  He had a crazy left hook like a like a hook.
*  Kind of like a weird hook.
*  Mm hmm. Yeah.
*  And he used that in lieu of a jab sometimes, like a lot of times.
*  And he did crazy shit, like put his hands behind his back
*  and then knock people out.
*  He was so good when he was young.
*  People like that song he made, y'all must have forgot.
*  Yeah. A lot of people did forget.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  I remember, man, when I was a, you know, younger man
*  and Roy Jones Jr. was in his prime, you would just see
*  who's getting executed this week. Yeah.
*  You know, and he one time he had a fight the day he had a full basketball game.
*  So he had a full basketball game played like he played like semi pro basketball.
*  And then after the basketball game, had a fight. Wow.
*  And won the fight.
*  People like this is disrespectful.
*  Like this is the Roy Jones Jr. highlight.
*  I mean, come on, son. He was so fast.
*  Look at this.
*  That fight with Vinny Pazienza.
*  That was the only fight that CompuBox ever scored
*  where there was no punches landed on Roy for an entire round.
*  Really? Yeah.
*  He had a weird body, man. God, look at that. Incredible.
*  But look how weird his body is like.
*  He has enormous biceps like his biceps were huge, but he didn't have big triceps.
*  Oh, he had a really unusual build.
*  But his biceps, bro, his biceps are bananas.
*  They're bananas.
*  And he had just preposterous speed and timing and confidence.
*  That would hurt so bad. Right. Yeah.
*  Look at this guy.
*  Oh, he lit people on fire and pissed on their graves.
*  He was on just incredible.
*  That would be, you know, a terrible would be to fight somebody like that.
*  Oh, man.
*  Well, in his prime, he was so much better than everybody he was fighting.
*  It was just this weird.
*  And people were like, oh, Roy didn't fight anyone good.
*  Like, incorrect. Yeah. They were good.
*  They just weren't Roy Jones, Jr.
*  Roy Jones, Jr. was on a totally different level for years.
*  The thing is, like a fighter can only maintain that kind of RP
*  and that fucking RPMs that he was at.
*  You can only maintain that for a certain amount of time.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  You know, Fador did it for a long time.
*  Anderson Silva did it for a long time.
*  The guys are like at the very, very best.
*  They can only hold on to it for a certain amount of years.
*  Yeah. And then the knees go, the back goes, the joints go, the hands break.
*  Things just, you know.
*  Yeah. But isn't that kind of conventional wisdom that the power can stay, though?
*  Oh, yeah. So that's what like with Tyson.
*  I mean, he looks fast there. I'll say Jones looks fast.
*  I found it for you. Oh, here it is. Oh, look at this.
*  Look at that. Look at this.
*  Deep on Reddit. Yeah. But dude, but look at the scrambles, man.
*  The kid can fucking wrestle like seriously legit. Oh, man.
*  Look at these scrambles like watch this.
*  See that turn around that duck under. Look at this.
*  And Paulo Costa is a beast.
*  She's just the scramble, the way spinning around and avoiding the take down.
*  That's athletic. Yes. Very.
*  Thank you, Jamie. OK. Thank you.
*  I knew it was retract.
*  Now find me some Antifa guys like forest fires and we're good.
*  He's he's a real athlete. Yeah.
*  And he's a big kid. Yeah. Yeah.
*  But point made. That was impressive.
*  Very impressive. So it was an MMA fight. Floyd would be fucked.
*  Yeah. He would get takedown smashed for sure.
*  100 percent bet the house. Yeah.
*  But it's not an MMA fight.
*  It's a boxing match and Floyd is the best of all time.
*  One punch. Good luck.
*  One punch. Get out of here with that shit.
*  I just wonder if Roy Jones Jr.
*  is going to be able to avoid Mike Tyson's the bum rush. Yeah.
*  Avoid that that style of that marauding attacking style,
*  because obviously when you see the Tyson training footage,
*  he's still got that speed. Yeah.
*  He's still got that power. He hits those mitts.
*  It's still terrifying. Yeah.
*  I don't. I just I don't want to see him get
*  get hit by those Tyson hooks.
*  If it's going to be I mean, if that happens,
*  it'll be in the first minute or two.
*  And the weird thing is, like some people are saying that it's not a fight.
*  They're like saying, well, it's just going to be a sparring match.
*  Like you can tell that to Tyson, because no, I'll tell the story
*  that I was telling you. Yeah. This new studio.
*  There's a certain distance.
*  This this table is a certain width.
*  And this is the exact same with.
*  I don't remember what it is.
*  I don't remember how many inches it is.
*  But this is the exact same with the old table, the old studio. Yeah.
*  But when we moved to this new place, I'm like, maybe it'd be better
*  for like a little more intimate.
*  I have a table with that's like a little smaller.
*  And then I did the interview with Tyson. Yeah.
*  And he was so see, I had two interviews with Tyson, one from like 11 months ago
*  or 10 months ago, where he was like smoking weed.
*  He's opening a ranch. He's got this weed ranch.
*  He's like super chill and he's introspective and philosophical.
*  And he's talking about his past and all his mistakes
*  and how weed makes him a nicer person.
*  And he likes himself on weed.
*  And you felt comfortable at that distance. Oh, my God. Right.
*  It was perfect conversation. I really enjoyed it.
*  And then the next time was when he's fit and I mean, slim down to.
*  You know, these weird muscles that you have at the top of your form.
*  Like he had a golf ball shoved under his skin.
*  He just checked. Yeah. And ready to go.
*  Mindset. He felt different to be around, man.
*  He was so keyed up.
*  I mean, he's in the middle of training camp. Yeah.
*  And and he was just super intense, different person.
*  And then we started talking about how it felt orgasmic to hurt people sometimes.
*  And I'm like, I think I need a wider table.
*  And Trump sent that out.
*  Yeah. Trump put that on his Twitter with
*  no comment, no context, just posted that about Mike Tyson.
*  He thought it was interesting. But what?
*  How can what? Imagine.
*  Imagine you're the leader of the free world. Yeah.
*  And you go post and shit about how it feels like you want to come
*  when you're you're beating people up.
*  You make sense.
*  And it's Mike Tyson talking about it, too. And he's like, I like it.
*  Yeah. I'm going to repost this. Yeah. Yeah.
*  But so that made me decide to widen this table
*  because if I was a little closer to him, so we were like this close,
*  I might be nervous. It might affect my ability to do the conversation.
*  Couple inches. Yes. Yeah.
*  Was it six extra inches, Jamie, that we widen the table?
*  Yeah. Directly because of Mike Tyson interview.
*  I was like, Yikes.
*  So yeah. So he's I think they call that the eye of the tiger.
*  Yeah. Oh, yeah. The eye of the tiger. He's ready.
*  He's ready. Oh, man.
*  But the thing is, like,
*  what what happens if Roy can move away from him?
*  What happens if Roy could avoid avoid the attack?
*  And how are they going to treat this?
*  Are they are they going to treat it like a sparring session
*  or are they going to treat it like war?
*  That's what originally the reports were saying.
*  It was not going to be a full out fight.
*  But I don't if Tyson's looking that intimidation, intimidating.
*  Can he scale it back?
*  I don't even think he knows what that means.
*  What does that mean? I don't know.
*  I just I can't imagine he's going to scale it back.
*  Yeah. And Roy Jones Jr.
*  was saying something recently.
*  He thinks he might have made a mistake.
*  Yeah, I would think that, too.
*  Yeah. But I don't know if he's being serious.
*  He probably watched the interview with Tyson 11 months ago
*  and thought that, oh, I'll fight this guy.
*  This guy's cool.
*  If you watch this recent one, that's when he thought,
*  I think I made a mistake. Maybe.
*  But the fact that he would say that, I can't imagine he's being serious.
*  Or unless he wants to make a lot of money.
*  And he's like, you know, this is the way it'll make.
*  Isn't it crazy how Tyson he's can make money for?
*  How long has it been?
*  You know, is 85 is when he first broke in.
*  So how many years is this?
*  I mean, it's been it's been a while and he's still Tyson.
*  I think the last time he fought was in the
*  I want to say the early 2000s, like 2005, maybe.
*  I can't. I just know when he first came up is like 85.
*  Because I was I think I was a junior or senior or something like that.
*  But yeah, 35 years ago.
*  I remember when he was on the cover of Sports Illustrated,
*  he was 19 years old, said Kid Dynamite.
*  Yeah. And it was him at 19.
*  I know the most exciting heavyweight prospect.
*  Yeah. And Tyson would fight.
*  It was an event. It was an execution.
*  Yeah. You'd watch people get executed.
*  Yeah. I remember I watched the fight
*  where he lost to Buster Douglas after I knew the result.
*  Oh, and I still didn't believe it.
*  I was like, he's going to get up. He's going to knock him out.
*  Like, this is yeah, this is Mike Tyson. He can't lose.
*  I was at some duplex.
*  And I remember him when he was on his hands and knees looking for his mouthpiece.
*  I was like, what is going on?
*  The world has gone crazy. It's gone haywire.
*  Yeah, it didn't seem real.
*  No, that was crazy.
*  No, he I can't imagine he's going to dial it back.
*  What do we see if you could find Roy's exact statement
*  when he said he thinks he made a mistake?
*  Because that to me is like, huh.
*  Or is he selling it? Right.
*  Is he selling it? Yeah.
*  Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. Roy's smart.
*  He's a great commentator.
*  He's one of the best commentators in the game.
*  I met him one time. Me, you, him. Yeah.
*  And in Vegas, after fights, we were eating steak. Yeah.
*  Yeah, that was I think that was at Mandalay Bay.
*  Is that the place that steakhouse we always go?
*  That's the one the MGM is out.
*  Did we eat there?
*  I think we ate the one at Mandalay Bay, if I remember correctly. Yeah.
*  But
*  but he's been fighting much more recently.
*  Roy Jones on Mike Tyson exhibition match.
*  I made a mistake going in with him.
*  Tyson is still one of the strongest, most explosive people
*  who ever touched a boxing glove.
*  Jones said.
*  We even got Biden's performance for that.
*  What does it say here?
*  He's still Mike Tyson, still one of the strongest, most explosive people
*  who ever touched a box of if anything, I made a mistake going in with him.
*  He's the bigger guy. He's the explosive guy.
*  He said he's going to have all the first round fireworks, not me.
*  I do have first round fireworks,
*  but he's known for more first round fireworks than anybody to ever touch
*  boxing other than maybe George Foreman.
*  Jones apprehension follows remarks Tyson made last month
*  where he called the match a search and destroy.
*  Oh, Jesus Christ.
*  Oh, Jesus Christ.
*  You imagine you're at home.
*  Look, I'm just going to check Twitter before I go to bed.
*  Yeah, you see that.
*  Search and destroy.
*  Tyson says this is search and destroy, and I'm looking forward
*  to recapturing my glory.
*  Tyson told TMZ Sports the fighting game is what I'm about
*  and hurting people is what I'm about. Oh, my God. Yeah.
*  It's so interesting for me to see like Jamie and I talked about it
*  right after Tyson left. Yeah.
*  Jamie was like, OK, that was a different person.
*  Like from that from 11 months ago, you mean? Yeah.
*  Everything, everything.
*  They were ready to fight back then.
*  And then all of a sudden, yeah. Yeah.
*  He was. Yeah.
*  Everything you've just been saying last five minutes.
*  He was saying to us during the podcast the first time,
*  he's like, I don't even work out.
*  He goes, if I work out, I'll reignite my ego.
*  He goes, I don't I don't remember that. Yes.
*  And then one of the quotes he said in this comeback,
*  he said the gods of war have reignited my ego.
*  The gods of war.
*  What a fucking terrifying human.
*  What I remember is seeing some of those clips of him
*  punching lately with all that power is his legs. Yeah.
*  I mean, you know, that's where the power.
*  I saw his his quads or his hamstring, just the size of his legs.
*  My God, that's a thick kid. Yeah.
*  Brendan Schaub thick. He's still got it.
*  He's still got it. Whatever it is, it's crazy. Yeah.
*  Yeah. He's still got it.
*  Well, I don't know.
*  Should be fun to watch.
*  There's a thing about like having that skill when you're young.
*  As long as the body doesn't fall apart, as long as the shoulders
*  still work right and the back's not completely blown out, like
*  especially if and I don't know what the deal is with TRT
*  and growth hormone and all that stuff.
*  But if he still if he knows how to move his body
*  and he learned how to move his body in a way very few human beings can do
*  the way he he has that that shell, that that guard where he comes in
*  that peekaboo style, just bobbing and weaving, throwing fucking bombs.
*  Like that is in his makeup.
*  Well, it's like you kicking. Yeah.
*  It's like you with your your spinning back. Yeah.
*  All that shit. Yeah.
*  It's like you've done it since you were 15.
*  Yeah. So he's done the same thing. Exactly.
*  So no matter what your body does, if you're stronger
*  because the TRT or whatever else, that's that technique isn't going anywhere.
*  Yeah. Your mind still knows how to do it.
*  I remember there was a video.
*  Look at this. Mike Tyson gets more rep with each intense training video.
*  Dude, this is a while ago, though.
*  This is a while ago. He's way more jacked than this now.
*  Yeah. That's what's crazy.
*  Like he this was months and months and months ago.
*  So this is September.
*  OK, so here we go.
*  I saw this video.
*  So I was trying to help. Oh, sons. Oh, here it goes.
*  Oh, this is just a bunch of this one.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  So this is where I saw it. Look at his legs, dude. Yeah.
*  No, he's exploding.
*  And it's also he's an unstoppable force.
*  It's he's an unstoppable force.
*  Still got it.
*  Yeah. It's the thing about him is you got to stop him from coming.
*  And you can't. Yeah.
*  Do you ever see the most terrifying Mike Tyson fight for me is Marvis Frazier.
*  Do you ever see that fight? I'm sure I did.
*  Marvis Frazier, who is Joe Frazier's son. Yeah.
*  And there was all this shit talk. Right.
*  Up to this fight where Joe Frazier was like, my son's going to fuck you up.
*  And yeah. OK.
*  You know, and there was this intensity because, you know, a lot of people
*  had kind of compared Tyson in many ways to Frazier because they were more
*  fairly short, heavyweights.
*  Both had that sort of bobbing and weaving style.
*  Look how intense that is.
*  And the guy who's training him is Rafael Cordero, who's a that's
*  King's MMA in Huntington Beach.
*  Rafael Cordero is a legendary MMA coach,
*  which is really interesting that he's the guy who's training Mike Tyson, because.
*  Well, see that quote right there?
*  Look inside my soul and how bad I want it.
*  If Tyson's like, look inside.
*  You don't want that. Look at his forearm.
*  See that what I'm talking about? Yeah.
*  Muscles on his forearm. Yeah. Bro.
*  When he said that's that muscle is from this.
*  That's from clenching and smashing.
*  Yeah. Or you're doing chin ups and shit.
*  But that's like the fist muscle.
*  Yeah, dude. Fucking terrifying.
*  He's so terrifying.
*  But Rafael Cordero, the guy who's training, which is really interesting,
*  he's not necessarily known as a boxing trainer.
*  He's a Muay Thai trainer.
*  Obviously trained Anderson Silva, trained
*  a lot of the Curitiba guys, the shoot the box guys,
*  like Mauricio Shogun, who are ninja, who are like
*  Vandale Silva, some of the like the all time great MMA legends of the pioneers.
*  He was one of the trainers for those guys, like main trainer for a lot of those guys.
*  I wonder why he went with him.
*  I think they just started out hitting paths together.
*  Oh, you know, and I think he just likes the guy and they started hitting
*  pass, he likes what he was bringing to the table.
*  And yeah, I always wonder what would happen if
*  was it cuss?
*  Custom on if he wouldn't have died.
*  Oh, yeah. You know, different world.
*  I mean, because that's what kind of got Tyson.
*  Then he was with Don King and that whole thing and unhealthy lifestyle.
*  But when he was with custom, I was like, it was just,
*  you know, singular vision of.
*  Yeah, he probably would have been even greater than he was.
*  Yeah, he probably would have maintained it much longer than he was that he did.
*  Yeah, I mean, because probably would have kept him up in the cat's
*  gills, pulled him away from all the bullshit.
*  That's what I'm thinking.
*  Yeah, well, he just we talked about it a bit.
*  But what an amazing father figure cuss was.
*  But we also talked about how cuss hypnotized him.
*  Really? Oh, yeah, man.
*  When he was young, cuss hypnotized him.
*  And that was part of his ability to like seek and destroy
*  is that cuss told him things like you don't exist.
*  Just the task, the task exists.
*  You know, that there's a man in front of you.
*  You're breaking that man down.
*  That's the task. You don't exist.
*  Like crazy shit like that.
*  Telling that to a 13 year old.
*  And then you have the perfect storm of this 13 year old is incredibly physically gifted.
*  Yeah. Right. He was 13 years old.
*  He weighed 190 pounds.
*  And Teddy Atlas told me he would bring him to these smokers.
*  A smoker is like an amateur boxing event that they would do in boxing gyms.
*  And he'd bring him to these smokers and everybody would lie.
*  Like, how many fights this guy have?
*  Oh, he's only had two fights.
*  Yeah, he's had like 30 fights. Right.
*  And so they bring Tyson. He goes, how old is the kid?
*  He goes, he's 13.
*  He was like, that fucking kid is not 13.
*  He's like, OK, 16.
*  How old do you want him to be? Yeah.
*  And he goes, OK, 16. I got a 16 year old for him.
*  He just smashed this poor guy.
*  But he was 13. He was just smashing people.
*  Yeah. It was the first thing that he ever did that got him real love and attention.
*  And the first thing he ever did were people like, you're special.
*  There's something to you.
*  And then he has this guy in custom model who's a legend in boxing.
*  Yeah. One of the most respected legendary trainers in boxing. Right.
*  He had trained Jose Torres, Floyd Patterson.
*  And there he is.
*  And he's he's giving this kid information and talking to this kid.
*  Yeah. About what he can accomplish and what he could be.
*  And credible. Yeah.
*  I mean, look at that. Yeah.
*  That was when he was full Jack Dempsey mode. Yeah.
*  That was when he was 19.
*  He was awesome, man. Yeah.
*  I just think I would not want to be in there with him.
*  No, I just definitely not me.
*  But I mean, if I was a heavyweight boxer who is like anywhere near his age,
*  I just I don't I don't want none of that.
*  I wonder how we do like if he came back in shape,
*  I wonder how we do like against Tyson Fury.
*  The real problem is he's no matter what you do, he's still 54.
*  Yeah. No matter what you do.
*  But those guys still don't knock out.
*  Well, listen, listen. Yes, they do.
*  They do. They go hard.
*  Oh, fuck. But Tyson Fury is six foot nine.
*  I know. I know. He's my Tyson is pretty close to my side.
*  OK. Yeah. Yeah.
*  When I stand next to him, it's not we're not like in a different universe.
*  Yeah. Tyson Fury is in a different universe in me.
*  When I met him, I'm like, hello, giant.
*  Like he's a he's a giant like and he's a big giant.
*  Like Deontay Wilder is a giant, too.
*  But yeah, slender Deontay Wilder doesn't weigh much more than me,
*  which is crazy, dude.
*  He fought when he fought Tyson Fury the first time and he dropped him twice.
*  Yeah. He weighed 209. Wow. 209.
*  Wow. And he's six, six, nine, something crazy like that. Six, seven.
*  He's huge. Real. But he's a preposterous power puncher.
*  Yeah. He's preposterous.
*  Yeah. 40 knockouts or something.
*  Yeah. Like he knocked out everybody except one dude and Tyson Fury.
*  Yeah. In the last fight and then in both fights, you know, in the last fight,
*  he got stopped by Tyson Fury.
*  I love Tyson's fury story, though, too. It's amazing.
*  I mean, yeah. What a fact.
*  Back. Yeah. The fact that he was like literally accelerating his Ferrari
*  towards a bridge to kill himself.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  And then decided not to and just was like really fucked up.
*  Dude, boxing by itself, just just that, just getting hit in the head.
*  It's not good for your brain.
*  No, it's just not.
*  And then you have cocaine and booze and chaos and fame
*  and all those things that came after he beat Vladimir Klitschko.
*  Yeah. And he didn't just beat Vladimir Klitschko.
*  He humiliated him. Yeah.
*  Mocked him. Yeah. Taunted him.
*  He outboxed him. He's such a good boxer.
*  He sang in the ring. Horrible songs. Oh, God.
*  Yeah. I mean, he's so so good.
*  He's so good. Yeah.
*  I mean, technique wise. Yeah. Amazing.
*  Well, and then coming back and using that guy from Kronk
*  Sugar Hill, right? That's the his trainer for the last fight.
*  I believe that's the gentleman from Kronk.
*  Kronk was Emanuel Stewart's gym, which created Tommy Hearns
*  and Gerald McClellan and all these fucking assassins.
*  And they had this real aggressive attacking style.
*  And he took on that style for the second fight with Deontay.
*  So he came after him, which.
*  Yes, Sugar Hill, Sugar Hill Stewart.
*  And he is that Emanuel's son?
*  I don't know. I don't know that.
*  But that would be amazing if it was. Yeah. I mean.
*  But he had a different style.
*  He came after Deontay. Yeah.
*  And he realized that Deontay does not fight as well going back. Right.
*  But Deontay hits dudes in like the top of the head and puts him to sleep.
*  He hits he hits guys.
*  And it's like, what happened?
*  Like they got shot with a sniper rifle. Crazy.
*  Such big humans like I, you know, thinking of it now.
*  You're right. I mean, giants, giants, giants with skill, though.
*  Yeah. Tyson's so big. Tyson Fury. He's so huge. Yeah.
*  All right. So I'll go Logan Paul, Mike Tyson, if they both win.
*  You imagine they set that up.
*  Listen, that's a real thing that could happen.
*  I know if they both win because Logan's not going to win.
*  He's not going to win. Do the one.
*  I can't imagine that happening.
*  I'm not a gambling man, per se,
*  but I would be willing to bet a million dollars that he's not going to knock out
*  Floyd Mayweather.
*  I'd be like, I just can't imagine a world where that takes place.
*  Yeah, it could happen.
*  Don't get me wrong. It could happen. Yeah, it's a fight game.
*  It would be the weirdest moment in all of boxing.
*  If Logan Paul connects with a big punch and knocks Floyd Mayweather out.
*  Oh, God. It'd be it'd be horrible.
*  A lot of ways.
*  A lot of ways. A lot of ways it would be amazing.
*  Yeah, it would be both horrible and amazing. Yeah.
*  It's his nephew. Yeah.
*  So, you know, they they they devise a perfect strategy.
*  Sugarhill and and Tyson Fury in the rematch.
*  But then there's going to be another fight in December.
*  So they're fighting again.
*  The third fight is going to be in December. Who?
*  Wait, Deontay Wilder and Tyson Fury. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah, right. OK. Yeah.
*  It's weird watching these fights with no audience, too. Yeah.
*  It's weird. How do you I mean, do you like doing UFC with no?
*  I do like it. Yeah, I don't not like it.
*  I do like it. Yeah.
*  The thing about it that's really strange is you hear everything.
*  You hear a grunt.
*  You hear deep breaths.
*  You hear shit talk.
*  You hear corners coaching like really clearly.
*  You know, like, you know, three five, three five.
*  Like look for the left.
*  Move to the side. Stay away from his right leg.
*  Like all these things. Get out of kicking range.
*  Like you hear things that you don't necessarily hear
*  unless those guys are miked up and we, you know, sometimes occasionally
*  when there's a live crowd, we'll tune into those people.
*  Like you have you tune into them.
*  And then, you know, the coach will there'll be a camera on them
*  and will listen to the corner while they're giving instructions.
*  But it's not most of the time. It's just occasionally. Right.
*  But during these big fights with no audience, you hear everything
*  the coaches are saying, everything. Yeah.
*  They have this date in December locked up for the Vegas New Football Stadium.
*  Oh, only because they're hoping to have fans there for it.
*  So I don't know how many, but it lines up with the NFL schedule.
*  So the venues open.
*  How is that possible?
*  Do you think they were hoping to have fifteen thousand, I think.
*  So it'd be definitely distanced in there.
*  I don't know how, though.
*  Yeah, because it's stadium probably holds right close to 80, 90.
*  Yeah. So they'd be all spread out.
*  How weird. I know.
*  But I mean, would you want to go there?
*  Yeah. Fifteen thousand people coffin.
*  There's a football game last night in Cleveland.
*  There's six thousand people there and they still had a fight in the stands.
*  You know, people get drunk, they watch football.
*  That's what they want to do. They're going to go to Vegas.
*  They're going to party. They're going to be crazy.
*  Hey, Cleveland, Cleveland won. They did.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  Hopes that fans be able to attend.
*  Maybe. Well, at a certain point in time, I believe it's after the election.
*  Yeah. So it'd be over.
*  Yeah. After the election, it's all going to be fine unless there's riots.
*  Who knows what's going to happen after the election?
*  The world could be filled with chaos after the election.
*  Man, I don't know.
*  Where are the fights this weekend?
*  They are taking place in Vegas.
*  This is at the Apex Center.
*  And then next weekend is Fight Island.
*  So the next few fights are at Fight Island.
*  But this one this one's at the Apex Center, which is an awesome place for fights.
*  It's awesome. The acoustics are amazing.
*  The way they have it set up is amazing.
*  And the UFC kudos to the UFC for doing the right job, doing the best job they can.
*  They they test the shit out of everybody.
*  Everybody wears masks. Yeah, it is.
*  Fight night. What's the card?
*  Let me see the card.
*  I know Cowboys on the card
*  against Nico Price as a tough fight, and that dude comes that
*  I say his last name, Chamaev.
*  Oh, my God. He's a beast.
*  That kid is a beast. Yeah.
*  That's an interesting fight. Very confident.
*  But Joe, Joe, Joe Mearshart has got a lot of experience.
*  Yeah. Lots of you know. Yeah.
*  Forty four fights, forty four fights, Johnny Walker and Ryan Spann. Mm hmm.
*  Oh, Mackenzie Dern, Kevin Holland, Darren Stewart.
*  This is good fights. Mackenzie Dern. Yeah. Good fights.
*  Who do you got? Who do you got in the headliner?
*  Colby. It's a it's listen.
*  Tyron Woodley is one of the greatest welterweights of all time.
*  There's no doubt about it.
*  But his last two fights have not been his best. Yeah.
*  He lost two decisions in a row,
*  but he also lost two decisions in a row to a guy in Kamaru Usman,
*  who I think is one of the greatest of all time.
*  I think Usman is just an unstoppable beast.
*  And you saw what he's the only guy that's been able to shut down Colby.
*  Yeah, that's how good Kamaru Usman is.
*  Shut him down and outlasted him and then one of the beating Colby up
*  in the final round, broke his jaw, stopped him.
*  But if Tyron Woodley can regain
*  the the form that he had when he beat Darren Till,
*  the form that he had, we knocked out Robbie Lawler,
*  the form that he had when he was at the top of his game.
*  You know, he gives everybody problems. Yeah.
*  But the question is, like, what has been going on?
*  Is it just that he's he's meeting some of the best guys ever,
*  like in Gilbert Burns, who's elite? Gilbert Burns is elite.
*  Yeah. And Kamaru Usman is elite.
*  But you can make an argument that he's lost 10 rounds in a row,
*  the last 10 rounds in a row, which is incredible.
*  If you think about before that fight, if you go back to before the fight
*  with Kamaru Usman, if someone told you Tyron Woodley before this fight
*  is going to lose 10 rounds in a row, you'd be like, get the fuck out of here.
*  He's a destroyer. Yeah. Tyron Woodley is a destroyer.
*  It's sometimes fighters, they have peaks and valleys,
*  and sometimes they return better and stronger than ever.
*  And sometimes it's the start of a downward slide.
*  And Colby is a real test to find out where he's at,
*  because there's going to be a lot of emotions coming into this fight.
*  And Tyron, for sure, is the bigger puncher, for sure.
*  Tyron is a legit one punch knockout artist.
*  But Colby has a third lung.
*  He's got a crazy gas tank. Yeah.
*  And it's you can't just take him out.
*  You got to beat him down like Usman beat him down.
*  And even then he was protesting the stoppage with a jaw literally snapped
*  in half, blood pouring out of his mouth and pissed that they stopped the fight.
*  He's a tough kid. He's a fucking animal.
*  Yeah, he's a fucking animal.
*  And he's an animal that wants the belt, you know, and he wants to get back in there.
*  And this striking looked pretty good in that fight. Pretty fucking good.
*  And so we know he's a wrestler.
*  He's got like, I think, the most takedowns right now
*  of anybody active.
*  Well, he he has a crazy pace.
*  Yeah. You know, we were talking about Michael Chiesa.
*  You were saying that Michael Chiesa said you can't just have a good camp.
*  Has to be your best camp ever.
*  Yeah. If you're fighting Colby, you better pack a fucking lunch. Yeah.
*  He's he's got a pace that's just hard to believe. Right.
*  And that's that's Woodley's kryptonite.
*  In some ways, it has been Woodley's kryptonite.
*  It certainly was in the Usman fight.
*  But, you know, the thing about Woodley is, at least in those camps,
*  and in these moments in the past, he has had personal problems.
*  He's had career issues.
*  He's had distractions like he was starting a rap career.
*  He was involved in a lot of other things that when I think
*  when a fighter is at their best, they're there of a singular mission.
*  And that singular mission is like to seek and destroy.
*  And to just train and to just fight.
*  I think everything else on top of that, you can do it.
*  You can do it. Maybe you'll be successful.
*  Maybe you win by knockout.
*  Maybe maybe you'll maybe you're just better.
*  Yeah. But maybe not.
*  Maybe you'll sap just a little bit of you.
*  And maybe maybe those exchanges where you could come out on top, you don't.
*  Right. The other guy comes on top and then you drop down a little bit.
*  And then you don't have the recovery because you haven't trained
*  as hard as maybe you could have.
*  Or the distractions have kept you from just being completely focused
*  and centered on your game. Yeah.
*  I think that you saw that with Ronda Rousey
*  as Ronda Rousey got more and more famous, there was more and more distractions.
*  There was movie scripts and there was television shows.
*  There was all these different things that came to her.
*  Yeah. And at the end of the day, there was also Holly Holm,
*  who was the best striker she ever faced.
*  And Holly stopped her and changed, changed the whole game.
*  Well, the thing about Colby Covington
*  is that all that motherfucker does is train and talk shit.
*  He trains and talk shit and makes videos.
*  Makes videos with girls with girls in their bikinis.
*  And he's talking shit in those videos, too.
*  He's wearing a MAGA hat.
*  And there's so much emotions when you're fighting.
*  But that's the only time he's not training.
*  I mean, he is so focused on training and getting to be the best.
*  I mean, you know him well.
*  We should tell people you've trained with him.
*  You've run together.
*  You've done. He's trained at your gym.
*  Yeah, he has. And he's just a hardworking kid.
*  He's got the best attitude, the most respectful guy.
*  You know, this is what he does on camera is a whole different thing.
*  But when he's there to train, that's all he cares about.
*  And that's what he does every single day.
*  It's like he's obsessed with being the best.
*  And it's it's tough to, you know, when you're at your prime
*  and you're as good as he is, we talked about talent.
*  And then also you train and you eliminate those distractions.
*  It's a that's a package.
*  Yeah. And I think that training with you also
*  when you know, when you took that dude running and you run Mount Pisgah,
*  Pigska, how do you say that? Piska Piska.
*  Yeah. Why is it got a P in there?
*  Pisgah, I said, I asked G.A.H.
*  How's that Pisgah? Yeah.
*  But this should be a G in there somewhere.
*  No, P.I.S. G.A.H. Yeah.
*  But how do you say it? You're not saying it with a G. Pisgah.
*  G. Yeah. You I thought you said Pisgah.
*  Say maybe I do. Pisgah.
*  Yeah. See, there's no G in there.
*  Whatever. You're not saying it's like people who say Oregon.
*  It's Oregon. Oregon. So I'm good.
*  Good. Still G. OK. Pisgah.
*  That's a K. And just saying that when you're from there, you just say, OK.
*  I get it. But when he runs down with you and he realizes like,
*  well, there's levels to endurance, there's levels to cardio.
*  That has got to help him.
*  I mean, the guy your age, you're so much older than him.
*  And you're like way outpacing him when you guys are running together.
*  Like that's got to let him know.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  Like as much as you think you're pushing it, the grind never stops.
*  Yeah. And someone like you who does that grind every fucking day,
*  you get to this level of endurance and people that think they're in good shape.
*  Like I talked to a bunch of the Sorenix guys that went running with you.
*  Yeah. Like, yeah, I thought I was in pretty good shape.
*  Yeah, it's just it's different.
*  But Colby is always has been known as a person cardio, so he does really well.
*  But he'll he'll admit to that.
*  I mean, I'm only doing that.
*  So I'm not hitting pads. I'm not wrestling.
*  So it's like it's easy for me to focus on on endurance.
*  But he does say that.
*  So it has opened his eyes.
*  He said to there is another level.
*  Yeah, that's where he's been obsessed with getting.
*  Yeah. The other level of endurance and conditioning has always been this place
*  where people reach and then realize it.
*  I remember Tito Ortiz fought Frank Shamrock.
*  This is back when Tito Ortiz was at the top.
*  Before he was really at the top of his game.
*  Training a big bear.
*  I think he was training a big bear.
*  I don't know if he was training a big bear back then,
*  because this was the fight where Frank Shamrock outworked him.
*  And Frank Shamrock wound up beating him down and stopping him.
*  OK. And when it happened, Tito became this cardio monster afterwards
*  and focused on cardio.
*  It was it was a great lesson.
*  He realized like, wow, like I fell apart
*  because I got exhausted.
*  And before he was able to smash these people because he's this really big,
*  strong kid, and he was a very good wrestler, just tough as fuck.
*  And he's ready to scrap.
*  And he wound up running into a guy in Shamrock that was trained better.
*  Was smarter, was just had a better game plan and was an insane cardio.
*  And Frank just outworked him and wound up stopping him.
*  And then Tito became this guy who realized like, oh, cardio is everything.
*  Right. Cardio is an OK.
*  I remember Kendall Grove, who was a great fighter from Hawaii.
*  I remember still around.
*  He trained with Tito on the Ultimate Fighter and then said to me, he goes,
*  Dude, it opened my eyes.
*  He goes, cardio is everything.
*  Yeah, cardio is everything. Yeah.
*  And you realize that these guys that have a certain amount of conditioning,
*  they have a certain amount of ability.
*  If you add extreme cardio, then the other guy gets tired and you don't.
*  And when you see someone tired and you're not tired, it's amazing.
*  It's amazing that feeling you like, what's up?
*  Yeah, it's got to go good.
*  Oh, it's it feels amazing.
*  And the same fatigue makes cowards of us all. Yep.
*  You know, so you as a fighter, when you're when you're, you know, fresh,
*  you could be a whole different fighter than when you're tired. Yep. All of a sudden.
*  Being choked out wouldn't be that bad. Let me get out of here.
*  Yep. Yep. And that is what happens to your brain starts to looking for ways out.
*  Yeah. You know, you give up your back, you give up an arm.
*  You know, like you see guys, you see guys getting mounted
*  and you see them literally reach up and they're kind of giving an arm. Yeah.
*  And they're so tired. They're like, take my neck.
*  But and that's what that's a big thing to me.
*  The difference in the fight is I Colby was tired as a fifth round.
*  He was beat up. He never gave up.
*  That's true. But neither did Tyron.
*  You got to realize Tyron fought Gilbert Burns.
*  Gilbert Burns put a beat on him in the first round.
*  Tyron never looked for a way out. He kept trying to win that fight.
*  Gilbert was a step ahead of him.
*  And Gilbert wound up winning basically every round.
*  But Tyron never looked for a way out.
*  Did you think that I felt like he didn't he sort of gave up against Usman?
*  I don't think he gave up. I think that's all he had.
*  I think that's all he had.
*  Like he was doing shit in that fight.
*  Well, I think first of all, he's trying to stay alive
*  because Usman put a beating on him.
*  I think it was one round. I think it was the fourth round.
*  He unloaded this horrific combination on him.
*  And I talked to Usman about it.
*  And he was like, I was trying to take him out.
*  And it was then I realized he wasn't going anywhere.
*  I was like, oh, shit, I'm tired.
*  My gas tank. Yeah.
*  But, you know, I think Tyron's trying to win with everything he had.
*  But I don't think he had enough that day.
*  And I talked to him about that fight afterwards.
*  And he said that wasn't me because I wasn't there.
*  Anybody who knows me knows that that wasn't me.
*  Yeah. But so so how do you do that?
*  How do you go to a fight?
*  And that's not you.
*  You know, what we talked about, about distractions and about all these
*  different things and, you know, it's it's hard
*  being a professional prize fighter is one of the most difficult things
*  that anybody could do in athletics.
*  I mean, I'm sitting on the couch talking shit.
*  But you're not sitting on the couch. You do difficult things.
*  I mean, you've done the Moab 240.
*  You've run 240 fucking miles in the mountains.
*  You know what difficult things are.
*  The thing about fighting is that you're you're getting hit
*  and someone is hitting you.
*  The thing there's there's battles and maybe as difficult, if not more difficult,
*  the battles that play out in your own mind when you're running
*  for three days in the mountains.
*  Yeah. But there's something about people hitting you
*  and about knowing that this guy like when you're sparring,
*  say, and you realize that a guy is faster than you.
*  Like, oh, OK, like I'm trying to do this and I'm getting cracked
*  as I'm coming in, his timing's better.
*  And you have to readjust and you're constantly thinking.
*  It's a crazy management battle because you're estimating what you can do
*  and you're calculating what you need to like.
*  You need to faint your way in.
*  You need to you need to redirect or misdirect.
*  You're trying to figure it out.
*  So it's draining. It's exhausting.
*  And then you're getting pink.
*  Then you're getting dinged up and you're trying to win.
*  But you just don't have it. Right.
*  You know, and that's what I saw with Tyron Woodley.
*  I never saw any quit.
*  There was no quit because he could have quit.
*  He could have found a way out. He's a champion.
*  He could have found a way out in either one of those fights.
*  The thing about this Colby Covening fight is you got to be ready.
*  You got to be ready.
*  And if he's ready and if you if we're getting the Tyron Woodley
*  that knocked out Robbie Lawler, if we're getting the Tyron Woodley
*  that stopped Carlos Conde, we're getting the real Tyron Woodley.
*  If we're getting that guy, it's going to be an interesting fight
*  because they fucking hate each other.
*  They fucking hate each other.
*  And Tyron does not want to lose three fights in a row.
*  No, no.
*  And Colby says he's expecting the best Tyron Woodley.
*  He calls him Tyrone. Yeah.
*  Tyron Woodley, you pussied out.
*  This should have been you. All that shit.
*  I know. This is your ass kicking.
*  Yeah. Why did you let this man take this ass beating for you?
*  Yeah. I mean, it's going to be so he's expecting the best.
*  Yeah. And he says he's just he says he's going to end the fight.
*  When he if and when he wins the title, I want to get him in here in here.
*  I want I want to tell the story of why he created this character,
*  because it's a really interesting story, because if you talk to Colby
*  outside the octagon, like you said, he's a very respectful dude.
*  He's really smart and nice and he's very smart.
*  He's a he's a like he's there like he's a he's a very articulate
*  like really engaging person.
*  Yeah. He's charismatic. Yeah.
*  But what he realized was he was about to get cut.
*  And the UFC just they they were literally telling him
*  like we we don't like your style.
*  We don't like the way you're fighting. We're going to cut you.
*  So he goes to Brazil. Mm hmm.
*  It's like Damien Mayen, Brazil.
*  And he starts talking bad shit. Yeah.
*  Cause I'm a bunch of filthy animals and said the place is a dump.
*  Yeah. And everybody goes nuts.
*  And he was after he beat it.
*  I mean, he said it on the mic afterwards. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  After he won. Yeah.
*  And I don't.
*  Maya's never been beat up like that, has he?
*  Tyron beat him up pretty bad.
*  And Gilbert Burns knocked him out his last fight.
*  But Damien Mayen is 41, I think. Yeah.
*  You know, he's he's one of the greatest Jiu Jitsu artists
*  that's ever competed in MMA.
*  There it is. Look at that. Is this right now?
*  Yeah. Early today. Oh, shit.
*  Look how focused Colby looks. God damn.
*  He's so focused.
*  Oh, oh.
*  Oh, that's intense.
*  This is intense.
*  That looks good.
*  I was sure it says legalize being black. What?
*  It's illegal. Did you know? Yeah.
*  It's it's. We look good there, didn't.
*  Yeah. He looks really, really intense. Yeah.
*  It's hard to see if Tyron's intense because he's got glasses on.
*  He's wearing sunglasses.
*  It's it's a crazy fight, man.
*  It's a crazy fight.
*  But yeah, Colby in Brazil knew they said
*  what he says is UFC said they're going to cut him, win or lose.
*  Yeah. And so we made.
*  He started talking crazy shit.
*  Everybody went nuts and a lot of eyes on him.
*  And they're like, we like what you're doing.
*  So they basically and he it was it was a career saving move
*  that turned him into a star. Yeah.
*  And out of nowhere.
*  I look, I talked to him before that he was not that guy before that.
*  He was just a guy who was training and fighting and doing really well.
*  That's who he still is.
*  And he had a great style.
*  I mean, his style was that style of like really high pace.
*  Stays on people.
*  He only had one loss previous to the Kamaru Usman fight.
*  And that was a fight that he took with a fucked up rib.
*  Yeah. He was hurt.
*  Yeah. He needed money.
*  He needed the cash, which is this the life of a young upcoming prizefighter.
*  Yeah. But he's special.
*  He's not, you know, he tricks people with the cheap suits
*  and the MAGA hat and all that trash talk.
*  Like this is a that is a facade.
*  But the thing is, that makes it harder
*  like to talk all that shit and then go and fight.
*  Pressure on yourself.
*  People want you to lose, man.
*  You put a lot of pressure.
*  Yeah. And he's good at it.
*  He's good at dealing with that.
*  And I even I've heard stories about him back in college wrestling.
*  And he still had that confidence where he'd be wrestling.
*  And talking to the crowd.
*  That's amazing.
*  Yeah. While he's wrestling during the match against, you know,
*  the best wrestlers in the country.
*  I mean, well, there's something about that that distracts the opponent to,
*  you know, people do that like Floyd Mayweather does a lot of that inspiring.
*  Yeah. James Tony was famous for that.
*  James Tony, who's like, without a doubt, one of the best defensive boxers of his era.
*  He was an amazing boxer.
*  And James Tony would talk mad shit during fights.
*  That's it, bitch. So you got bitch.
*  This is it, bitch. Yeah. So you got bitch.
*  And then he popped you with a jab and hook you.
*  Come on, bitch. Come on, bitch.
*  You ain't got shit. You ain't got shit. Pop, pop.
*  You got shit. Pop, pop.
*  Yeah. And he did it in sparring.
*  There's see if Google James Tony talking shit during sparring.
*  It was legendary.
*  People go to wild card gym just to watch James Tony box and talk shit to people.
*  And he would get like World Championship caliber fighters and like, come on, bitch.
*  Let's spar, bitch.
*  He would like take guys that maybe he would fight in the future.
*  You know, like he didn't care.
*  He's like, come on, get in here.
*  And he had that like that shoulder roll style.
*  So like Floyd. Yeah. But but he's thick.
*  You know, he's a big, thick dude.
*  So you get up in here and get on top of guys and push them up against the rope
*  and talk shit and hook them. That'd be rough. Yeah.
*  His his fight with Roy Jones Jr.
*  was when they were both in their prime and James Tony was a destroyer.
*  And Roy Jones Jr. just was too fast, too slick.
*  See, if you could hear this, can you hear some of this?
*  He just talks shit.
*  Oh, that's Danny Green, who is a world class fighter.
*  I don't know where the look how thick he is.
*  God damn, James Tony looks good here.
*  You know, big he is. Oh.
*  I don't know if it's if they're shit talking in this
*  or if it's just like regular boxing sparring.
*  But Danny Green, I believe when when these guys sparred,
*  Danny Green was a top contender.
*  Rogan made this video famous 12 years ago.
*  Let's talk about six months ago.
*  It says 12 years after I uploaded it.
*  Oh, that's hilarious.
*  That's good. That's hilarious.
*  Well, I made it famous again.
*  I love watching boxing sparring matches.
*  I love I love I love I love like watching anything. Here's.
*  So you're scared to get hit, you're European.
*  Yeah.
*  Oh, God.
*  See, that fucks with people's heads.
*  Yeah, definitely.
*  Then you take a stiff jab.
*  Yeah.
*  He's talking shit to.
*  Oh, come on.
*  Oh, God, those punches are so good.
*  I'm going to go get a drink.
*  Oh, God, those punches are stout.
*  Yeah. Well, he was just he was fantastic at like these
*  like really tight, like in close combat fights
*  of like giving you a shoulder and pop you a short hooks
*  and turning angles on you.
*  He was just super skillful.
*  He just wasn't the most disciplined guy.
*  Yeah. So like a lot of times he would show up for fights.
*  He didn't have big hands.
*  Right. Because it was Radio Raheem. He filmed those.
*  Oh, that's right. That's what that was. That's right.
*  He also fought in the UFC.
*  He fought Randy Couture.
*  Yeah, I remember that.
*  Randy Couture just hit him with a low ankle and took him down.
*  Mounted him. I think he arm.
*  I think he arm triangle them.
*  Think I'm going to hit an arm choke.
*  But isn't that so?
*  I mean, you said you like watching training.
*  Yeah. Like, I mean, that's how you you watched me shooting
*  when you first wanted to have me on the on the podcast years ago.
*  So what is it about?
*  It's like watching people put in work for for discipline.
*  Is that what you're is you like to see?
*  Yeah. Is that what everybody likes to see?
*  I get inspired by greatness.
*  People that are great at anything, even great at shit that I don't ever want to do.
*  Like if I see a guy play the harp.
*  Yeah. Fucking awesome. I get fired up. Yeah, me too.
*  I just love watching people put in work.
*  Yeah. I think there's something that's an incredible resource that we have today
*  with videos, whether it's YouTube videos or any kind of video on Instagram
*  or what have you, where you can watch them and you get you get fired up.
*  Like that's a boundless resource.
*  Yeah. You know, you need discipline to get things done in this life.
*  But inspiration is nice. Yeah.
*  It's nice. It helps give you a little extra juice.
*  You won't get there without discipline.
*  Yeah. Like if you only train when you're inspired.
*  Fuck. Good luck. You're not going to you're not going to.
*  You're going to get fat. Yeah, that's right.
*  You need discipline. But inspiration is nice.
*  Yeah, it's nice to have.
*  There's something about it to me.
*  I just take advantage of it.
*  I think it's a it's an amazing resource.
*  So whether it's watching a guy like you shoot and watching your dedication,
*  your training footage and all that stuff, like I love the fact
*  you're always putting those the Soren X lab on an Instagram
*  and you do those long videos where you and who's in there with you?
*  Is it Eric the trainer dude?
*  No, that's that's Nick the trainer dude.
*  Eric McCormick is outlaw strength, outlaw strength.
*  That's right. Yeah.
*  But that you do it with these guys and you have these
*  you bring people in to train with you and you have these.
*  It's just I need to know that other people are working.
*  Yeah, I like it. I want to see it.
*  I want to see motion.
*  I want to make sure I put my fucking shoes on and go.
*  It's weird because those videos sometimes they'll get
*  for me is a lot, but 200000 views on just raising this lifting.
*  Yeah, it's crazy.
*  But so people aren't unlike you.
*  I mean, they want that to.
*  They love it. Those Goggins videos.
*  I put a Goggins video on my page of the day.
*  I got two million views.
*  Yeah, because it's just him talking shit about himself.
*  Which is what's hilarious.
*  He's talking shit about his own like lack of motivation.
*  Is that where he said he videoed him?
*  So being a being a bitch. Yeah.
*  He was a sound like a straight bitch.
*  God, I love that guy. Stay hard.
*  I love that guy.
*  How could he not make somebody want to work harder?
*  I mean, you are going to work harder than you were going to work out for sure.
*  You're not going to probably work out as hard as him,
*  but you're going to work out harder than you would have knowing
*  that there's dudes like that out there.
*  Yeah, I think that's what's that's what people need to realize.
*  And I think you provide that as well,
*  because people have this idea of how hard they're working.
*  And it's usually grossly inflated. Yeah.
*  You know, most most people, they don't have the experience
*  of driving themselves on a daily basis to excellence.
*  They kind of put in some work and then they pat themselves on the back.
*  They think they did a good job. Yeah, right.
*  Even guys who kind of work out kind of hard, like I'm fucking in there hushling.
*  Are you? Are you really?
*  Let me show you some videos, bro.
*  Here's here's. Yeah, here's my friend.
*  It gets over three in the morning and runs a marathon before work.
*  Well, every place I've went this year, it's like
*  to a crowd where I haven't been around.
*  They've talked about true doing pull ups.
*  That was your son. It's hilarious.
*  They'll be like, so now,
*  did he do chin ups to and pull ups and switch around?
*  I'm like, no, just just pull up.
*  So push ups. Did you do any?
*  Nope. Just just pull ups in that.
*  Pull ups are so hard.
*  And how many pull ups did he do?
*  He did forty one hundred in twenty four hours.
*  Yes. 17 hours, like thirty five.
*  Forty one hundred pull ups.
*  Yeah. Yeah. That's a lot of pull ups.
*  His motivating factor was Goggins.
*  I mean, it's all about Goggins.
*  Goggins previous world record was four thousand thirty two.
*  And so I just told him, I said, well, you know, we we look up to Goggins
*  is like a god to us, you know, I mean, he's so such a badass.
*  And and just knowing him is is an honor.
*  But I said, well, if that's the goal to be Goggins,
*  you also have to beat his time.
*  Otherwise, what's the point?
*  So he did he he was able to do that.
*  And it was all about just trying to live up to the example Goggins said.
*  And he got it done.
*  But now a lot of people bring that up.
*  The Goggins pull up like what Goggins record was for pull ups.
*  How did he calculate it out?
*  Did he say if I do five every X amount of seconds, five a minute, five a minute,
*  you do five a minute, there's 60 minutes in an hour.
*  There's 300.
*  So you calculated it all out.
*  He said, as long as I can keep that pace, I can do this.
*  That's what Truett was doing.
*  He wanted to do five a minute.
*  Yeah. So then he fell behind a little bit.
*  And I was having him get back up on it because I showed up when he was about
*  maybe 2000 in.
*  I flew in and, you know, and he was doing pretty good.
*  But he started to fall behind.
*  So then I was getting him back up on that bar.
*  You know, I'd look at the clock and say, you don't you don't have
*  you got to get back up there now. Let's go.
*  Did you play him the scene where Adrian tells Rocky Rocky?
*  No, no. Just when the one that Goggins likes is round 14.
*  I think in when Apollo had Rocky hurt
*  and then Rocky gets up and Apollo had his hands up and then he looks back
*  and Rockies up and Apollo just shakes his head.
*  And he's like, I can't this fucker won't quit.
*  So that's what Goggins Goggins.
*  He replayed that over and over. That's amazing.
*  Yeah, yeah. That's isn't that funny.
*  But anyway, Goggins is like it's so he's so powerful to so many people,
*  including my son. So, I mean, it's it's well, I got to say,
*  you raised two savage sons. You did a pretty fucking good job.
*  Yeah, you really did. Thank you.
*  You have two amazing sons. Yeah.
*  Tanner Tanner right now is a stud.
*  Last time I saw him was like, look at you, man.
*  Yeah, I remember when you were young. Yeah, I know.
*  Just a few years ago, he was a boy.
*  Now he's this big, savage man. Yeah, yeah.
*  He's a and he's a ranger. Yeah, he's in the army and beast.
*  Yeah, I mean, I feel no Tanner and true.
*  You should be you should be very proud.
*  You did an amazing job.
*  And it's your example that you've set.
*  And that's that's a powerful thing.
*  It's it's not just powerful because you set that example,
*  but you also set an example to them and they will set examples to other people.
*  And it's a butterfly effect.
*  And it'll pass on.
*  You know, there's a thing that you're doing
*  that when putting putting out the kind of work that you do
*  and the consistency that you do,
*  people know that they can always come to your Instagram page
*  and they're going to get this like consistent message and consistent work ethic.
*  And that's very it's it's fuel for people.
*  And it's it's it's wind.
*  It's like wind on the sail. It pushes people.
*  And you probably have no idea
*  how many countless people you've inspired by doing that.
*  Thank you. Yeah. Pretty amazing.
*  Yeah. I mean, I I feel lucky
*  just to have the life that I have.
*  I mean, it's, you know, I don't know.
*  I never would have envisioned this coming from where I came from.
*  Do you also feel motivated because so many people are watching
*  because so many people look up to you? Yeah.
*  I mean, I I'm going to do what I do.
*  It's you know, you can't fake it for this long.
*  I'm going to do what I do.
*  But I also know that I'm I got to hold myself accountable
*  because people are paying attention and I want to help them.
*  I want to be I want to be like you said, that wind in their sail.
*  And so I I owe it to well, I always
*  I think for the most part, I feel like I owe it to Roy
*  to give the best I have every day.
*  I think about him often.
*  People don't some people don't know Roy is.
*  Yeah. Roy is my hunting partner who got me started in bow hunting back in 1988.
*  And he died sheep hunting in 2015 and he fell.
*  And so it's, you know, I think of the side of a mountain.
*  Yeah, I felt I think about how he lived his life and how tough he was
*  and and what he meant to me.
*  And I just, you know, so I want to honor him.
*  I want to honor his memory.
*  And like I always say, when I talk about Roy's legends, never die.
*  And I don't want his legend to die.
*  So to me, you know, it's and I've talked about this before, but even
*  I've had a lot of hunting success and it just feels
*  it's it's not quite the same because Roy's not here
*  because I'm not able to share it with him.
*  And that was our we call and update if we weren't hunting together,
*  which we had two amazing hunts his last last year right before he fell.
*  And it's like it's a little it's just different.
*  It's not the same.
*  And so I do do it for him.
*  I do it to, I mean, for my life, you know, I feel like I got to give the best I have.
*  And I do it, you know, to hopefully been that be the wind and people sail.
*  And yeah, I mean, we're all connected in this weird way, right?
*  That's what's interesting about social media.
*  There's a lot of negative aspects of social media,
*  but there's some positive aspects, too, that are undeniable.
*  And one of them is that we all do inspire and motivate each other.
*  And whether people inspire and motivate you because they look up to you
*  or because they follow you because they're interested in what you do
*  or because you look up to them and you see them and you see how hard they're working.
*  And it makes you want to get after it.
*  We imitate our atmosphere, you know, and if you are following
*  good, positive people, good, supportive, positive people
*  that are out there really putting in work and like,
*  it makes you want to be one of those people.
*  Yeah, I think so.
*  That's how it works on me.
*  I do. I tell, you know, we have a mutual friend, Aaron Snyder.
*  I do tell him I miss the days a little bit where he used to talk shit about me
*  because he used to.
*  Because it motivates you.
*  Yeah, because I'm like I told him I texted him.
*  I'm like, God, I miss the days where he used to talk shit.
*  I said, I need that.
*  I need the old Aaron back.
*  Now he's super supportive, you know, and he's like.
*  Goggins tells me that he goes, I like shit talking.
*  He goes, I like the haters because I think about them fucking haters
*  when I get up in the morning.
*  Yeah, because I need those motherfuckers.
*  He says that I asked him specifically.
*  I asked Goggins specifically about that and about people who don't like him.
*  He's like, good. He goes, I like it like that. Fuck them.
*  Yeah, I mean, so you need it's weird.
*  It's it's a weird journey we're on where different things
*  can motivate you at different times.
*  But I do some weird way like reading hate sometimes.
*  I don't know why.
*  Well, sometimes you need an extra little bit of gas.
*  Need the actual juice.
*  Yeah. And that sometimes people want to prove people wrong.
*  Yeah. Sometimes that's that's good.
*  Yeah. And it's also knowing that they're just bitches.
*  You're not you know, there's something about knowing that there's weak bitches
*  out there in the world like, oh, look at you.
*  Look at you, cutie.
*  I couldn't imagine being one of those guys.
*  I could. I could.
*  I could if everything went totally wrong.
*  Yeah. If you just make bad decisions, you go on bad paths.
*  You got you got bad friends.
*  You get a bad job.
*  Yeah. Bad girlfriend or bad wife.
*  Yeah. Bad life and I mean, it could have bad habits and it could easily happen.
*  Drugs and alcohol and stealing and lying and next, you know, you hate yourself
*  and you're 35 and you don't know why.
*  You just like wish you were someone different and special.
*  And you see some guy out there just kick an ass.
*  Yeah. Fuck him.
*  Fuck you, loser.
*  He's faking it. He's doing this.
*  Like I've heard people say all kinds of crazy shit.
*  There's this one dude that I follow.
*  He's a martial arts guy.
*  People always accusing him of speeding up his videos.
*  Oh, you know, because he's so fast.
*  Yeah. There's people like that, man.
*  They just don't want to believe that.
*  And then there's other people that go, God damn, that guy's fast.
*  Yeah. I want to work out harder. Right.
*  And it's all in who you are.
*  You know. Yeah. And where you are in life.
*  Yeah. Find this guy on Instagram, Ericsson Samuel.
*  He's he's on Instagram and he's got these crazy videos of him doing kicks.
*  See if you could find it.
*  And just kick after kick after kick and super fast.
*  Oh, my God. He's ridiculous.
*  Yeah, he's so it's not sped up, right?
*  No, no, no, no, no, no.
*  Haters are saying, yeah, they're just haters. Yeah.
*  E R I C. OK.
*  There's there's a bunch of really good ones.
*  Go to the if you look at the grid, go to the second down on the left hand side.
*  I know far the watch this.
*  Oh, this is just him doing a jump spinning kick.
*  But there's some other ones like the middle one in the top row.
*  Go to the middle one, the top row, that one there.
*  No, it's not. It's a bit. Watch how fast this motherfucker is.
*  So he does a lot of these.
*  Yeah, he's just really talented, really skillful.
*  But he had to do a video addressing people that say that he's speeding up his videos.
*  Yeah. But that's how it always is.
*  These aren't the best videos.
*  He's got some other ones in there that are better.
*  Is he good? Yeah, he's good.
*  Yeah, he's good. I don't.
*  He's definitely fought MMA.
*  I don't know what his record are. I just like watching his videos.
*  I had some asked somebody yesterday, say they were going to
*  kill me and skin me like I do the animals. Interesting.
*  Yeah. What a sweet person.
*  They must be compassionate vegan.
*  Yeah. So that's always fun.
*  Yeah. I wonder. Yeah.
*  I wonder what they would say if they met you.
*  People, they get these ideas in their head
*  that a person who hunts or a person who is a meat eater
*  is causing all this terrible harm to the world and that they are a good person
*  and that this person is bad and they're going to threaten that person.
*  And then somehow or another, that's going to make it all better.
*  Or that they're showing you that, you know, they're there to stand up for the animals.
*  There's a lot of like mentally ill people, too.
*  There's a lot of that.
*  There's also a lot of people that they don't understand the harm they're doing.
*  They don't understand the harm they're doing just by buying vegetables
*  that grow in a monocrop situation.
*  You know how much shit how much shit gets poisoned?
*  Yeah. How many animals get ground up when they're using the combines?
*  Do you know?
*  Do you know what kind of damage it does to just an ecosystem
*  when you run a monocrop operation like most of the food that you buy?
*  Like human beings cause damage. We cause damage.
*  I mean, we know if you're living, you're causing death.
*  And you got to think like you personally are causing a small amount of damage.
*  Like you personally, for the food that you eat, are causing a small amount of damage.
*  But if you stop and think about L.A., like 20 million people
*  and all the corn and all the soybeans and all the almonds
*  you need for 20 million people like that adds up and it adds up to devastation.
*  It's crazy on wildlife and wildlife displacement
*  and just how unnatural it is to have massive fields of any one particular crop.
*  And all the animals that want to eat that stuff, they get wiped out and killed
*  and poison bugs and poison worms and all these different things
*  that wind up getting so much doubt. So much death.
*  And then then because I kill a bull elk. Yeah.
*  And and honor every ounce of that meat like it was gold.
*  And, you know, and that's what I would say is people, you know,
*  Americans throw away 40 percent of their food. Did you know that?
*  Yeah, I've heard of that 40 percent.
*  So part of that's going to be meat.
*  So as a hunter, every ounce of meat is, is, I always say, consider like gold.
*  And then you got people judging you that are, you know,
*  have a double bacon cheeseburger and they're like, Oh, God, I'm stuffed.
*  I can't eat another bite. Take this away.
*  It's like, what are you doing?
*  You paid for the death of that cow and you're so stuffed.
*  You're such a grunt that you're pushing it away and throwing in the garbage.
*  But you're but yet you're judging me.
*  Well, people just love to judge people because it's better than looking at themselves.
*  Yeah. You know, the thing about judging and attacking people online.
*  It's it's a fun sport for people that don't have other hobbies.
*  I guess so.
*  I mean, that's what I guess if I had to, if I could, if people could have a purpose,
*  I mean, I just don't think people feel like to have a real purpose in in life.
*  So that's where, you know, as you know, Bohemian is giving me a purpose.
*  It's like, oh, this is what I do.
*  So everything revolves around what I do.
*  And so it's I know people don't have don't feel like they have a purpose.
*  That's what I it'd be nice.
*  I think we'd be a lot happier society if people felt like they had
*  they were here for a reason and had a purpose.
*  Yeah. And, you know, there's no shortcuts in terms of your growth as a person.
*  And when you do have a purpose and you're pursuing that purpose
*  and you realize each step along the way, whether you're improving
*  or whether you need to improve and you've got you've got a task in front of you.
*  And you have this this direction and you have this this goal in life, this this focus.
*  It gives you real live feedback on how good you're doing,
*  how where you need to improve, how you're growing, where you're failing.
*  And some people never get that.
*  They don't they don't have that.
*  They just show up.
*  They do the most they do the least amount that they can do to not get fired.
*  And they go home and then they just sit around.
*  And they watch things happen on television and they talk shit.
*  That is sadly a lot of people.
*  And it's this is their existence and this is this unfulfilled life.
*  This is this unfulfilled time here.
*  And it's a it's a miserable time because the more you seek this comfort,
*  the more you seek this laziness and this sloth and just laying around doing nothing,
*  the more depressed you're going to be because you're not going to get that good feedback.
*  You're not going to get that growth.
*  You're not going to get that that feeling of accomplishment.
*  You're not going to get any of the things that make life exciting.
*  One of the reasons why like people why you get happy when you shoot an elk,
*  like the video that you and me that from last year, from my last year's hunt.
*  Mike, do you know how hard that is to do so hard?
*  Do you would know you shoot an animal that's 67 yards away?
*  Yeah, you have to make sure that you hit it right.
*  If you don't hit it right, you're you're wounding it.
*  And then this and it's also it's so difficult just to keep your nerves together
*  when you're you have so many hard aspects to doing that.
*  And hundreds and hundreds of hours of practice have to be in place.
*  Like you have you can't like be learning that day and doing that.
*  That shit has to be dialed in.
*  But out of context, it's for some people, they're like, whoa, what's going on?
*  These guys are laughing. Exactly. Out of context. Why are you happy?
*  Yeah, you're happy because it is an incredibly difficult thing to do.
*  And there's a massive amount of relief when you see that arrow.
*  Boom. Go right into the pump station.
*  You're like, oh, we did it. We did.
*  All the practice paid off.
*  And then then it's just about respecting the animal and finding the animal.
*  And, you know, and taking it apart and then eating it.
*  And when you're eating that animal, you're thinking when you're serving it
*  to your family and your friends, you're thinking about that moment.
*  You're thinking about the hard work that it took to to make that happen.
*  And it's all the more enjoyable.
*  Yeah. And that there is a switch.
*  There's a switch from what it's almost like relief and and happiness
*  a little bit that you performed as you have practiced for, you said, hours
*  and hours, hundreds of hours.
*  And then that arrow went right where it's supposed to.
*  And you know that that's going to result in a humane death for the animal.
*  So then you switch because we went from that
*  feeling good, smiling to then the death of the animals.
*  We walked up and it's a complete night and day difference.
*  Yeah, it was.
*  Then it was that that's where the respect came in.
*  And you're like, here's this dead animal.
*  And it's then that's you're not smiling.
*  No, you're not.
*  And for people who haven't been involved
*  and don't know what it's like to take the life of something.
*  I mean, everybody takes a life of something to live, as we just talked about.
*  But when you haven't done it firsthand, that can be hard to.
*  To understand.
*  Yeah, and I think our relationship with animals and food is skewed in this country
*  because people are so aware of the horrors of factory farming.
*  And you think about that.
*  And a lot of people, they equate that with eating meat.
*  And it's it's a really torturous and sick reality that that is how a lot of the food
*  in this in this country is that's how it's made.
*  Yeah, that's how it's grown.
*  That's how it's harvested.
*  It's these. But.
*  The difference between factory farming and hunting elk in the mountains
*  could not be further apart. Yeah, couldn't be further apart.
*  It couldn't. You shoot one out to eat it for a year.
*  It was. I mean, and the challenge, I think, especially what we do with the bow,
*  the challenge is what makes it so rewarding to me.
*  I remember my first hunt this year just a couple of weeks ago in Oregon.
*  It was 100, 100 degrees, 90 degrees, full moon.
*  The worst hunting conditions, you know, as people don't know,
*  but a full moon means animals are out feeding because they can see at night.
*  That means they're not out during the day.
*  And then the heat keeps them suppressed or activity suppressed.
*  The bulls weren't really running.
*  And my buddy who's a lineman, Kevin Akers, he's a lineman for PGE,
*  hardworking guy, manual labor.
*  We just love elk hunting.
*  He comes down every year to hunt with me just because we enjoy the challenge.
*  And he loves elk hunting.
*  And we're on day five.
*  And I remember he goes, he goes, I'm going to go hunting.
*  He goes, man, this is almost turning into a flirting with a grind,
*  a little bit of a grind on this hunt.
*  And I was just like, no, what?
*  I said, it's only day five, dude.
*  I said, I wish it was hotter.
*  I wish there was two moons.
*  And we were just having, you know, just joking around.
*  He's always always has a good attitude, too.
*  And it's just that challenge.
*  So then when you have overcome that and you say you wish it was hotter,
*  we'd quote Jaco all the time and he says, yeah, I wish it was hotter.
*  He goes, that'd make the water source more valuable.
*  Good, good.
*  Wanted to be hot.
*  So anyway, when you have that mindset and you got to keep pushing.
*  And on that hunt, I was just covering mile after mile after mile
*  looking for fresh sign because the elk weren't moving.
*  So I do, you know, 10, 13 miles a day just looking for fresh track.
*  And finally, we saw Ron Hofsis, who has logged down there forever.
*  He saw a fresh rub.
*  A bull had torn up a tree.
*  And that was a bull had moved.
*  So we were like, OK, all right.
*  Now we're on to something.
*  A bull had been here last night because it was from the rub.
*  Wasn't there the day before it was there.
*  So I'm like, there's a bull in here.
*  We're going to I'll find his track.
*  We're going to find where they are.
*  And we went through and sure enough,
*  that fifth evening of that hunt is when I got
*  saw there was a bull on the ridge bugling.
*  I'd actually funny.
*  I mean, we were going through blackberries and there was a bear
*  about 10 feet away and I had a bear tag, too.
*  And I look at the bear and it looked like a pretty good bear.
*  And I'm like, I know the bull was about 150 yards up the ridge.
*  And there's a couple of satellite bulls.
*  And I'm like, God, I could kill this bear as long as it doesn't death.
*  I'm really loud. I could go.
*  So I come to full draw on the bear and it like looks to the blackberries
*  at 10 feet away and sees me and takes off.
*  So I didn't I had to let up 10 feet away. 10 feet.
*  Yeah. He was like from us to Jamie.
*  I mean, right in the back, right there feeding because he was in the middle
*  of blackberries that's eating nothing but blackberries.
*  A product. Oh, it's so good.
*  It'd be so good.
*  And there's so I had a bear tag, a mountain lion tag, a deer tag and an elk tag.
*  So I'm like, I'm ready to make something happen.
*  Anyway, I was going to kill this bear, but he took off.
*  And so then I was focused back up on the bull and I get up there
*  and the bull hadn't bugled in a while, but I saw there was a spike
*  in a satellite bull on a cow.
*  And I take I look up over the blackberries up on top of the ridge
*  and I see his antlers and I was just like, Jesus, that's a big bull.
*  So I turn out to Kevin. He was behind me.
*  I go, giant bull.
*  He didn't really know what I said.
*  And I was just like, just stay here.
*  So I took off my boots and snuck up there and I was 55 yards from him.
*  And he was just laying there.
*  And I'm like, there's no way he's going to he's kind of facing quartering to me.
*  There's no way he's just going to stay here with this is a rut.
*  I mean, he's feeling that there's other bulls around here.
*  So I stayed there at 55 yards, range him a few times just to verify.
*  He ends up standing up and turning to face uphill.
*  I come back 55, hold perfect and hit him with a perfect arrow.
*  And he went 30 yards and was dead in seconds.
*  But so when you go from the point to all that was that whole challenge
*  of not seeing anything, sweating your ass off, covering
*  13 miles a day, looking for fresh sign when that cumulates in
*  a giant seven by six bull falling in 30 yards.
*  I mean, there's relief, happiness.
*  It's as you say, you've just achieved this this goal that I don't even know.
*  It's so hard to explain how difficult it is, but that's what people see.
*  So they see that.
*  And in context, you can't capture a week of hunting
*  and sweating your ass off and and being in the sun.
*  Also, you can't explain how many people fail at this.
*  Everyone 10 percent almost success rate.
*  Yeah, that's good hunters.
*  That's on any elk.
*  But you start talking about big bulls.
*  I mean, it's less than one percent, you know, of hunters,
*  especially bow hunting, bow hunting for big bulls.
*  And it's like.
*  So that it's hard not to feel happy, you know, but it's not.
*  It's not that you're happy with the death of the animal.
*  You're happy because you worked your ass off and you achieved a goal.
*  And that's that that would be anybody.
*  That would be anybody.
*  Now, when you transition to you walk up and the animal is dead,
*  then there's reverence, you know, and so there's there's that change.
*  And I think people do it just like, you know, now, because now you've done it.
*  But you can't blame people who haven't done it for not knowing.
*  No, and it's it's so hard when you watch
*  and if you ever watch a hunting television show, most of them.
*  I mean, there's a few that do a good job of sort of explaining,
*  capturing what it's like, but most of them don't.
*  There's a lot of flashing music and, you know, the kill shot and everybody
*  celebrating high fives and fist bump.
*  It's like, you don't know.
*  They don't know how you're seeing 22 minutes of something that probably took
*  many, many days. Yeah.
*  And a lot of struggle and so much training to get to that point
*  where you could pull that off. Yeah.
*  Both cardio, hill running, all the different things you have to do
*  and then shooting the bow constantly like with a rifle.
*  You can pick up a rifle and not having shot for years.
*  And as long as you understand the principles of shooting a gun correctly
*  and getting a surprise shot, you can if you're shooting off sticks,
*  you could put that crosshair on an animal and pull, pull, pull,
*  blam and shoot the animal. It can be done.
*  You know, I would recommend you practice, but you can pull it off. Yeah.
*  There's no fucking way you're going to be able to pull off a long shot
*  with a bow if you don't practice. You just can't do it. No.
*  And people who even practice every day fail because it's nerves.
*  Nerves are crazy. Nerves are a weird thing, man.
*  It's like it protects you because like, is that animal? I got to run.
*  Like like the like when you're in a situation where you need that adrenaline
*  because your body's got to get the fuck out of there and do superhuman things
*  as fast as you can. Right.
*  Then in a situation like elk hunting,
*  now you have to keep those nerves calm.
*  It's the weirdest thing for someone like especially.
*  I know I've like there's a few fighters that have gotten into bow hunting
*  and fighters are used to just in the moment, just fighting,
*  like moving quick and reacting. Right.
*  But bow hunting, you have to stay calm.
*  You have to keep your heart rate in check.
*  You have to be in the moment and just concentrate on the shot process
*  and don't get caught up in it. Don't don't let that anxiety get you.
*  That's hard. That's hard for people.
*  There's so many little mental games going on.
*  And there's and there's also not knowing exactly when to hurry,
*  when to slow down, which you can get away with.
*  You're reading the animal, you're reading their body language.
*  You don't know whether to to close
*  the gap between you and them quickly or it's time to be patient.
*  You don't know what the wind's going to do.
*  There's so many things.
*  That's why I always say like the better shape I'm in,
*  well, I can make better decisions on all those micro decisions.
*  Yeah. You know, and that's that's what leads ultimately to success.
*  It's not it's not running 10 miles a day,
*  but that plays into all better decisions a thousand times.
*  And there's I mean, I think that any really difficult thing
*  that you do in this life, it
*  it elevates your ability to do difficult things.
*  It elevates your your understanding of who you are as a person
*  and where you stand right now in this moment.
*  And there's very few of those things that also sustain you with food.
*  And this is the crazy combination.
*  What what bow hunting is? Yeah.
*  It's both a physical pursuit, a mental challenge and sustenance.
*  It's all these things together.
*  So powerful. An amazing combination.
*  Yeah. Changed my life.
*  It's really did. It's changed how I feel about food.
*  It's changed my relationship with meat, you know.
*  And that's why you offered to write the forward of my book. Yes.
*  I'm excited to do it.
*  I've already got ideas. I'll tell you after I'm done.
*  I don't want to tell you anything.
*  I just want you to read it when it's done.
*  OK, let's get the fuck out of here.
*  We're going hunting next week, buddy. I'm excited.
*  I can't wait. Utah. Yeah, we go.
*  All right. Goodbye, everybody.
*  Thank you. And keep hammering.
