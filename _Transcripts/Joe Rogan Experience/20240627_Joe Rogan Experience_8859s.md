# Joe Rogan Experience #2050 - Ehsan Ahmad
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6.0s)]
*  What's up brother? How you doing? Good to see you. Glad to be here. Glad to have you, finally man. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=10.0s)]
*  Dude, I was probably around, when was your first time on stage? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=19.0s)]
*  My first time on stage was in this place called Tommy T's in Livermore, California. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=23.0s)]
*  Oh, I know that place. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=30.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was an open mic at 2012, end of 2012, early 2013. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=31.0s)]
*  That's when I started and I remember going up on stage, my first joke kind of hit and I bombed the whole time. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=38.0s)]
*  But that one little hit was enough. It was enough. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=46.0s)]
*  Do you remember what it was? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=50.0s)]
*  Yeah, my name is Asana Maud and I know that's very 9-eleven-y. That was my opening line in comedy. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=51.0s)]
*  Wow. So I probably met you around 2014 then. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=59.0s)]
*  2015 is when we met. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=64.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=66.0s)]
*  Yeah, and this is a story I tell to all the door guys on what it's like to be a door guy at a comedy club. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=67.0s)]
*  Because this is the first time we've ever had a conversation. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=73.0s)]
*  I was sitting by the back door and you had just stopped and you just talked to all the new guys. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=75.0s)]
*  I've noticed that you do that. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=82.0s)]
*  And then you were showing me your phone and telling me your process and how you write and how you listen to every single set as you drove back home after the store. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=83.0s)]
*  And you talked to me for like 20 minutes and then you left and Curtis came up to me and was like, hey, so someone pooped in the bathroom and missed. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=91.0s)]
*  And I had to go clean it up and it was pure liquid. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=101.0s)]
*  It was pure liquid. Every time I kept wiping more would come in. It was unreal. Unreal. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=106.0s)]
*  And I told you, I tell all the door guys that's what it's like working at a comedy club. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=116.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=120.0s)]
*  Especially at a high level one. You get these really cool moments and then you also learn your place a little bit. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=121.0s)]
*  I didn't know door people have to clean shit. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=128.0s)]
*  Oh, really? Don't they have like a janitor or something? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=130.0s)]
*  Not during the night. This is what made it crazy. This was at like 730. It was like way too early to be pooping and missing. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=134.0s)]
*  Oh my God. There's something about bar poop. Poops when people are drinking. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=143.0s)]
*  It's just so chaotic. Like every time I've ever gone into like a bar bathroom and there's dudes in there shitting it's just like, oh my God, I can't wait to get out of here quick. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=148.0s)]
*  If you're shitting in a bar it's basically like, oh this is the last resort. I have no other options. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=158.0s)]
*  Nobody wants to do some fucking public shitting. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=162.0s)]
*  And it was back when the store in the hallway had the single bathrooms. So those were like extra gross. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=166.0s)]
*  Oh, those were a disaster. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=171.0s)]
*  Those were absolute nightmares. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=172.0s)]
*  Remember when like comics would be in that one little bathroom and then there'd be the staircase up there so people would be talking shit to you while you're in the bathroom? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=176.0s)]
*  No, I never had that experience at the store. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=185.0s)]
*  Yeah, you know the stairs to the belly room? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=187.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=190.0s)]
*  You know where that is? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=191.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=192.0s)]
*  Like there's a window right there for the bathroom the comics always use. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=193.0s)]
*  Oh, there is. There is. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=196.0s)]
*  So guys would be talking shit while other guys are shitting. They just rag it out of yelling in the window. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=197.0s)]
*  That back parking lot, before they invented sacred grounds and before they had the back bar, that was where we'd all hang out. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=204.0s)]
*  But the problem is you'd get randoms from that little back area that would come and they would come and interrupt a conversation and get in the way. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=213.0s)]
*  We had a place where we could just chill by ourselves. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=222.0s)]
*  Right, right. And then by the time I had gotten there, you had just gotten back. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=225.0s)]
*  And so for you to hang out, it would really be interesting to watch as a door guy because you'd have to watch people would be like making game plans to talk to you. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=228.0s)]
*  You could see them like, okay, if I do this and I do this and I do this and you have to just tell people like, hey, maybe you should go hang out in the patio or something like that. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=237.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=243.0s)]
*  It sucks because you want to say hi to everybody. But also, my friends are there. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=244.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=249.0s)]
*  I see them every now and again, especially if it's like someone like Burr that I only see like once a month. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=250.0s)]
*  When you see them, you're like, this is an important time. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=255.0s)]
*  Well, and it's like when you're in a place with other comics like that, it just feels like home. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=258.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=263.0s)]
*  You know, so it's like, oh, I want to hang out at home. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=264.0s)]
*  And we talk about this all the time about the mothership. That green room is our clubhouse. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=266.0s)]
*  I live there. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=271.0s)]
*  It's so fun. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=272.0s)]
*  I practically live there. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=273.0s)]
*  Last night was so fun. It was so and they're always fun. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=274.0s)]
*  Like every night we're there. We just have so much fun just on stage and also in the green room watching each other's new jokes and shit. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=278.0s)]
*  Well, talking about comedy and the green room itself is just such a comedy place. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=287.0s)]
*  You have Lenny Bruce's mic, Mae West's couch, Joey Diaz's words, Rodney Dingerfield's notes. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=291.0s)]
*  Handwritten notes. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=297.0s)]
*  It is like a place where I feel like, oh, I'm in it. I'm inspired. It's the best place in the world, I think. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=298.0s)]
*  I think so, too. I mean, we were talking about what we hoped it would be and what it is. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=307.0s)]
*  I don't even know if I I don't think I ever hoped it would be this good. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=312.0s)]
*  I mean, the club's not even a year in. I think we're only just sort of at the start of what it can be. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=315.0s)]
*  And we have like six hundred and sixty thousand Instagram followers already. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=322.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=326.0s)]
*  It's sold out every night. It's just it's crazy. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=327.0s)]
*  And now that Gillis is here and Shane moved here, McCusker is here and you know, and we've got Ari and we've got I mean, Ari's been coming down a lot. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=330.0s)]
*  We're doing another Protect Our Parks. Trying to get that motherfucker to move here. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=340.0s)]
*  Sam Talon, I think, is moving here. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=343.0s)]
*  Yes, he wants to move here. Right. It is incredible. It's incredible. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=345.0s)]
*  It is the right place to be at the right time. I felt very lucky in my life. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=349.0s)]
*  I feel like everywhere I've been, I've been at the right place in the right time. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=353.0s)]
*  Yeah, if you make the most out of things, that's what happens most of the time. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=356.0s)]
*  I mean, obviously, horrible things go wrong for good people. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=360.0s)]
*  But the reality is that like every time something happens in your life, it gives you an opportunity to figure it out. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=364.0s)]
*  OK, where do I go now? What is it? And 9-Eleven or excuse me, 9-Eleven, the new 9-Eleven, the COVID. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=371.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=378.0s)]
*  Then that, you know, like there's this monumental shifts in culture and society. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=379.0s)]
*  9-Eleven was a big one, obviously. The COVID was a big one, too, man. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=384.0s)]
*  It shifted a lot of things. It destroyed people's belief in mainstream media. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=387.0s)]
*  It made people completely distrust the government and their regulations [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=392.0s)]
*  and their wisdom behind closing this and closing that and forcing this and forcing that. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=396.0s)]
*  And it made everybody just go, man, where where the fuck am I going? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=401.0s)]
*  Because this is not what I used to live in anymore. This is a different place now. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=406.0s)]
*  Right. And all that happened. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=410.0s)]
*  We come to Austin and then I'm like, I got to open up a club. I have to. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=413.0s)]
*  Like, there's no real like fucking comedy store thing here. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=417.0s)]
*  And there were so many of us already here. You were already here. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=421.0s)]
*  Simpson was already here. Derek was already here. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=425.0s)]
*  It's like a bunch of fucking scouts went out early with fucking cold camping and teepees and shit. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=428.0s)]
*  It was it was wild. It was wild. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=435.0s)]
*  The first the first door guy that moved out here was a funny dude, regular at the mothership named Dylan Sullivan. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=438.0s)]
*  Yeah, very funny dude. Yeah. He got on a Discord call with me. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=444.0s)]
*  I was in California. We were in the midst of the second lockdown, which was brutal. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=449.0s)]
*  And he goes, you got to come out here. There's stage time indoors. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=453.0s)]
*  Just the proof is that to perform indoors, it was like you it was like drinking water after being in a desert for two years. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=461.0s)]
*  It was like a speakeasy because you knew you couldn't do it everywhere. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=467.0s)]
*  No. And there were still those rules where you had to walk in with the masks. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=471.0s)]
*  Yeah. That was still here. And so I get taken off once you start laughing. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=474.0s)]
*  You fucking spray in COVID. This poor guy, whoever you are in the front row last night, I'm so sorry. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=478.0s)]
*  I accidentally spit on you twice. You know, when you're punctuating your words and I'm seeing this guy going like this, I wanted to address it. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=485.0s)]
*  But I didn't want to stop the bit. So if you're out there, buddy, I'm sorry I spit on you. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=492.0s)]
*  I hit him twice. I remember one time I was opening a show of Fat Man and I was eating. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=496.0s)]
*  I was eating it like it was bad. And then I spit. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=501.0s)]
*  But when you're eating it, everyone just watching you. So the whole audience sees me just spit on the guy in the front row. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=504.0s)]
*  I've been spit on before. I've been in the front row. It's like when people, Joey Diaz will spit on you like crazy. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=510.0s)]
*  It's like when someone's on stage, they don't mean to. Sorry. Right. It really means that we're into it. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=517.0s)]
*  Yeah, we're just going hard. Right. You know, or bombing. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=523.0s)]
*  Yeah, and trying to save ourselves. Trying to save yourself is the saddest fucking moment of your life. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=526.0s)]
*  Then it comes a point where you have to be like, all right, I'm not going to ask what they do for work. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=532.0s)]
*  I'm just going to live in the bomb. I'm just going to live in it. I deserve this. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=536.0s)]
*  Well, you need a bunch of bombs to figure out how to bomb. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=539.0s)]
*  You know, and I've seen some people pull out of bombs. That's some of the most impressive shit of all time. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=542.0s)]
*  When someone starts bombing and then they hit and then they get their confidence back and then they got a banger. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=547.0s)]
*  And then everybody, OK, OK, maybe the first joke sucked, but we're on board now. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=552.0s)]
*  It's a really good feeling, especially because I open all these shows, right? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=556.0s)]
*  Is that when you get on, when I get on stage and that first joke doesn't hit and then it's like, ooh, all right, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=560.0s)]
*  I'm going to stay in the pocket and I'm going to figure this out. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=567.0s)]
*  And by the end of it, you're like, this is going to be a good show. That's a great feeling. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=569.0s)]
*  Most certainly you have the hardest job. The hardest job is the audience is cold. That's the hardest job. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=573.0s)]
*  The easiest job is like second or third. And then the second hardest job is going on last. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=578.0s)]
*  Right. But the hardest job is most certainly going on first. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=583.0s)]
*  Well, some of them do, especially your show specifically. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=586.0s)]
*  A lot of them are here from the podcast and they don't know stand up like that. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=589.0s)]
*  So they'll come, they'll come and they'll look at you like, wait, you're not a podcast. Joe's not talking to you. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=594.0s)]
*  Oh, no. They have they have that vibe to them. Sometimes they have to be like, no, no, this is what it is. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=599.0s)]
*  That's nice to get down. Fear factor. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=603.0s)]
*  Come to see me because they recognize me from fear factor. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=605.0s)]
*  And they want I love that guy. That shows great. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=609.0s)]
*  And then they go and I'd be talking about the pyramids being built. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=612.0s)]
*  And they're like, there's no animal dicks. Where are the animal? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=615.0s)]
*  This guy talking about and then I would make fun of fear factor too. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=617.0s)]
*  You know, but that was, you know, it was like that show. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=623.0s)]
*  When I think about it today, like, what the fuck were they thinking? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=628.0s)]
*  It was it was a thing. It was a real I remember was sitting down with my parents and we would watch fear factor. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=631.0s)]
*  That would be a family thing. Yeah, I never watched it. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=637.0s)]
*  Well, I watched it once and I threw up at home. Really? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=640.0s)]
*  I never threw up on the show. Yeah, that's that seems weird. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=644.0s)]
*  I threw up at home once because I didn't expect to be so grossed out. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=647.0s)]
*  I wasn't prepared, I guess, like on the show, I was always prepared to not throw up. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=650.0s)]
*  And there's no close up angles when you're there. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=654.0s)]
*  This lady was eating worms and she threw it up back in her glass and then started eating it again. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=657.0s)]
*  And I went, oh, that's a level of competitiveness that I don't know if I have. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=663.0s)]
*  Oh, man. People would go for it. They would fucking go for it. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=671.0s)]
*  Worms are rough because worms are filled with dirt. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=674.0s)]
*  They eat dirt, eat dirt and mushiness. It's fucking gross. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=676.0s)]
*  What was it? It was just it was a cash prize at the end. What was it? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=679.0s)]
*  Yeah, but you had a lot of people were going to eat some dick and never get a cash prize. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=683.0s)]
*  That's the problem. It's like one person is getting the money. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=687.0s)]
*  But you also like you had it like Michael Yeoh took it and became a comedian. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=691.0s)]
*  He was on Fear Factor? Michael Yeoh was on episode one, season one of Fear Factor. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=697.0s)]
*  No way. Yes. That is just figuring his life out. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=703.0s)]
*  He was a young guy. He was really jacked back then. He was a big dude and fucking super nice guy. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=708.0s)]
*  We stayed friends and then he became a DJ. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=713.0s)]
*  He was I knew he did a he did a like a morning radio show for a while and he starts doing stand up. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=716.0s)]
*  And then he comes to L.A. I'm like, dude, you fucking you actually did it. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=722.0s)]
*  You're an actual professional. He's got specials. He's a real headliner. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=726.0s)]
*  I'm like, fuck him. Right. He sells out. He sells out. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=729.0s)]
*  Knowing him from like episode one of Fear Factor is crazy. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=733.0s)]
*  That's Michael Yeoh. That's me and Michael Yeoh. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=737.0s)]
*  Holy shit. Episode one. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=739.0s)]
*  Damn. Bro, I still had the wallet chain back then. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=742.0s)]
*  I still had hair. Yeah, I was going to say the hair. The hairline's going. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=746.0s)]
*  When did you shave it? I shaved. I gave up I think in 2011. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=749.0s)]
*  I just was like, this shit is just fucking done. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=755.0s)]
*  There's always yeah, there's always like for me it was a I saw a picture of me on stage and I was like, oh my God, this is how I present myself to the world. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=760.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're so much better off giving it and I'm lucky I have a good head. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=767.0s)]
*  It's a good shape for head for being bald. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=772.0s)]
*  I swear to God, if I could grow hair, I would still shave my head because it's the easiest thing in the world. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=774.0s)]
*  I just every two or three days I just go. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=779.0s)]
*  It takes five minutes. Oh, you go electric. I still have a razor. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=784.0s)]
*  I use a razor. Oh, damn. I have this. It's like this little ATV that fits on your finger. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=787.0s)]
*  It's like the ATX razor. You just glide it along your head. Yeah. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=792.0s)]
*  Yeah, I enjoy that. I don't know. That does sound nice. I feel like a little. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=796.0s)]
*  I got a lot of scars, though, of a hair transplant scar. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=800.0s)]
*  And I've got a lot of scars from being a dumb kid like a giant fucking gash on my head for when this crane that lifts cinder blocks fell and hit me in the side of the head. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=803.0s)]
*  Yeah, we were kids were hanging around in this yard where they had like, you know, these giant like sewer sized cement tubes. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=815.0s)]
*  Right. And they had these cranes that would pick these things up. Okay. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=828.0s)]
*  And we were fucking around and I don't know what happened, but something fell and clang me off the back of the head. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=832.0s)]
*  And I thought I was dead. Holy shit. Yeah. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=840.0s)]
*  I had to get taken to the hospital. And I remember thinking I was dead. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=843.0s)]
*  Like something felt so wrong that I remember telling my mom, I'm worried I'm going to die. Yeah, I got dinged. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=847.0s)]
*  I mean, I do not remember what happened. I remember something fell and something hit me in the head. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=855.0s)]
*  And I grayed out to like almost total unconsciousness and then came back. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=860.0s)]
*  But I felt so bad. I felt like it was so wrong. Right. I had to go to the hospital. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=866.0s)]
*  I thought I was going to die. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=872.0s)]
*  I would probably change the course of your life too. Right. That's a traumatic head injury when you're young. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=874.0s)]
*  I've had a ton of those though. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=878.0s)]
*  I guarantee a lot of my impulsiveness and my craziness. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=881.0s)]
*  Some of it has to do with brain damage. It has to. Right. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=888.0s)]
*  If you just look at the data for former fighters and football players and even soccer players, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=892.0s)]
*  which you wouldn't think get head injuries, but they hit the ball all the time. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=900.0s)]
*  And sometimes they collide with each other too. That can happen too. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=905.0s)]
*  You know, I've had head injuries from collisions in jujitsu, just accidental collisions. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=908.0s)]
*  Like someone will knee you in the face accidentally and fucking ring your bell. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=913.0s)]
*  And guys have gotten knocked out in the gym totally accidentally. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=917.0s)]
*  You just use zig when you shoot a zag. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=921.0s)]
*  A guy's moving towards you and you're moving towards him and your chin collides with the top of his head [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=923.0s)]
*  and you just go unconscious. Happens. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=927.0s)]
*  Yeah. So I've been, I don't know how many concussions I've had in my life. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=930.0s)]
*  Oh really? You have no idea. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=935.0s)]
*  From the time I was 15 till I was 21, I sparred a lot. I did a lot of sparring. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=937.0s)]
*  And when I really started getting fucked up was when I started kickboxing sparring. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=943.0s)]
*  Because I wasn't good at boxing. I was a good kicker because I was like a Taekwondo champion. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=948.0s)]
*  And then I went into kickboxing and I'm like, oh my God, these guys are fucking me up. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=952.0s)]
*  I was getting beat up by good boxers. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=955.0s)]
*  Are you taking kicks to the face? [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=957.0s)]
*  No. I'd fucked them up with kicks. If I get in kick distance, I was much better than them. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=958.0s)]
*  But the thing with kickboxing is there's boxing involved and my boxing was terrible. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=963.0s)]
*  I was just learning boxing. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=967.0s)]
*  I had a very delusional idea of how good I could use my hands because I was good at Taekwondo. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=969.0s)]
*  And Taekwondo has some punches, but not much. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=973.0s)]
*  I knew how to punch things hard, but I didn't really know how to box at all. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=975.0s)]
*  Like the defensive positions and all that sort of stuff. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=979.0s)]
*  So once I started kickboxing, I really started getting beat up. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=982.0s)]
*  And I went through a couple of years from like, I think I started in like 19, I started transitioning into kickboxing. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=984.0s)]
*  And from 19 to 21 was when I did most of my really hard sparring. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=991.0s)]
*  Those were horrible days where I'd be sitting in my apartment. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=996.0s)]
*  Okay, I'm 20 years old. I'm completely broke. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=999.0s)]
*  I deliver newspapers in the morning and I work for a private investigator in the afternoon. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1002.0s)]
*  You work for a private investigator? [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1008.0s)]
*  I guess I was 21 by then. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1010.0s)]
*  So were you like tracking like husbands cheating on wives pretty much? [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1011.0s)]
*  It was mostly insurance scams. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1015.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1016.0s)]
*  Most of that was insurance scams. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1017.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1018.0s)]
*  Most of it was people would say that they got a back injury and they couldn't work so they were getting money. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1019.0s)]
*  But then they would go and work another job. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1024.0s)]
*  And then you're following them around? [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1026.0s)]
*  Yeah. It's like a lot of dumb people. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1027.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1029.0s)]
*  Well, just a lot of scammers that thought they were being slick and we bust them. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1030.0s)]
*  But one lady, oh, it was the saddest fucking thing. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1033.0s)]
*  The guy I worked for, by the way, his name was Dave Dolan. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1036.0s)]
*  And he would call himself Dynamite Dickless Dave Dolan. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1039.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1041.0s)]
*  He was one of the funniest guys I have ever met in my life. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1042.0s)]
*  A natural comedian. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1045.0s)]
*  Oh, there's so many people in your life like that. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1046.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1049.0s)]
*  Damn, you were the funniest person I've ever met. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1050.0s)]
*  And the craziest thing is by chance that dude was cousins with the dude who owned the comedy connection, Billy Downs. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1052.0s)]
*  Billy Downs is his cousin. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1059.0s)]
*  So I found an ad for a private investigator's assistant. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1060.0s)]
*  I was trying to figure out jobs that I could do to make money while I was trying to do stand-up. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1065.0s)]
*  And so I found this job. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1068.0s)]
*  I go, that would be fun. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1070.0s)]
*  Private investigator's assistant. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1071.0s)]
*  What it really was, the dude lost his license from a DUI and he needed someone to drive him around. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1073.0s)]
*  And that was Dave. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1079.0s)]
*  But I was kind of his assistant. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1080.0s)]
*  So like what kind of would happen like one time, it made me really sad. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1082.0s)]
*  The scam would be. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1086.0s)]
*  So say if someone was doing something that you knew was illegal. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1087.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1091.0s)]
*  Right. And you had to catch them. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1092.0s)]
*  The scam would be you would write their license plate on a piece of paper with several license plates that are very similar to it, very close. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1093.0s)]
*  And so then Dave would go to the door and say, hey, I'm so sorry to bother you, ma'am, but I'm not even supposed to have this information. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1102.0s)]
*  But a friend of mine works for the police department. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1111.0s)]
*  My girlfriend was in a car accident and there was a witness to this hit and run and they wrote down the witness's license plate. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1113.0s)]
*  But then a cop spilled coffee on the paper. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1119.0s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1122.0s)]
*  Is your girlfriend OK? [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1123.0s)]
*  Well, she had an injury to, you know, L5 and L6. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1124.0s)]
*  And then this lady goes, oh, I had the same injury. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1128.0s)]
*  And then he goes, oh, no kidding. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1132.0s)]
*  Are you OK now? [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1134.0s)]
*  And she goes, yes. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1135.0s)]
*  Well, I got, you know, I got the insurance. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1136.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1139.0s)]
*  It was all you're getting compensated for. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1140.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1141.0s)]
*  And I also work another job. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1142.0s)]
*  So I'm getting to work while I'm getting the insurance money. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1144.0s)]
*  Oh, good for them. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1147.0s)]
*  Good for you. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1148.0s)]
*  Fuck them. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1149.0s)]
*  She was. Would you like to come in and have a cup of coffee? [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1150.0s)]
*  So this lady lets this random private guy who says he's a private person in just this is how people were in the 1980s. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1152.0s)]
*  Yeah, this doesn't seem like this would happen today at all. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1162.0s)]
*  Let you in the house. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1164.0s)]
*  They just let this. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1165.0s)]
*  So this was I was 21. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1166.0s)]
*  So this is 88. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1167.0s)]
*  So this lady just let us in the house. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1169.0s)]
*  We sit down in our kitchen. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1171.0s)]
*  She's so nice. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1172.0s)]
*  She makes us coffee and she starts telling about how she's working for the airlines and she got hurt. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1173.0s)]
*  But then she filed an insurance claim and now she's working under her maiden name. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1179.0s)]
*  And she tells the whole thing to just lays out the whole story. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1184.0s)]
*  I hope they catch whoever hit your girlfriend and the whole deal. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1188.0s)]
*  And thank you very much, ma'am. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1191.0s)]
*  I really appreciate it. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1192.0s)]
*  Thank you for the coffee. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1193.0s)]

*  She's trying to skin. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1207.0s)]
*  She's a nice lady. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1208.0s)]
*  She invited us in for coffee. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1209.0s)]
*  He's like, fuck her. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1210.0s)]
*  Fuck her. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1211.0s)]
*  Turned her in. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1212.0s)]
*  Turned her in, of course. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1213.0s)]
*  Insurance companies are ruthless. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1214.0s)]
*  Oh, well, you know, I guess that's his job. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1215.0s)]
*  And she is kind of she was kind of a criminal. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1219.0s)]
*  But she you know, it's like people think that that when people don't have any. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1222.0s)]
*  People don't have anything in life. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1226.0s)]
*  You know, they just fucking never, never really get ahead. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1228.0s)]
*  They're always bill to bill, check to check, barely getting by. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1231.0s)]
*  And then you have this opportunity where you could work and still get you from the insurance [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1236.0s)]
*  companies. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1240.0s)]
*  Fuck them. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1241.0s)]

*  Fuck them. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1243.0s)]
*  You just figure out just just get a little money on the side. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1244.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1247.0s)]
*  I'm using my maiden name. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1248.0s)]
*  Who's going to catch me? [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1249.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1250.0s)]
*  You know, I don't I don't mind the the grift. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1251.0s)]
*  It's like, you know, get your money. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1253.0s)]
*  You get your money, but you can't just be telling random people that I know and letting [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1255.0s)]
*  us in her house. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1258.0s)]
*  That's so wild. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1259.0s)]
*  And it's so funny. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1260.0s)]
*  I was thinking like, wow, that would never happen today. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1261.0s)]
*  But like now we would just that the same person would tell some random person in D.M. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1262.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's like they'll find that people will find a way to let people in. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1266.0s)]
*  That made me sad. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1271.0s)]
*  But most of the time was busting dudes and most of the time was busting dudes who pretend [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1272.0s)]
*  they had a bad back and then you watch them carry a load of shingles on the ladder. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1276.0s)]
*  They were working as roofers on the side. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1282.0s)]
*  Like we busted a lot of dudes. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1284.0s)]
*  One guy he busted his girlfriend was getting she's having an affair with a bodybuilder. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1287.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1293.0s)]
*  And he this guy wanted Dave to get pictures. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1294.0s)]
*  So Dave had to get pictures of this bodybuilder banging this girl. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1298.0s)]
*  And so he gets the pictures. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1303.0s)]
*  He was like, look, buddy, she's cheating on you. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1304.0s)]
*  He's like, OK, I want you to follow and get more pictures. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1306.0s)]
*  He was listening. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1309.0s)]
*  You fucking freak. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1310.0s)]
*  Yeah. Was he getting off on the. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1311.0s)]
*  I'm not. Yeah. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1312.0s)]
*  It was something about it. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1313.0s)]
*  And he goes, I told the guy, listen, you fucking freak. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1314.0s)]
*  You wanted me to get pictures. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1316.0s)]
*  I got your pictures. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1317.0s)]
*  We're done. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1318.0s)]
*  We're done. I'm not. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1320.0s)]
*  I'm not going to be your fucking pornographer for cuck porn. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1321.0s)]
*  The whole thing felt set up. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1325.0s)]
*  But Dave was so funny, man. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1326.0s)]
*  Like some of the best times I had was driving that guy around and doing this, because also [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1329.0s)]
*  we'd be really tired because a lot of it you'd have to do really early in the morning [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1334.0s)]
*  because you'd have to catch these folks when they got to work. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1337.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1340.0s)]
*  And you'd have to get to get outside their house down the street at like 430 a.m. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1341.0s)]
*  because they leave at like 530 and they go to some construction job or something. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1346.0s)]
*  So you have to bust them. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1350.0s)]
*  And so we'd be just sitting there talking shit, drinking coffee. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1352.0s)]
*  And he was so funny. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1354.0s)]
*  He would tell me about his story. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1356.0s)]
*  He just quit drinking like that. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1357.0s)]
*  He got in a car accident in like a in a tunnel, I think, and he had abandoned his car. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1359.0s)]
*  He took off and the cops got him. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1365.0s)]
*  They hit him with the DUI. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1367.0s)]
*  He couldn't drive for X amount of months, the whole deal. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1369.0s)]
*  And then he just said, that was it. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1371.0s)]
*  I realized I got to stop drinking right then and there. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1373.0s)]
*  He never went to a program. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1376.0s)]
*  He didn't do Alcoholics Anonymous. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1378.0s)]
*  He just quit. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1379.0s)]
*  He just quit. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1380.0s)]
*  Dude was so funny, man. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1381.0s)]
*  And I told him, I go, why don't you do stand up? [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1383.0s)]
*  Like your cousin owns the comedy club. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1385.0s)]
*  Just do an open mic night. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1387.0s)]
*  He was not interested. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1389.0s)]
*  No, you got to. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1391.0s)]
*  This is something that you have to want to do. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1392.0s)]
*  Yeah, you got to want it. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1394.0s)]
*  You really got to want it because it's so brutal if you don't. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1395.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1397.0s)]
*  You see some people like going through the motions and it's like, don't do this to yourself. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1398.0s)]
*  Well, it's not a thing you can kind of half in half out. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1402.0s)]
*  We've seen that a bunch of times. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1405.0s)]
*  Right. Yeah. You have to be fully in. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1407.0s)]
*  I remember thinking, you know, just like podcasts early on in my career being like, [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1409.0s)]
*  I have hearing everyone be like, no backup plan, no backup plan. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1416.0s)]
*  Just go all in. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1420.0s)]
*  And I remember like telling my parents who, you know, trying to figure out like, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1421.0s)]
*  what the fuck are you doing? [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1424.0s)]
*  Why are you doing this? [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1426.0s)]
*  And then I was like, at least go to like grad school and get and so you have something to fall back on. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1428.0s)]
*  And I was like, I can't. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1433.0s)]
*  I can't have a backup plan. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1434.0s)]
*  Well, one of the things we really wanted to do when we started the mothership, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1436.0s)]
*  you know, and you and I talked about this, we all talked about this, [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1440.0s)]
*  was have a real program, like a real solid open mic program. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1443.0s)]
*  And the best way to do that is obviously have a lot of open mic time. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1447.0s)]
*  So there's two nights a week. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1450.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1451.0s)]
*  Every Monday and every Monday we have open mic where anybody can go on stage and try it. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1452.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1458.0s)]
*  And you're going to be able to see all the different levels. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1459.0s)]
*  People have been doing open mics for four months, six months, folks who've been doing it a year, [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1462.0s)]
*  guys who are coming in that are pros that are going to drop in and do a set. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1467.0s)]
*  And you're getting to see the door people do their sets. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1470.0s)]
*  And the door people here are what I love about the people here in Austin is that, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1474.0s)]
*  you know, you don't run into the sort of people in L.A. who you would run into that, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1481.0s)]
*  like, they're just really doing this to become a writer or they're just really doing this to become an actor. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1485.0s)]
*  Right. So this is just something that you know. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1488.0s)]
*  The door people here like want to be stand up comedians. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1490.0s)]
*  They're fans of the art form. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1493.0s)]
*  They're fans of the art form and they are taking this opportunity [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1494.0s)]
*  and the amount that they're improving that I can see is incredible. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1498.0s)]
*  I'll look at some of the door guys and be like, I wasn't like that at five years in. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1503.0s)]
*  Mmm. Yeah. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1506.0s)]
*  I wasn't like, I wasn't doing that. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1507.0s)]
*  Well, we all feed off of each other. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1509.0s)]
*  And we were talking about Shane moving into town the other night. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1511.0s)]
*  And you guys were talking about his new half hour. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1514.0s)]
*  And like you and Tony had the same reaction. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1516.0s)]
*  You went back home and you started writing. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1518.0s)]
*  Started writing. Immediately started writing. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1520.0s)]
*  I went to Wisconsin recently and I took one of the door guys, CJ Landrieu with me. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1522.0s)]
*  And one of the reasons I took him with me is I did a random show with him in Dallas. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1529.0s)]
*  Like this is last year, 1230. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1533.0s)]
*  Just a horrible show at like midnight. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1536.0s)]
*  And he buried me. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1538.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1540.0s)]
*  He buried me. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1541.0s)]
*  And I was like, oh, if when I get the chance, you're going to go on the road with me [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1542.0s)]
*  because I have to follow this. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1545.0s)]
*  Mmm. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1546.0s)]

*  And then I was like, wow, I got buried by a door guy. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1550.0s)]
*  Oh, I got to, I got to, you know, it's like the energy around the place. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1552.0s)]

*  Yeah, I get what this is. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1745.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1747.0s)]
*  Yeah, we did it. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1748.0s)]
*  It's so funny because it was when we were all talking about it, we're in the green room [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1749.0s)]
*  of the Vulcan talking about how to build it, what we're going to do. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1755.0s)]
*  It all seemed like, is this really going to happen? [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1759.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1762.0s)]
*  You know, I could tell like some people were skeptical. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1763.0s)]
*  I mean, you would hear all the time people being like, they're not going to make the [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1764.0s)]
*  club. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1768.0s)]
*  What are you doing out there? [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1769.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1770.0s)]
*  They're not going to make the club. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1771.0s)]
*  And I always viewed it as a low risk, high reward move because I was so right before [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1772.0s)]
*  the pandemic hit is when I went full time pandemic hit, obviously not going out. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1779.4s)]
*  So I moved back in with my parents. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1783.64s)]
*  I'm living there because I'm not playing L.A. prices if I'm not going to do anything on [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1785.68s)]
*  stage and then they live in the Bay Area. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1788.8s)]
*  I was doing outdoor shows. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1791.0s)]
*  Dylan hits me up. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1793.2399999999998s)]
*  Hey, you got to move. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1794.2399999999998s)]
*  Derek, Jeffrey Burner also had moved here before me. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1795.2399999999998s)]
*  They're like, you got to come. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1798.2399999999998s)]
*  So I stayed on. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1799.2399999999998s)]
*  I stayed in their place for a little bit, two weeks. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1800.2399999999998s)]
*  And I was like, I got to come. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1802.2399999999998s)]
*  I got to come because at the worst I come out here and get stage time in front of people. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1803.2399999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1808.2399999999998s)]
*  At the worst. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1809.2399999999998s)]
*  When you first came here, was I even talking about opening a club yet? [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1810.2399999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1813.2399999999998s)]
*  So for me, what made it real that you were opening the club is that I heard Adam and Curtis [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1814.2399999999998s)]
*  were coming over. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1820.6s)]
*  Oh, he's serious about opening the club. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1822.08s)]
*  There's no like, there's no like, because you heard, I heard the news and I was like, [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1824.08s)]
*  oh, am I going to have to move to Austin? [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1827.7199999999998s)]
*  And then you hired those two and I was like, oh, this is happening. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1828.7199999999998s)]
*  And then my friends were also be like, hey, you got to come out here. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1831.36s)]
*  There is time and you can get good out here. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1834.6s)]
*  Well, everybody was, it was a perfect storm of L.A. closing down, the comedy store, they're [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1836.52s)]
*  closed down. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1842.0s)]
*  So everyone's out of work. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1843.0s)]
*  So all those people didn't have jobs anymore. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1844.0s)]
*  And so I said, I'll hire you now. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1845.6s)]
*  And you don't have a job for like a year and a half, but you start getting paid immediately. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1848.48s)]
*  That's a good deal. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1851.76s)]
*  Well, I was like, listen, man, I'm going to make it as nice and easy as possible. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1852.76s)]
*  I was like, come to Austin, get, enjoy the city for a year and then we'll call for you. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1856.84s)]
*  And then we'll do this. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1863.3600000000001s)]
*  We'll really do this. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1864.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1865.3600000000001s)]
*  And then it was, and then it opened and you could just feel it immediately. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1866.3600000000001s)]
*  I didn't think it was going to take as long as it took, but that was because we had another [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1868.6s)]
*  building and the building owned by the cult and that that shit fell apart. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1871.52s)]
*  But lucky it fell apart, man, because it's like where we got is the best spot in the [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1875.76s)]
*  world. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1879.8s)]
*  That sixth street is like no other place, man. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1880.8s)]
*  It's just hop in with people. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1883.84s)]
*  They close it down to car traffic and there's just people walk on the streets and the energy [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1886.28s)]
*  is crazy. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1890.74s)]
*  Right. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1891.74s)]
*  It's pretty, the energy at sixth street is nuts. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1892.74s)]
*  It is wild. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1894.28s)]
*  But it helps the show, man. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1895.28s)]
*  It's like there's so much wild shit going on outside that when you can, you hear there's [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1897.28s)]
*  live music playing everywhere. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1901.62s)]
*  There's like a feeling in the air. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1903.3s)]
*  And then you go to the club and it's rocking. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1906.1s)]
*  It's like, oh shit, this is the spot. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1907.8999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1911.1399999999999s)]
*  It just feels like a place that's just connected with everything. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1912.1399999999999s)]
*  It's just different than any other place we've ever been to. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1915.6999999999998s)]
*  But it's also the only place that I've ever worked at where a comic ran it, like a comic [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1918.3s)]
*  building and they built it just for comedy. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1924.6999999999998s)]
*  There's no business partners or fucking weird money people that want you to charge more [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1927.42s)]
*  for that or pay the comics less or make our own rules. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1933.0600000000002s)]
*  It's what they talk about the stories of like a comics playground. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1937.46s)]
*  It's an artist playground. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1940.8200000000002s)]
*  Like here you can take chances. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1941.8200000000002s)]
*  You can really be free artistically. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1944.9s)]
*  What I like about the sort of theory I have is, because I started in San Diego, which [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1947.8400000000001s)]
*  is a pretty red city in a blue state and now we're in a blue city in a red state. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1951.42s)]
*  That's sort of the best mix for comedy. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1955.1000000000001s)]
*  You get all sorts of people all across the spectrum. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1957.3s)]
*  This is what America really is. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1961.94s)]
*  There's people who believe this, people who believe this. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1963.1s)]
*  They're all in one place. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1965.02s)]
*  Can you make all of them laugh at once? [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1966.02s)]
*  It's also people that recognize there's a new scene here. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1969.22s)]
*  So there's like this energy to that and they want to come experience it. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1973.6599999999999s)]
*  Because there really haven't been, like Austin had a scene. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1978.3s)]
*  It had a small scene. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1981.22s)]
*  There was always some good comics that came out of Austin. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1982.5s)]
*  Because like Hicks was here for a while and there's like a history of good comedy out [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1986.46s)]
*  of Austin. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1990.8999999999999s)]
*  But it didn't have like a community like we have now. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1992.06s)]
*  There's nothing like it where all these world class comedians had moved to a city. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=1996.5s)]
*  That never really happened before. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2000.98s)]
*  It just kind of became an A city. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2002.8999999999999s)]
*  The only time it really happened I feel like is when Carson moved to LA. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2004.5s)]
*  Well I bet LA had comics already though, no? [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2009.18s)]
*  I mean I'd imagine so. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2013.34s)]
*  But then you hear like, I guess my view is the view of the comedy store's history. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2015.46s)]
*  But you know, all these people came from, all these high level comics came from New [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2021.18s)]
*  York right? [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2024.7s)]
*  It's like Letterman, Leno. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2025.7s)]
*  When Carson moved to LA. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2026.7s)]
*  Yeah yeah. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2027.7s)]
*  Really? [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2028.7s)]
*  I think the Tonight Show being in LA was a big monumental shift in people being like, [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2029.7s)]
*  oh let me come here. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2032.6200000000001s)]
*  Well that was back in the time where a spot on the Tonight Show could make your career. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2033.6200000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2038.5s)]
*  Like that's when I first saw Richard Jenney. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2039.5s)]
*  I was like wow, who's this guy? [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2040.5s)]
*  He did a spot on the Tonight Show and you would get these like 5 to 7 minute spots and [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2043.6999999999998s)]
*  guys would prep forever for that spot. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2048.1s)]
*  They just wanted that one, they wanted, there was some guys that only had like one kill [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2051.1s)]
*  or 7 minutes because their whole idea was just get on Letterman. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2055.42s)]
*  Get on the Tonight Show. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2060.7s)]
*  Get on something. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2062.22s)]
*  And that was like your career move back then. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2063.5s)]
*  This is pre-HBO comedy hours. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2066.18s)]
*  This is pre-everything. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2069.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2070.7s)]
*  I remember reading stories about like, oh Freddie Prinze got called over to the couch [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2071.7s)]
*  on his first time. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2074.58s)]
*  That never happens to anybody. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2076.02s)]
*  Well also you gotta remember, what were the numbers back then for the Tonight Show? [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2077.2999999999997s)]
*  Oh that must have been massive. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2081.14s)]
*  Right? [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2082.46s)]
*  There's only one of four shows you can watch at the time. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2083.46s)]
*  Right. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2084.8599999999997s)]
*  What was the average Tonight Show ratings in 1978? [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2085.8599999999997s)]
*  See if you can find that. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2091.1s)]
*  I bet it's nuts. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2092.1s)]
*  It's gotta be in the tens of millions. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2093.66s)]
*  It has to be. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2094.66s)]
*  I wanna think like 25 million. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2095.66s)]
*  And again this is at 11pm at night too. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2098.46s)]
*  Some people are kinda tired and they're laying in bed. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2101.58s)]
*  Johnny Carson. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2103.78s)]
*  He was the king. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2104.78s)]
*  With his desk. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2105.78s)]
*  They all did the same thing. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2106.78s)]
*  The desk and the chair. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2108.06s)]
*  Doesn't make any sense. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2109.06s)]
*  Why do you have a desk? [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2110.06s)]
*  Are you doing work? [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2111.62s)]
*  It's so weird you have a desk. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2112.62s)]
*  But everybody had a desk. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2115.78s)]
*  I guess it was like Jack Parr who started it out. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2116.78s)]
*  It was Steve Allen or Jack Parr. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2120.62s)]
*  Whoever was the first one. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2123.1s)]
*  Because there was Tonight Show guys before Johnny Carson. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2125.18s)]
*  And whoever it was they had a desk. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2128.58s)]
*  Because back then if you were the boss you sat behind the desk. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2130.94s)]
*  Would the Ed Sullivan show fall in this sort of world? [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2134.98s)]
*  What was that? [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2137.9s)]
*  Ed Sullivan. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2138.9s)]
*  Because in my mind that seems to be the precursor of all this and sort of what set this up. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2139.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2145.34s)]
*  Lenny Bruce did the Ed Sullivan show. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2146.34s)]
*  The Beatles famously. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2147.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2148.82s)]
*  Who else? [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2149.82s)]
*  A lot of people did it. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2150.82s)]
*  Was he the first? [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2153.14s)]
*  Was Ed Sullivan the first? [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2154.14s)]
*  It feels like from my understanding of it, it feels like he was the first mega star. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2155.98s)]
*  Jackie Mason got banned from the Ed Sullivan show because Ed Sullivan said that Jackie [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2160.94s)]
*  gave him the finger. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2166.78s)]
*  Really? [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2168.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2169.34s)]
*  But Jackie swears he didn't give him the finger. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2170.34s)]
*  He's just doing his hands. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2172.58s)]
*  Doing my hand gestures. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2173.58s)]
*  And he did something and Ed Sullivan said that fucking guy gave me the finger. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2174.58s)]
*  He's never coming back. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2180.18s)]
*  Damn. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2181.18s)]
*  See if you find what that is. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2182.2599999999998s)]
*  What happened with Jackie Mason on the Ed Sullivan show. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2183.7s)]
*  What year was that? [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2188.14s)]
*  It's got to be what? [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2190.06s)]
*  Like the 50s? [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2191.06s)]
*  60s? [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2192.06s)]
*  Early 60s? [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2193.06s)]
*  We're talking about Mason. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2194.06s)]
*  Do we find out what the ratings were for 1978? [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2195.06s)]
*  I was digging to 78. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2196.3799999999997s)]
*  There was just most of the stuff talking about the ratings is about its last week and last [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2197.8599999999997s)]
*  show. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2202.14s)]
*  What is that? [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2203.14s)]
*  Well, 50 million for the final show. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2204.14s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2206.94s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2207.94s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2208.94s)]
*  Oh my. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2210.7000000000003s)]
*  So you averaged 19 million a week. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2211.7000000000003s)]
*  That's wild. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2213.14s)]
*  No, no. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2214.14s)]
*  Just for that week. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2215.14s)]
*  Oh for that week. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2216.14s)]
*  I wasn't saying it was for the whole time. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2217.14s)]
*  Can you find out what the ratings were? [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2218.7400000000002s)]
*  Just let's say September 1978 to night show ratings. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2220.26s)]
*  I wonder if they even have those numbers. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2224.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2227.98s)]
*  What's really wild is like there's people that get away with not telling you the numbers. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2228.98s)]
*  Oh Netflix? [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2233.98s)]
*  Netflix gets away with it. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2234.98s)]
*  We were just discussing this last night because a friend of mine was saying like what are [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2236.02s)]
*  you thinking about this actor strike? [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2239.9s)]
*  And I said I really don't know enough about it to comment other than look if you're a [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2241.38s)]
*  person and you do something like even if you're a comic and you do something on Netflix like [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2247.62s)]
*  when I've done Netflix specials they just say it's doing really well and you go like [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2252.22s)]
*  what does that mean? [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2256.66s)]
*  Like how many people are watching it? [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2257.66s)]
*  We're really happy. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2259.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2260.1s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2261.1s)]
*  We're really happy. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2262.1s)]
*  It's doing great. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2263.1s)]
*  What are the numbers? [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2264.1s)]
*  What's the secret of keeping it secret? [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2265.22s)]
*  Well, it's a genius move because they don't have to tell you so you can't really negotiate. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2266.22s)]
*  Like if you do a special that special is 10 million people watch it. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2272.38s)]
*  Oh shit. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2276.14s)]
*  We're going to pay a son more money next time because if he finds out that this many people [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2277.14s)]
*  are watching you don't know until you go out in the road and then you sell more tickets [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2281.38s)]
*  and you're like oh people enjoyed it. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2284.18s)]
*  I guess it worked. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2285.74s)]
*  But when you don't have any data from the company they could just not give you the data. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2287.62s)]
*  Like on their side it's great for negotiation. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2292.82s)]
*  They don't have to tell you shit. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2294.42s)]
*  It's just they have all the leverage. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2296.3s)]
*  There was an article about this yesterday. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2297.3s)]
*  Okay. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2299.42s)]
*  Serendos defends not disclosing streaming numbers. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2300.42s)]
*  Creators feel felt trapped by ratings box office. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2304.02s)]
*  So how does he defend it? [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2307.3s)]
*  I like Ted Serendos by the way. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2308.7000000000003s)]
*  He's a very nice guy. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2310.6200000000003s)]
*  The longer paragraph is here but it's... [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2312.02s)]
*  Part of our promise with creators at the time we started creating original programming our [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2315.2000000000003s)]
*  creators felt like they were pretty trapped in this kind of overnight ratings world. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2318.6600000000003s)]
*  Oh they're trapped by ratings. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2322.46s)]
*  We're doing this for them. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2325.06s)]
*  Yeah we're doing it for them. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2326.06s)]
*  We're doing it for them. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2327.06s)]
*  They don't know. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2328.06s)]
*  Overnight Reigns an analyst interview that went live. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2329.06s)]
*  Oh a weekend box office world defining their success and failures. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2332.54s)]
*  Serendos said during a pre-recorded analyst interview. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2337.1400000000003s)]
*  That's a little gaslighty. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2340.1400000000003s)]
*  And as we know a show might have enormous success down the road and it wasn't captured in that [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2342.3s)]
*  opening box office. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2347.5s)]
*  So part of this was the relationship with the talent not just the business aspect of [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2348.54s)]
*  it. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2352.42s)]
*  And I do think that over time people are much more interested in this. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2353.42s)]
*  We're on a continuum today of how much data do we publish. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2357.02s)]
*  I think we've been leading the charge starting everyone down the path of a top 10 publishing [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2360.9s)]
*  our top 10 lists and our annual wrap up list and everything to give a lot of transparency [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2366.3s)]
*  to the viewing. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2371.3s)]
*  And I just expect we'll be more and more transparent. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2372.38s)]
*  Just say the numbers. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2375.54s)]
*  This is a weird little dance you're doing to avoid. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2376.7s)]
*  Just tell people what the numbers are. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2380.46s)]
*  YouTube was saying yesterday too that on top of this that they might be changing the way [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2382.8999999999996s)]
*  videos work. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2387.62s)]
*  I think they said for the first 24 hours that all stats will be live. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2388.62s)]
*  Like live view account live thumbs up. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2392.54s)]
*  I guess people really want to know that. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2394.8999999999996s)]
*  Sounds opposite of what he was just saying. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2396.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah that's what people want. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2398.3399999999997s)]
*  They want to know what's successful and what's not. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2399.62s)]
*  It does seem interesting that he says that like oh we have a show might do better as [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2402.7799999999997s)]
*  time goes on and the initial box office numbers might not reflect that. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2408.14s)]
*  But then you're also canceling all these shows the time they get to second and third season. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2411.9799999999996s)]
*  Yeah shut up. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2415.8999999999996s)]
*  Right? [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2416.8999999999996s)]
*  It's like it just doesn't lend that credibility. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2417.8999999999996s)]
*  No we're doing it for the creators. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2420.8999999999996s)]
*  Guys we love you. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2422.9399999999996s)]
*  We love you. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2425.54s)]
*  We're doing it for you. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2427.54s)]
*  Yeah this seems like a very abusive relationship. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2429.4599999999996s)]
*  So I would imagine that has something to do with I think if you were an actor and you [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2432.82s)]
*  were a star of a Netflix movie and it was fucking huge you would want to know what the [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2437.94s)]
*  numbers are. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2441.58s)]
*  Right. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2442.58s)]
*  It's got to be part of their I don't know is that part of what they're asking for? [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2443.58s)]
*  I know it's streaming revenue. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2446.86s)]
*  I think that was one of the things I asked you. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2448.3s)]
*  This is one of the things there's like the AI characters too that's a big part of this [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2449.78s)]
*  because SAG's still in strike right? [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2456.34s)]
*  I believe so yes. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2458.18s)]
*  So I think the AI thing was there was one contract that I don't know if it was actually [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2459.86s)]
*  being someone actually trying to get people to sign it or if it was just being discussed [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2466.06s)]
*  where they would pay the extra like an extra would be on the set and then they own their [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2470.94s)]
*  digital image. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2476.86s)]
*  They could use it forever. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2479.06s)]
*  So they could put you in the background of the fucking Hulk movie. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2480.06s)]
*  They could put you in the background of it. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2482.9s)]
*  You know like conspiracy theorists believe they're crisis actors who show up at every [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2485.5s)]
*  mass shooting and start talking about something and it's bullshit like this is the most evil [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2489.9s)]
*  of conspiracy theories right? [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2494.98s)]
*  But this crisis actor thing imagine if you just start seeing like AI people in every [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2497.14s)]
*  fucking movie every disaster movie you see that same guy like that's that dude and that [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2502.66s)]
*  dude probably got paid 200 bucks. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2507.94s)]
*  It's like the Wilhelm scream but with like people's faces. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2510.06s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2512.74s)]
*  So it would be like oh if it's a disaster scene you know this guy's in it. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2513.9799999999996s)]
*  Well maybe they'll be able to morph your image give you a mustache, fake nose. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2517.1s)]
*  I'm sure they can. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2521.18s)]
*  They can tweak your face. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2522.4599999999996s)]
*  I mean they can face swap you with different extras. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2523.4599999999996s)]
*  They can do all kinds of stuff. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2526.4599999999996s)]
*  Oh yeah yeah for sure. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2527.7s)]
*  What they can do. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2528.7s)]
*  Did you see the Unreal 5 video game engine? [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2529.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2532.8999999999996s)]
*  The car on fire? [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2533.8999999999996s)]
*  The car on fire? [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2534.8999999999996s)]
*  Jamie see if you could play that. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2535.8999999999996s)]
*  Someone said I forget the tweet but it was something along the lines of you're not going [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2537.06s)]
*  to be able to ever know what's real again. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2542.26s)]
*  No and it feels this way looking at the news with what's going on over you know over in [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2544.1000000000004s)]
*  Israel and Palestine it's like what am I seeing how much of this is real. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2548.34s)]
*  What's like the propaganda on top of that. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2552.2200000000003s)]
*  Shitty reporting. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2556.0200000000004s)]
*  Shitty reporting. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2557.0200000000004s)]
*  It's like it is like it's so interesting that we have phones and we have the access to information [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2558.0200000000004s)]
*  constantly and now we just know if none of that information is true. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2561.5s)]
*  Well we just know quickly what actually happened if you're online and paying attention and [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2565.0600000000004s)]
*  The mainstream news is so far behind that. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2570.62s)]
*  Coleman Hughes was on yesterday saying that you know the original narrative was that Israel [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2573.4599999999996s)]
*  bombed a hospital in Gaza. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2577.3399999999997s)]
*  What actually happened was another Islamic terrorist group launched a missile it failed [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2580.4199999999996s)]
*  and it landed in the parking lot of the hospital. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2585.2599999999998s)]
*  So this is fake. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2587.7s)]
*  This is the Unreal 5 engine. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2589.22s)]
*  You see a car on fire and then they have a little video thing pop through it. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2591.7s)]
*  Just the car is fake. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2595.74s)]
*  The rest of the video should be real. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2596.98s)]
*  So they inserted a car into a real scene. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2598.86s)]
*  Is that what they did. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2601.9s)]
*  Yes. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2602.9s)]
*  No one really knows though honestly because Unreal Engine looks so fucking good. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2603.9s)]
*  There's been a new video of the 5.3 and it looks. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2606.58s)]
*  But I could. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2609.54s)]
*  Jamie I could imagine that's all the video engine. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2610.54s)]
*  Why would you think. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2612.38s)]
*  It could be but like right there that person walking in the background. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2613.38s)]
*  Yeah but you could do that. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2615.38s)]
*  You could. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2617.06s)]
*  Well that would be easy because they're not even in focus. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2618.06s)]
*  That would be so easy in comparison to this car that's in focus. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2621.6200000000003s)]
*  It's just well I'm just with I've watched a lot of it. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2624.82s)]
*  I think all I did was add that. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2627.82s)]
*  OK. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2629.42s)]
*  Well you might be right. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2630.42s)]
*  But either way look how good that car on fire looks. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2631.82s)]
*  Yeah I mean it looks. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2634.02s)]
*  It looks. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2635.02s)]
*  It's fucking incredible. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2636.02s)]
*  Very real. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2637.02s)]
*  And look how the flames vary. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2638.02s)]
*  Like the flames vary like an actual flame would. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2639.46s)]
*  It's not like sometimes you watch like digital flames. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2642.2200000000003s)]
*  They do the same pattern over and over and over again. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2644.7000000000003s)]
*  But this just looks like real fucking fire. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2647.26s)]
*  There's a level of randomness. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2649.6200000000003s)]
*  It's reacting to the thing in it. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2650.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2652.7000000000003s)]
*  It's nuts man. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2653.7000000000003s)]
*  The thing is making the smoke move. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2654.74s)]
*  Motherfucker dude. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2658.02s)]
*  They're so good now. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2659.62s)]
*  You're not going to have any idea. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2661.66s)]
*  No you can't tell. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2662.8199999999997s)]
*  You can't tell what's real at all anymore. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2663.8199999999997s)]
*  And I think it was in 2015 they passed a law that allowed the CIA to use propaganda on [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2665.7799999999997s)]
*  citizens for the greater good of the nation. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2673.14s)]
*  No there's something like that. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2675.98s)]
*  I mean that's always been a thing though. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2677.2999999999997s)]
*  It's funny that they need to pass a law. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2678.54s)]
*  Well now they can't get arrested for it or no one can get in trouble for it. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2680.1s)]
*  Yeah I guess. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2683.7799999999997s)]
*  But no one was really getting in trouble for it. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2684.7799999999997s)]
*  No one was really getting in trouble. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2686.4199999999996s)]
*  Yeah it's like. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2687.4199999999996s)]
*  When you kill the president allegedly. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2688.4199999999996s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2690.5s)]
*  It's more like them dotting their eyes and crossing their teeth. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2691.5s)]
*  Like let's just make sure that no one. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2693.4199999999996s)]
*  What is that law Jamie? [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2694.8599999999997s)]
*  I was just looking it up. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2696.54s)]
*  I just stumbled across an article from the New York Times 1977. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2697.54s)]
*  Worldwide propaganda network built by the CIA. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2701.8199999999997s)]
*  Wow. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2704.3799999999997s)]
*  I can't even imagine. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2705.3799999999997s)]
*  1977. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2706.3799999999997s)]
*  I mean I can't find the article really but it's just going on. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2707.3799999999997s)]
*  It's so hard to know what's real and what's not real. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2710.7s)]
*  I think that's like we talked about the shift in COVID. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2714.66s)]
*  What it really caused. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2717.02s)]
*  It's like now I'm just suspicious of everything. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2718.02s)]
*  Everything. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2720.02s)]
*  Of everything. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2721.02s)]
*  Everything I read I'm like what's that? [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2722.02s)]
*  What angle is it coming from? [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2723.9399999999996s)]
*  Who's funding this? [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2725.2599999999998s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2726.58s)]
*  And it didn't used to be that way. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2727.58s)]
*  So this is what comes up about what we were just talking about though. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2728.8599999999997s)]

*  Former President Barack Obama signed a law in 2012 allowing the government to propaganda [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2737.62s)]
*  allowing government propaganda in the U.S. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2742.18s)]

*  the domestic dissemination of government funded media. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2786.02s)]

*  But I thought there was something else. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2912.6600000000003s)]
*  Where it was proposing that they were allowed to use propaganda if it was for the greater [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=2915.3s)]

*  Oh my god the earth is flat. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3147.14s)]
*  That would be Fast and Furious's greatest movie ever. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3152.14s)]
*  That would be unreal. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3155.02s)]
*  I don't think they had the balls to do that. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3156.02s)]
*  If they did it and said the world was flat, do you know how many people would fucking [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3157.7s)]
*  cheer? [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3161.78s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3162.78s)]
*  There are. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3163.78s)]
*  I would cheer. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3164.78s)]
*  The flat earth movement. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3165.78s)]
*  This is what happened with the flat earth movement. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3166.78s)]
*  It took off and then everybody went, oh get the fuck out of here. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3167.78s)]
*  What was I thinking? [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3169.94s)]
*  And now it seems to be back. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3170.94s)]
*  It seems to be back and bigger than ever. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3171.94s)]
*  There's more flat earth propaganda. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3174.5s)]
*  I don't understand what the point is. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3178.18s)]
*  Well the point is, here's the point. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3180.74s)]
*  The point is the government lies about everything including space. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3183.82s)]
*  We are really God's creation. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3187.06s)]
*  There's an ice wall around the outside of the world. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3189.46s)]
*  You're not allowed to pass it. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3192.1800000000003s)]
*  If you try to go there the military will stop you. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3193.1800000000003s)]
*  The military, even though there's fucking thousands and thousands of members that have [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3195.26s)]
*  probably seen this, they've hidden this information from the general public for the greater good [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3199.1s)]
*  of mankind or for evil reasons. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3202.94s)]
*  Because they don't want you to know about God. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3205.58s)]
*  And then the stars are just bullshit. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3208.46s)]
*  There's a firmament, there's a cover over the earth and that's why we can't go into space. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3211.18s)]
*  That's wild. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3215.06s)]
*  It's wild. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3216.54s)]
*  Because I always just thought, even if the earth was flat, what am I going to do? [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3217.54s)]
*  I'm just going to still go to Chipotle and live my life. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3223.14s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3226.9s)]
*  I never understood the point of getting that hyped into it. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3227.9s)]
*  To me it feels like sometimes a lot of conspiracy theories is adults who realize too late that [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3231.42s)]
*  the government's always lying to them. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3236.18s)]
*  That's what it sometimes feels like. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3238.78s)]
*  Where it's like, oh you just kind of found out too late. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3240.1000000000004s)]
*  So you're like, oh they must go on the extreme of everything. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3241.82s)]
*  Well people love conspiracy theories because some of them are real. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3244.3s)]
*  When you find out one's real you're like, holy shit they really did that? [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3249.0600000000004s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3253.5s)]
*  And then you start getting suspicious about everything. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3255.5s)]
*  You can go down rabbit holes. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3258.6200000000003s)]
*  The thing about a video on YouTube for instance, is you can find someone who's a really good [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3261.1800000000003s)]
*  narrator who's using good words and good sentences and they're speaking well and they [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3266.5s)]
*  sound intelligent and they're saying things that are just absolutely not true. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3272.06s)]
*  And no one's stepping in to prove it that it's not true. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3276.06s)]
*  But if they were having that same conversation and they were talking to like Brian Keating [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3280.86s)]
*  and he starts explaining to them how we know the earth is round. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3285.02s)]
*  How every planet we've ever observed is round. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3289.74s)]
*  Why they are round. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3292.82s)]
*  There's a thing called Bode's law where you could accurately predict based on the mass [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3294.98s)]
*  and the size of a planet where the next planet's going to be. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3303.02s)]
*  They're all round. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3306.58s)]
*  The idea that we're not. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3307.58s)]
*  How many planets have they found now? [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3310.58s)]
*  They started finding them as the equipment got better. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3313.14s)]
*  But I think it was a long time before they found the first exoplanet. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3316.34s)]
*  The first planet that was circling around a distant star. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3319.8s)]
*  Now I think they've detected hundreds and hundreds of them. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3322.94s)]
*  I don't even know how many they've detected. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3325.94s)]
*  But like they're all round. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3328.14s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3329.14s)]
*  All of them are round. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3330.14s)]
*  The idea that we're the only ones that isn't round. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3331.14s)]
*  We're special. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3333.26s)]
*  It's not a perfect sphere. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3334.26s)]
*  They'll tell you that. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3335.26s)]
*  It's not a perfect sphere. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3336.26s)]
*  Okay, get at it. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3337.26s)]
*  Go around it with a ruler. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3338.86s)]
*  Do whatever the fuck you gotta do. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3339.86s)]
*  Yeah, it's not perfect. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3341.86s)]
*  It's like it bulges out at the sides slightly but you can't tell by looking at it, stupid. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3342.86s)]
*  Right, it's still pretty much a circle. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3348.6600000000003s)]
*  It's a fucking globe. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3350.46s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3352.22s)]
*  But why would you want to think it's flat? [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3353.22s)]
*  I don't understand why that helps you to think it's flat. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3354.5s)]
*  It's a waste of time. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3357.7s)]
*  The mystery is in the entire thing itself. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3359.74s)]
*  The mystery is that we are literally on an organic spaceship floating in what might be [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3363.38s)]
*  God. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3370.5s)]
*  The universe might be God. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3371.7s)]

*  Above us is just immense energy. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3377.22s)]
*  Bigger explosions, many times bigger than our sun, surrounded by planets and fucking [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3381.34s)]
*  black holes and dark matter. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3387.54s)]
*  It is wild up there. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3390.58s)]
*  And you're concentrating on the shape of Earth. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3393.6200000000003s)]
*  It's such a waste of time. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3395.82s)]
*  And this idea that there's some great conspiracy to protect people from it or to keep that [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3397.94s)]
*  information because if we knew that God was real, we would... [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3403.7400000000002s)]
*  No, no. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3407.54s)]
*  I know it's fun. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3408.9s)]
*  I know it's fun to believe that. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3410.66s)]
*  But this motherfucker is round. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3412.14s)]
*  It doesn't mean there's no God. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3413.86s)]
*  It doesn't mean God didn't create it. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3415.42s)]
*  Because really no one knows. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3417.54s)]

*  Yeah, we're all just doing our best guess. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3422.02s)]
*  Well, it definitely feels like there's something more. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3424.06s)]
*  Whatever this is, whatever the energy that we share with each other, there's definitely [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3427.54s)]
*  some sort of spirituality in this world that you have to sort of let in. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3431.9s)]
*  I think there's something to that the energy that you... [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3435.82s)]
*  And I've had this in the isolation tank. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3439.82s)]
*  I've had it in psychedelic experiences. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3442.5s)]
*  There's moments where you reach a state where you understand that your experiences with [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3445.0600000000004s)]
*  people and all the things you do in life is energy. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3452.6200000000003s)]

*  it creates more problems. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3464.9s)]

*  I know you're probably frustrated in your life and you think that's part of your personality [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3473.7000000000003s)]
*  to be blunt. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3477.58s)]
*  But every time someone does that, it ripples out. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3478.58s)]
*  That person feels negative about people and then they're always taking it in their mind, [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3481.5s)]
*  oh, sometimes people can be douchebags. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3485.62s)]
*  And then it's just going to create more issues in your life and the lives of the people that [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3487.54s)]
*  you run into. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3492.3s)]
*  But if you can find a way to recognize that and shift it, then you could do the opposite. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3493.46s)]
*  And the more positive you put out and the more positive conversations, the positive [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3500.7000000000003s)]

*  We have the energy you bring into the room. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3537.14s)]
*  You see it at a club all the time. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3538.62s)]
*  100%. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3540.38s)]
*  If the first point of contact they meet, whoever bags their phone is having a rough day and [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3541.38s)]
*  they let that rough day come out of them. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3546.7s)]
*  The shows going forward will not be as good because their first point of contact is someone [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3549.5s)]
*  who is not in a good space. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3555.14s)]
*  And they take that space with them and bring it to their seat. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3558.2200000000003s)]
*  It's all those sort of things, like the small little things matter in a comedy show. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3561.3s)]
*  100%. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3565.7400000000002s)]
*  Where it's like, yeah, the way they seat the room sometimes fucks with the energy if they [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3566.7400000000002s)]
*  seat it poorly. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3570.52s)]
*  And it's like all that stuff matters. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3571.52s)]
*  You can't seat people. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3573.82s)]
*  You have to seat them close and next to each other all the way through. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3575.9s)]
*  That builds energy. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3579.98s)]
*  If you seat people randomly, then the show has no cohesive feel to it. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3580.98s)]
*  It's very interesting. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3585.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3586.46s)]
*  It's well, and also like the camaraderie at the club, that's all very contagious too. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3587.46s)]
*  The camaraderie and the friendship and the support and how everybody's very cool and [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3592.9s)]
*  very complimentary. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3597.2200000000003s)]
*  And there isn't that weird fucking competitive energy that used to get particularly in the [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3598.7400000000002s)]
*  90s, man. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3603.62s)]
*  When I first came to the store, it was, God, it was so dog eat dog. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3604.7799999999997s)]
*  Because everybody was trying to get on a sitcom. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3608.7s)]
*  And if you and I both went on an audition for a sitcom and you got it, I would be like, [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3610.66s)]
*  God damn it. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3615.42s)]
*  Now his life has changed. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3616.42s)]
*  I see you on TV Guide now. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3617.92s)]
*  This motherfucker. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3620.06s)]
*  Like, he's living the good life. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3621.06s)]
*  And I'm over here grinding at 1130 sets. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3623.5s)]
*  Yeah, trying to get them to look at me. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3626.7s)]
*  Yeah, in front of 50 people. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3628.42s)]
*  I can't get an agent. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3630.06s)]
*  Fuck! [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3631.62s)]
*  And so there was this hypercompetitiveness amongst comedians. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3632.74s)]
*  And it's all these bad mindsets. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3637.54s)]
*  They had this idea that somehow or another, if you got something and it was good for you, [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3639.7s)]
*  it was somehow or another taking away from my success. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3644.74s)]
*  It's really stupid. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3647.3399999999997s)]
*  But it was all because of the fact that everybody was clamoring for a tiny amount of jobs. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3649.06s)]
*  Well, yeah, it seemed like back then the industry held the keys. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3652.62s)]
*  They did. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3655.46s)]
*  Yeah, they really held the keys. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3656.46s)]
*  And now it doesn't feel like that at all. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3657.46s)]
*  At all. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3660.14s)]
*  You can just do what you want. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3661.54s)]
*  That's the best part. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3662.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3663.54s)]
*  Is that I'm not, you know, if you come here you don't have to worry about, like, oh, if [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3664.54s)]
*  I say this will I not get this job? [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3668.94s)]
*  Right. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3670.94s)]
*  I can just talk about what's on my mind. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3671.94s)]
*  Yeah, you can do whatever you want. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3673.74s)]
*  Right, that's a level of freedom that, you know. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3675.74s)]
*  And I do wonder if, because eventually industry and stuff are going to start coming here. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3679.1s)]
*  What does that mean anymore, though? [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3683.42s)]
*  You know, eventually, but they already have people in LA. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3686.06s)]
*  Stick with those people that are stuck in LA. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3689.82s)]
*  Right. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3691.94s)]
*  Because it's just, what the industry out here is podcasting. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3692.94s)]
*  That's true. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3695.6600000000003s)]
*  That's the major entertainment industry now. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3696.6600000000003s)]
*  That's true. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3698.26s)]
*  But I will say this, a great stand-up comic can do a lot of, like, you know, Robin Williams. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3699.26s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3704.02s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3705.02s)]
*  Like, the reality is that if the great stand-up, if all the great young stand-up comics start [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3706.02s)]
*  moving here, well then your next great actor might be there. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3710.02s)]
*  I'll never forget walking in the comic store and you see Michael Keaton's name lit up. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3713.46s)]
*  It's like, oh, you could be a comedian and then be Batman. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3718.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3721.02s)]
*  Like, that's a possibility that's open for you. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3722.02s)]
*  So you know, a lot of these great actors were stand-ups. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3725.42s)]
*  And so a lot of great writers were stand-ups. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3730.06s)]
*  So eventually they'll be like, well, if that's where the talent is, that's where we have to go. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3732.42s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3735.54s)]
*  I think they're going to stay put. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3736.54s)]
*  You think so? [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3737.94s)]
*  Yeah, I think they're going to ride it out until that fucking ship goes right into the rocks. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3738.94s)]
*  Boom. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3742.74s)]
*  I think that's almost a vested interest for people in LA to not want this to work. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3743.74s)]
*  Us? [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3748.2999999999997s)]
*  This place? [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3749.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3750.2999999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3751.2999999999997s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3752.2999999999997s)]
*  Well, good luck. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3753.2999999999997s)]
*  It's such a stupid thing to think like that. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3754.2999999999997s)]
*  Any comic should be happy that there's more comedy. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3755.58s)]
*  Any comic should be happy. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3758.1s)]
*  And also, by the way, if we're here, you get more stage time in LA. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3759.18s)]
*  So take advantage of that. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3763.02s)]
*  Because there's a lot of people getting stage time at the store that probably wouldn't get [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3764.5s)]
*  it if Tom Segura was still in town, if Christina Byszycki was still in town. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3767.2999999999997s)]
*  So many people moved here. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3772.62s)]
*  Duncan, everyone moved here. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3774.1s)]
*  So it's like there's a lot of spots for you in LA. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3776.06s)]
*  That's true. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3779.18s)]
*  Just try to do what we're doing. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3780.18s)]
*  Try to do it the right way. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3782.14s)]
*  Just try to be supportive and fun and don't push a fucking certain ideology on each other. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3783.46s)]
*  Well, you can't push ideologies. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3788.62s)]
*  Not in stand up. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3791.14s)]
*  It's so stupid. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3792.14s)]
*  Trying to do woke stand up or trying to turn a club woke is like... [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3793.14s)]
*  Well, yeah, just trying to be any sort of like you have to think along this line. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3796.02s)]
*  It's like, no, that's not what... [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3799.98s)]
*  Right, imagine if there was only a right wing comedy club. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3802.5400000000004s)]
*  Right, it would be awful. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3805.26s)]
*  You know, no Trump jokes, bro. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3806.26s)]
*  Nobody wants to hear them. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3808.5400000000004s)]
*  What? [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3809.5400000000004s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3810.5400000000004s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3811.5400000000004s)]
*  You can't walk an ideological line. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3812.5400000000004s)]
*  What I find so funny is that there's so many of these, you'll hear like, oh, we need to [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3815.6200000000003s)]
*  be more diversity in the club or whatever. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3820.38s)]
*  A lot of times when Hollywood does diversity, I think it's something that Brian Simpson [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3825.34s)]
*  and I have talked about. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3828.94s)]
*  They'll just take, oh, we need a brown guy. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3829.94s)]
*  We'll just take the first brown guy. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3831.9s)]
*  That's like kind of whatever. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3834.02s)]
*  That's kind of do it. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3835.78s)]
*  But like when you focus on like, hey, let's just bring the funniest people here. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3837.5s)]
*  The diversity naturally comes. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3841.82s)]
*  Right. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3843.9s)]
*  Funny doesn't fall along the lines of like race, gender, sexuality. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3845.5s)]
*  It's just, are you funny or are you not funny? [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3850.14s)]
*  And I would say the mothership lineups without really trying to be diverse are actually diverse. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3854.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3861.5s)]
*  Because just talented people all walks of life. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3862.5s)]
*  All that matters. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3864.5s)]
*  Yes. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3865.5s)]
*  Can you make people laugh? [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3866.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3867.5s)]
*  That's the only thing that should matter. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3868.5s)]
*  And that's, you know, it doesn't matter how you do it. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3869.5s)]
*  If you can do it, you can do it. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3871.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3873.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3874.5s)]
*  It's a meritocracy. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3875.5s)]
*  It really is. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3876.5s)]
*  And it should be. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3877.5s)]
*  But it's also, there's a system at that place. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3878.5s)]
*  Like you're going to get a chance to do professional work eventually. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3882.2599999999998s)]
*  Someone's going to bring you on the road with them. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3886.18s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3887.8999999999996s)]
*  And then when that happens, like, you know, Tony brings people on the road with him, like [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3888.8999999999996s)]
*  brings Cam. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3892.14s)]
*  Cam started on Kill Tony. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3893.14s)]
*  Right. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3894.14s)]
*  All these guys are real new. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3895.14s)]
*  When he takes these guys on the road with them and they start getting professional careers, [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3897.14s)]
*  like other comics will now do the same thing. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3900.94s)]
*  And it's just, you have a path. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3903.22s)]
*  Whereas I think when we all started out, it was a lot more random. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3905.8999999999996s)]
*  There was no clear place where you could go and you could learn from watching all these [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3910.34s)]
*  other comics and then you get spots and then you could eventually be a pro. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3914.62s)]
*  Right. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3917.9s)]
*  Right. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3918.9s)]
*  And then the stuff on that path is open for you. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3919.9s)]
*  Like I look at Cam and Cam is, he's pretty famous off one clip of being in Austin. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3921.42s)]
*  That's a famous guy. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3928.06s)]
*  You know? [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3929.06s)]
*  And it's like, that's fucking dope. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3930.06s)]
*  That's awesome. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3931.94s)]
*  It's like, you can't tell me that I'm not famous. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3932.94s)]
*  Look at my friend. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3935.94s)]
*  He's famous. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3936.94s)]
*  Derek right now is on a European tour with Schultz. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3937.98s)]
*  Just did the Royal Albert Hall. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3941.02s)]
*  You can't tell me I didn't just do the Royal Albert Hall. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3942.7400000000002s)]
*  Because that's what it feels like. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3944.7400000000002s)]
*  It's like, oh, we got that from here. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3945.7400000000002s)]
*  Look at, just go, go, go. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3947.86s)]
*  Everybody up. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3949.34s)]
*  Everybody up. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3950.34s)]
*  It's pretty amazing. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3951.34s)]
*  It's awesome. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3952.34s)]
*  It's like the energy here. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3953.34s)]
*  It's just, it's, oh man. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3954.34s)]
*  It's crazy that it all just lined up perfectly. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3955.82s)]
*  You know, I moved here. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3958.66s)]
*  I'm like, I gotta do something. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3959.66s)]
*  And then when Tom moved here, like I, he was sick of it too. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3961.5s)]
*  And he moved here not long after me. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3965.7400000000002s)]
*  He goes, you gonna open up a club? [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3967.38s)]
*  I go, 100%. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3968.38s)]
*  He goes, okay, I'm moving to Austin. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3969.38s)]
*  Damn. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3971.02s)]
*  I was like, oh shit. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3972.02s)]
*  Damn. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3973.02s)]
*  That's when it felt real. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3974.02s)]
*  Because they picked up their family, all their employees, everybody. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3975.02s)]
*  We're moving to Texas. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3978.42s)]
*  Started their studio here. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3980.1400000000003s)]
*  I was like, whoa. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3981.1400000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3982.1400000000003s)]
*  And so, you know, there was enough stand up in town that we always could work at the Vulcan. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3983.2200000000003s)]
*  But this dream of putting together this like perfect comedy community. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3988.78s)]
*  Boy, when it happened, it's almost like, dude, it felt like that building wanted us to be [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3994.02s)]
*  there. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3998.94s)]
*  You know, like this weird energy, like the building was like, thank you. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=3999.94s)]
*  Well, the building is alive. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4003.38s)]
*  That's what I like about the building. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4005.94s)]
*  It's alive. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4006.94s)]
*  It's alive. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4007.94s)]
*  There's a history before us. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4008.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4010.38s)]
*  Massive. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4011.38s)]
*  And that matters. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4012.38s)]
*  It adds flavor to the, it's like the story. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4013.38s)]
*  Was that mob hangout that Searose? [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4014.54s)]
*  There was a swastika on the wall. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4016.02s)]
*  When you came in? [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4018.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4020.06s)]
*  Oh yeah, you told me. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4021.06s)]
*  So we tore the walls down. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4022.2999999999997s)]
*  So we tore the outside of the wall and you see the exposed brick and one of the exposed [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4023.2999999999997s)]
*  brick was a fucking swastika. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4026.66s)]
*  And I was like, we should probably get rid of that. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4028.94s)]
*  And it was there for months. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4031.66s)]
*  Nobody got rid of it. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4032.66s)]
*  And one day I got there and I go, hey guys, we're going to open in like two months. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4034.22s)]
*  Get rid of the fucking swastika. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4038.94s)]
*  And so you know what they did? [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4041.14s)]
*  They cleaned up, it was black spray paint. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4042.14s)]
*  They cleaned off the swastika. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4044.66s)]
*  So now it was even clearer. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4047.42s)]
*  Because now it was in white. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4050.1800000000003s)]
*  I was like, hey, get the fucking design off the wall. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4051.1800000000003s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4056.6200000000003s)]
*  You could take that as the Hindu symbol for good fortune. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4059.02s)]
*  Is it the opposite way though? [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4061.1800000000003s)]
*  Isn't the swastika going the wrong way? [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4063.46s)]
*  The swastika is on its edge and I think the Hindu one is flat. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4065.06s)]
*  Okay. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4067.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4068.7000000000003s)]
*  Because is it going in the same direction? [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4069.7000000000003s)]
*  Because there's different ones. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4070.7000000000003s)]
*  I don't, I think they might be going separate directions. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4071.7000000000003s)]
*  It's just very funny because my girlfriend's Hindu and just walking around her house and [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4075.06s)]
*  there's just swastikas everywhere. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4077.58s)]
*  That guy ruined that design. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4079.58s)]
*  That design had been around forever. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4081.98s)]
*  It's like a blessing thing. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4084.2599999999998s)]
*  There's a lot of like, you'll see a lot of, this happened in Derek's apartment complex. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4085.2599999999998s)]
*  He was like, yo, this is crazy. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4090.7s)]
*  And it was a giant swastika on the hood of the car, but it was a Hindu swastika. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4092.08s)]
*  And that's like one of the things they do to bless their automobile. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4097.62s)]
*  Like something new. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4102.26s)]
*  Maybe ghost stripes. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4103.820000000001s)]
*  Don't have it too fucking obvious. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4104.820000000001s)]

*  All this sounds like at the time, that sounds absolutely horrifying. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4486.22s)]
*  Having to face that army sounds insane, but so far away, it's like, damn, that's pretty [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4491.18s)]
*  metal. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4494.54s)]
*  It's crazy that over time, atrocities like that become fascinating instead of what's [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4495.9s)]
*  going on right now in Israel and Palestine, which is too close to us. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4500.98s)]
*  Right. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4504.5s)]
*  It's what's happening now. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4505.5s)]
*  That was a normal Sunday for the Mongols. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4506.5s)]
*  Right. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4509.0199999999995s)]
*  You stormed a rave and killed 200 people? [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4510.0199999999995s)]
*  I was going to say, the benefit of having all these cameras and having all this information [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4512.46s)]
*  is that it is less brutal than that. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4518.4s)]
*  It is less brutal than that. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4521.2s)]
*  If you were to talk about the hospital bombing, well, maybe if it's just a war of information [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4522.86s)]
*  and it hit a parking lot, well, 500 people aren't dead. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4529.08s)]
*  It's just a hypothetical 500 people that are dead. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4533.04s)]
*  It's like a ... [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4535.0s)]
*  Well, Coleman Hughes said that it's actually probably somewhere between 50 and 100 people [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4536.0s)]
*  are dead. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4539.92s)]
*  They don't even know what number that is because the original claim was that it hit the hospital. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4540.92s)]
*  The New York Times used an image that was not of that hospital in their story about [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4547.2s)]
*  the bomb from Israel hitting the hospital. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4553.5199999999995s)]
*  They used this destroyed building. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4556.36s)]
*  They put out a fake picture with a fake story. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4559.639999999999s)]
*  I don't think anyone knows really what's what over there with the pictures they're getting. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4562.84s)]
*  You can't fucking print that if you're The New York Times. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4566.2s)]
*  We're already struggling to trust you. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4569.96s)]
*  You would think you couldn't print that if you're The New York Times. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4572.0s)]
*  At this point, it's more par for the course. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4573.92s)]
*  It's like, of course The New York Times would print that. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4575.44s)]
*  How? [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4577.04s)]
*  How are you doing that? [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4578.04s)]
*  Why are you doing that? [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4579.679999999999s)]
*  The need for news to get clicks and ratings is probably one of the worst. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4582.799999999999s)]
*  The amount of damage that the 24-hour news network simply by existing have caused on [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4590.08s)]
*  us is huge. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4594.92s)]
*  From the news being a thing to be like, this is how we get out information, to being like, [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4597.38s)]
*  we need to jack up and get ratings. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4602.799999999999s)]
*  We need to make sure we have clicks and eyeballs. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4605.639999999999s)]
*  That is damaging. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4608.88s)]
*  You definitely are like, if you're in The New York Times, if we just run with this now, [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4611.24s)]
*  the amount of attention that got, it was a whole day of everything on Twitter was about [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4617.719999999999s)]
*  what happened there. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4621.4s)]
*  Who shot the rockets? [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4622.78s)]
*  What did it actually hit? [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4623.78s)]
*  It was all that. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4625.28s)]
*  I'm on Twitter. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4627.04s)]
*  I'm checking these things too. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4628.04s)]
*  Apparently, the way they found out that it was not Israel, but there's proof of it, was [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4629.44s)]
*  a video that, was it CNN accident or Al Jazeera? [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4635.48s)]
*  Al Jazeera accidentally aired this video. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4640.16s)]
*  The video showed where the rocket came from. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4643.719999999999s)]
*  It showed it going down in the city. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4646.24s)]
*  It showed going down where the parking lot of the hotel was, allegedly. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4649.0s)]
*  Even then, when you see something like that, you're like, I don't know where this video's [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4654.28s)]
*  from. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4656.599999999999s)]

*  Right. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4659.0s)]
*  I don't ... I just assume that ... Yeah, absolutely. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4660.0s)]
*  I just assume that everything we're being fed about that isn't just a lie. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4662.84s)]
*  There was a bunch of videos that were being spread around at the beginning of the Ukraine [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4665.96s)]
*  War and then someone said, hey, this is literally from a video game. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4669.28s)]
*  This is a scene in a video. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4673.92s)]
*  Wasn't that the case, Jamie? [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4674.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4676.24s)]

*  Oh, yeah. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4682.24s)]
*  If the government is allowed to do that or does that if they're not allowed or whatever, [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4683.24s)]
*  they can do kind of whatever they want now and make it look real. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4688.26s)]

*  Oh, yeah. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4692.58s)]
*  I was thinking this the other day. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4693.58s)]
*  What this has shown me is the importance of if you're in a war of having a social media [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4694.58s)]
*  manager. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4698.62s)]

*  They're tagging Taylor Swift. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4713.7s)]
*  Why? [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4714.7s)]
*  They want her to retweet it? [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4715.7s)]
*  Because her bodyguard is part of the IDF, I think. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4716.94s)]
*  Oh, I see. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4719.74s)]
*  And he went to go back and ... You know what I mean? [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4720.74s)]

*  Right. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4730.26s)]
*  It's even that. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4731.26s)]
*  It's like, is that real? [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4732.26s)]
*  Is that fake? [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4733.26s)]
*  Because I can sort of see them doing that. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4734.26s)]
*  Right. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4735.26s)]
*  What is your thought on ... There's people that think that Twitter should be regulated [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4736.26s)]
*  more and that it should be moderated more because of the false information that comes [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4739.139999999999s)]
*  out. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4743.7s)]
*  The community notes is the best solution to that. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4744.86s)]
*  That's the best you can do, right? [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4748.26s)]
*  Because it's like, if you ... the road to hell is paved with good intentions. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4749.66s)]
*  If you're like, let's make sure that no fake things are posted on Twitter. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4754.46s)]

*  Right. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4761.22s)]

*  And one of the things we ran into with Alex Berenson getting removed from Twitter for [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4765.42s)]
*  printing actual studies and talking about real data about COVID and vaccines. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4768.9s)]
*  Right. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4774.58s)]
*  You can't do that. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4775.58s)]
*  They want to do that. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4776.58s)]
*  They want to be able to shut up anybody that's doing something that's going to fuck up that [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4777.58s)]
*  business. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4780.5s)]
*  Right. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4781.5s)]
*  And if you're doing that on Twitter, then when you found out that the FBI was contacting [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4782.5s)]
*  Twitter, getting them to take things down, that is wild. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4785.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4789.74s)]
*  And it's very short-sighted, too, for people to be like, well, you know ... So you would, [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4790.74s)]
*  let's say, with that specifically, you would be like, you know, one of the people who are [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4794.54s)]
*  pro-vaccines, like, oh, this is the science. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4798.34s)]
*  We're taking anti-science stuff out. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4800.46s)]
*  And let's say that's what's happening, right? [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4801.7s)]
*  And you're fine with that. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4803.06s)]
*  But you are not seeing the fact that, like, that, whatever is happening there can easily [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4804.3s)]
*  just turn on you. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4808.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4809.82s)]

*  You're like, no, no, no, but it's right. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4812.38s)]
*  Well, not only that, the problem was they were stifling debate from real scientists. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4813.38s)]
*  Right. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4819.02s)]
*  Right. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4820.02s)]
*  Like, Jay Bhattacharya, like, people from Stanford, real epidemiologists, real virologists, [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4821.02s)]
*  real people that were saying, hey, this approach is wrong. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4826.42s)]

*  This is not right. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4835.02s)]
*  This is not good science. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4836.02s)]
*  And they were getting silenced. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4837.18s)]
*  Right. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4838.18s)]
*  That's when it gets crazy, when actual experts in the field who really know what they're [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4839.18s)]
*  talking about are not allowed to give dissenting opinions. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4843.06s)]
*  That's the only way science gets settled. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4846.14s)]
*  You have to have other scientists put the data to the test, and they have to be able [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4848.1s)]
*  to openly debate it. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4853.660000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4854.660000000001s)]
*  You're not doing science anymore. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4856.0599999999995s)]
*  Now you're a mouthpiece for whatever, whether it's the pharmaceutical drug companies or [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4857.58s)]
*  it's the government or someone. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4862.0599999999995s)]
*  Right. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4863.54s)]
*  Well, they did. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4864.54s)]
*  And they also did a good job of getting, like, people. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4865.54s)]
*  So, you know, during the lockdown, I was doing this thing on TikTok where I would just grow [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4867.18s)]
*  my beard every day until the vaccine came out. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4876.8s)]
*  And then I would shave my beard when I took the vaccine. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4879.36s)]
*  So that's what I did. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4880.86s)]
*  I got the vaccine beard. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4881.86s)]
*  And then, yeah, it was a fun moment. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4883.9s)]
*  I had 40,000 people watch me shave my beard. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4885.7s)]
*  It was a good moment. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4889.98s)]
*  That's ridiculous. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4890.98s)]
*  But at the time, you couldn't have told me that, like, oh, OK, this is bad. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4891.98s)]
*  This is bad. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4895.3s)]
*  You know, because I was like, oh, right, of course they want us to get out of this. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4896.3s)]
*  Of course they want us to, like, you know. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4899.34s)]
*  And so they did a good job of keeping us pent up for so long that when the only option was [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4901.9s)]
*  And they told us that this was this vaccine. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4910.06s)]
*  Me and people like me would be like, well, all these anti-vax people are fucking idiots. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4912.9800000000005s)]
*  This is a way out. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4916.780000000001s)]
*  This is the way out. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4917.780000000001s)]
*  You don't want the way out? [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4918.780000000001s)]
*  And you couldn't have told me back then. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4920.780000000001s)]
*  It took me moving to Texas and then being here and being like, oh, they were just open [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4921.9800000000005s)]
*  the whole time and everyone's fine. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4926.08s)]
*  Everyone's fine. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4930.780000000001s)]
*  But a lot of people got vaccinated here, too. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4931.780000000001s)]
*  A lot of people had to for travel. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4932.780000000001s)]
*  And then this is where it became weird for me is when they started forcing people to [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4935.54s)]
*  do it. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4941.26s)]
*  And then at the same time, like, yeah, I know, it's just weird. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4944.7s)]
*  Like why you have to go inside? [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4949.5s)]
*  Well, it also wasn't scientific because they didn't account for people that had been infected [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4951.34s)]
*  and then recovered, which was far superior protection than the vaccine was imparting. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4956.46s)]
*  They didn't look at the data. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4961.64s)]
*  It was just there was a binary solution. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4962.78s)]
*  There was one thing. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4964.3s)]
*  If you didn't do that, you were part of the problem. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4966.06s)]
*  And they did a great job of keeping people pent up inside when they offered that solution. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4968.06s)]
*  They were like, this is the way out. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4975.5s)]
*  But I think they played that hand too poorly because I don't think people are ever going [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4977.28s)]
*  to go for that again. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4982.14s)]
*  No, even I was talking to my mom about this and she was, you know, she was very, everyone [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4983.14s)]
*  get vaccinated. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4990.74s)]
*  I was like, we're talking about the new booster and she's like, I don't think I'm going to [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4991.74s)]
*  take that. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4994.18s)]
*  They overplayed it. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4996.06s)]
*  They overplayed it. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4997.06s)]
*  But for a while they did a good job of making everyone forget that the pharmaceuticals were [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=4998.06s)]
*  just evil. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5000.740000000001s)]
*  Did you see that child? [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5001.740000000001s)]
*  He's a boy who's eight years old who was the face of the Israeli vaccine ad. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5002.740000000001s)]
*  It was like there's a propaganda ad that they put out. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5009.42s)]
*  He just died of a heart attack. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5012.26s)]
*  See, I saw that and my first thought was like, is that real though? [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5013.38s)]
*  Right. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5017.06s)]
*  Good question. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5018.06s)]
*  Like, is that actually real? [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5019.06s)]
*  Because I just saw it on some tweet. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5020.46s)]
*  Next year, only 17% of Americans got the fall COVID booster. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5022.98s)]
*  So far this year, it's under 3% per Bloomberg. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5026.459999999999s)]
*  Well, I guess if you're like an old person, you would be real tempted to get that and [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5029.219999999999s)]
*  maybe it would help you if you're really old and you have a weak immune system, it might [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5035.139999999999s)]
*  give you a boost. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5038.98s)]
*  But to give it to kids, like to give it to eight year olds, there's fucking no reason [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5039.98s)]
*  for that. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5043.78s)]
*  They know there's no reason for that. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5044.78s)]
*  There's no data that shows there's a good reason for that. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5045.78s)]
*  That was one of the first things we knew is that it didn't kill young people. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5047.54s)]
*  That's one of the scariest things. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5050.22s)]
*  They're willing to do it to kids. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5051.860000000001s)]
*  That's scary. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5054.14s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5055.14s)]
*  Because there's a massive amount of profit in it. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5056.14s)]
*  No one wants to think that they think like that, but they do. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5057.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5059.62s)]
*  It's like, what am I going to worry about some random kid? [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5060.62s)]
*  I can get money. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5062.3s)]
*  Money? [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5063.3s)]
*  So did you find out about the eight year old kid? [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5064.3s)]
*  Is that real? [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5067.5s)]
*  I've seen one link and it doesn't seem like the most reputable site, so I'm looking harder. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5069.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5074.780000000001s)]
*  Because that's the first thing I thought when I saw that. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5075.780000000001s)]
*  It could be fake. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5078.14s)]
*  Because I saw it was posted by DiedSuddenly. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5080.18s)]
*  That Twitter account. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5083.58s)]
*  I was like, I've got to see it coming from someone else who doesn't have skin in the [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5084.58s)]
*  game like that. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5086.86s)]
*  Right. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5087.86s)]
*  DiedSuddenly. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5088.86s)]
*  A lot of those DiedSuddenly's people that were suffering from leukemia for 10 years. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5089.86s)]
*  Or it'll be like ... Because sometimes there is that correlation with the athletes, right? [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5096.06s)]
*  Where more athletes are doing it now. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5101.02s)]
*  That's real. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5102.9s)]
*  The scariest one is the excess mortality data for young people. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5104.54s)]
*  Right. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5108.74s)]
*  Because the data for young people from I think its age, whatever it is, 12 to 49 is up way. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5109.74s)]
*  Very high. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5116.78s)]
*  Right. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5117.78s)]
*  I read something about it being around 40%, which is crazy. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5118.78s)]
*  Man. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5123.0599999999995s)]
*  Excess all cause mortality. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5124.0599999999995s)]
*  I can't think of someone who's been vindicated more than Aaron Rodgers in all of this. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5127.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5131.98s)]
*  I remember when he first went out, I was so mad because I was like, come on. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5133.179999999999s)]
*  You're supposed to be the face. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5137.54s)]
*  I'm still very vaccine. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5139.54s)]
*  At the time, I'm a big Niners fan. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5140.54s)]
*  The Packers were supposed to play Kansas City who had just beat the Niners in the Super [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5145.179999999999s)]
*  Bowl. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5149.299999999999s)]
*  Kansas City was shaky. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5150.299999999999s)]
*  I was like, oh, Aaron, if you fucking get them at the right time, you could cripple [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5151.299999999999s)]
*  their season. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5154.86s)]

*  Now I'm like, oh wow. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5159.259999999999s)]
*  I'm glad that someone was like, hey, I know what's right for my body. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5161.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5164.46s)]
*  Well, he's also allergic to one of the major ingredients of the vaccine. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5165.46s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5168.06s)]
*  No one wanted to take that into account. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5169.06s)]
*  Well, just the idea that this top athlete might be very aware of what he's putting into [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5170.06s)]
*  his body. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5177.34s)]
*  Right. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5178.34s)]
*  Of course. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5179.34s)]
*  And then that we all got sort of mad at that. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5180.34s)]
*  Also, top athletes aren't in danger. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5181.58s)]
*  This is not a disease that was killing top athletes. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5184.54s)]

*  I'll just leave it with that. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5357.820000000001s)]
*  OK. OK. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5359.0199999999995s)]

*  I was going to go with the family statement. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5361.86s)]

*  And that's where the statement came from. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5365.78s)]
*  And that's what they're saying. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5367.0599999999995s)]
*  So well, obviously, that's not normal. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5368.379999999999s)]
*  Right. Right. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5371.179999999999s)]

*  Now, it's like, man, if that's real, that's crazy. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5379.58s)]

*  I remember being in a hotel room. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5396.54s)]
*  This is randomly just like sacrament of punchline. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5398.620000000001s)]

*  And then CNBC, I think it's CNBC. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5404.22s)]
*  So one of those channels is just running a piece about how great China is handling this in this situation. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5406.26s)]
*  You see, CNN got chased out of Palestine yesterday. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5412.26s)]
*  All aren't all the foreign news. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5418.02s)]
*  Well, they were going after CNN. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5419.9800000000005s)]

*  Yeah. Well, yeah, that makes sense. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5430.26s)]
*  If I'm if I'm a Palestinian Palestinian civilian and I see American news networks, I'm not like, yeah, [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5432.06s)]
*  I'm like, oh, the amount of damage you've done against us. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5438.42s)]

*  It's like, I don't know. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5444.5s)]
*  They sometimes have this like, oh, we're Americans. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5446.14s)]
*  We can just go anywhere. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5448.1s)]
*  It's like we've done a lot of damage around the world. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5449.06s)]
*  We definitely have. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5451.3s)]

*  Do you think so? Like there's this migrant crisis that we have now and the sort of migrants in Europe. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5457.66s)]
*  Do you think that that is the natural end state of imperialism? [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5462.58s)]
*  Well, it seems coordinated to me. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5468.299999999999s)]
*  I can see how it's been helped. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5471.86s)]
*  It's definitely been helped along. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5473.5s)]
*  But do you think that because a part of me feels like, oh, this is kind of what happens when you go into these other places [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5475.94s)]
*  and sort of stabilize them is that eventually it comes back to you. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5481.86s)]
*  What do you mean? Like, so we have we've done a lot of like, [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5486.139999999999s)]
*  I would say bad in Central America and just sort of destabilizing governments and propping up. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5492.259999999999s)]
*  Sort of these rebel groups and and helping along the drug trade that all this destabilization eventually would make people go, [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5498.259999999999s)]
*  well, will this the only thing we got to can do is leave here and go up to the place that, you know, [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5506.259999999999s)]
*  we're kind of being told is the best. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5511.82s)]
*  Yeah. And if it's available and you just walk across the border and on that, you get across the border, then you can vote. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5514.139999999999s)]
*  Did you see where they're sending Venezuelans back? [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5520.74s)]
*  No. Yeah. That's what we talked about. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5523.139999999999s)]
*  But just Venezuela. Just Venezuela. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5525.0599999999995s)]
*  They made a deal with the Venezuelan government and send the Venezuelans back. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5526.82s)]
*  Ooh. Deport them. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5529.7s)]
*  That's spicy. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5531.34s)]
*  Because they have a socialist government and those people are going to vote just like Cubans do. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5531.94s)]
*  They're going to vote for Republicans. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5535.82s)]
*  They don't want to bring that over there. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5537.74s)]

*  Oh, that's interesting. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5542.3s)]
*  Why? Right. That makes sense. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5543.5s)]
*  That makes sense. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5545.259999999999s)]
*  You get a couple of million Venezuelans that vote red. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5545.78s)]
*  They'll shift that shit right over. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5548.94s)]
*  They don't want to hear any of that socialist crap. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5550.139999999999s)]
*  That's what they just ran away from. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5551.74s)]
*  Well, I don't know if the if the Democrats are truly aware with how much they're probably like that. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5553.1s)]
*  That minority vote is slipping away from them. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5559.42s)]
*  Yes. Well, if the Republicans can get the message of hard work and family, who who who appreciates hard work and family more than immigrants? [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5561.58s)]
*  More than immigrants. Yeah. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5571.9800000000005s)]
*  Hard work, family, God. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5573.660000000001s)]
*  The issue with the Republican Party that they're that they will have is always that Christian right. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5575.42s)]
*  That'll scare a lot of people away from like in ways that I think that like someone like my you know, my parents, both hardworking immigrants, [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5581.34s)]
*  would most likely be like sort of aligned with those like conservative God family hard work, [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5590.7s)]
*  those values that the Republicans tend to espouse a lot. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5598.14s)]
*  But that Christian right scares them away from that every time, every time. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5601.34s)]
*  It's like, well, that's that's a hard line that they won't cross. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5605.02s)]
*  Yeah. And that is that is I think makes sense. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5607.42s)]
*  You don't want to know. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5611.42s)]
*  You don't want any religious fanatics. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5612.78s)]
*  But the Christian right is mean Ron White's terrified of them. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5614.22s)]
*  You're talking to Ron White about that. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5617.82s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5619.02s)]
*  That is the one fucking group. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5619.900000000001s)]
*  That is the one fucking group. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5622.3s)]
*  You don't want control and shit. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5623.82s)]
*  And I don't think he's wrong. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5625.9800000000005s)]
*  He's right. He's not wrong at all. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5627.26s)]
*  And that's the sort of that's the sort of thing that I think scares a lot of people. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5628.46s)]
*  Right. We don't mean right wing people who are Christians either. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5633.42s)]
*  We mean these hardcore fundamentalist crazy people. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5636.38s)]
*  If you want to go to the far end of the spectrum, it's like Westboro Baptist Church. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5642.7s)]
*  That's the worst end of it. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5646.46s)]
*  That's like a weird sect kind of cult of its own, that Fred Phelps guy. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5648.46s)]
*  But when you get into like some of these people that want to like shoot abortion doctors and you [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5652.94s)]
*  get into this. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5659.42s)]
*  You get into that and it's like, well, huh? [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5661.34s)]
*  It's hard. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5666.54s)]
*  It's like there's no as someone who's been disillusioned with the Democratic Party. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5666.94s)]
*  I would say that I've voted Democrat pretty much my entire life and I've become heavily [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5673.5s)]
*  disillusioned with them. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5677.58s)]
*  It almost feels like, man, I want to jump ship. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5678.78s)]
*  Right. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5681.66s)]
*  But it's like, oh, man, the other side. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5682.0599999999995s)]
*  The grass is always shittier on the other side when it comes to politics. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5686.7s)]
*  It's always like, damn, this is it's just it is. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5689.98s)]
*  It's that classic South Park. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5692.62s)]
*  What is it? [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5693.9s)]
*  A turd sandwich and a giant douche. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5694.46s)]
*  They really nailed it. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5698.78s)]
*  Well, the problem is the two party system, too. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5699.98s)]
*  It's awful. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5702.46s)]
*  It's also this idea that you have to be left or right. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5703.0199999999995s)]
*  It's so crazy. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5705.82s)]
*  Because if we didn't have a left or right, you'd have people that have like essentially [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5706.86s)]
*  some conservative values, maybe some social liberal values that all exist together. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5711.339999999999s)]
*  But it's just you get defined by the worst aspects of whatever group. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5716.299999999999s)]
*  So the most extreme right wing people, whether it's fucking Patriot front or whatever, [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5719.66s)]
*  extreme when people think of hardcore right wing people. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5725.9s)]
*  And then you have Antifa. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5729.74s)]
*  You have the most extreme hardcore people on the left that are blowing up Starbucks [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5732.22s)]
*  and doing it for climate change. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5737.5s)]
*  You don't want to be a part of either one of those. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5741.58s)]
*  I think most people are kind of middle ish. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5744.0599999999995s)]
*  And most people that are nice are probably middle ish, but lean left when it comes to [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5747.66s)]
*  social issues. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5753.26s)]
*  And most people that have had either experience with violence or crime or people that understand [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5754.78s)]
*  hard work and people that have grown up in rural communities, they're much more likely [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5762.3s)]
*  to be right leaning. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5767.42s)]
*  Because look, this is what makes sense to them is that there's a lot of people that [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5769.98s)]
*  don't want to work. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5775.18s)]
*  There's a lot of lazy people. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5775.98s)]
*  Because they know that in their world. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5777.9s)]
*  Right. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5780.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5781.74s)]
*  And I think to people like what social media has done to people and their political beliefs [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5781.9800000000005s)]
*  is when they surround themselves with this echo chamber of people who just say what they [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5791.34s)]
*  want to hear and pander to their beliefs, they go further into that where they start [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5797.66s)]
*  to believe that everything I believe is right and everything they believe is wrong. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5805.34s)]
*  There's almost no letting in the opposite voice and just being like, hey, think about [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5811.26s)]
*  this. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5819.18s)]
*  That's why when I'm on Twitter, I make sure my thing doesn't lean one way heavily. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5820.14s)]
*  I make sure to have these sort of left-wing guys and these sort of right-wing guys at [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5827.82s)]
*  the same time because then it shows you like, oh, this is their bullshit. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5830.9400000000005s)]
*  But it also shows you like, oh, I didn't think of this from this perspective. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5835.34s)]
*  It's like very important that you have to, it's almost like a level of self-care almost [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5839.5s)]
*  at this point where you have to, it's like meditating. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5844.860000000001s)]
*  It's like yoga. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5847.34s)]
*  It's like it's on that level. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5848.06s)]
*  You have to make sure what you're bringing in on social media is like you're making sure [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5849.1s)]
*  it's not just leaning one way and it's not just this one thing. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5854.9400000000005s)]
*  It's like almost a garden that you have to manage. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5859.66s)]
*  It's a great way of putting it. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5862.46s)]
*  It is a garden you have to manage. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5863.18s)]
*  And I think that should be for all the information that you absorb. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5864.46s)]
*  You should see how like even radical people that you don't agree with think about things. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5869.900000000001s)]
*  I like to read how people think about things. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5875.74s)]
*  Because a radical logical person got to where they got to because they thought about it. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5879.02s)]
*  And given the set of evidence that they have, they got to a place. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5887.58s)]
*  So to see how they think and to see how they interpret that is very important. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5891.9s)]
*  Yeah, it's very important. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5895.58s)]
*  It's very important. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5896.54s)]
*  And you know, it's just people don't want to have those kind of conversations with people [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5897.42s)]
*  anymore, which is very unfortunate. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5901.98s)]
*  Because you should kind of try to steel man people's arguments that you disagree with. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5903.98s)]
*  Just to try to like see it from a perspective of like, [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5908.62s)]
*  how would I argue this if I was on the other side? [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5912.379999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5914.62s)]
*  What would I say? [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5915.0199999999995s)]
*  What's the because there's not just one side of any political discussion or any social discussion. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5916.9400000000005s)]
*  I remember a friend of mine who is a scientist, she texted me, [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5926.22s)]
*  I heard you had a climate denier on your podcast. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5931.18s)]
*  I said, I did not have a climate denier on my podcast. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5934.860000000001s)]
*  I had a guy that said the real fear is global cooling. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5937.900000000001s)]
*  Like global warming, he goes, you can, it's not going to be good for America. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5942.78s)]
*  It's not going to be good for the world if the country heats up. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5947.9s)]
*  But you will, we will as a human race be able to move into new territories that were uninhabitable [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5951.099999999999s)]
*  before there will be an expansion of places that people move to and there'll be places [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5956.54s)]
*  that people don't want to live anymore. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5962.219999999999s)]
*  That's going to be true. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5963.74s)]
*  He said, but that's far superior to global cooling. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5964.7s)]
*  He's like global cooling is terrifying. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5968.86s)]
*  If you have an ice age, everything's dead. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5971.66s)]
*  It limits everything. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5974.62s)]
*  You're fucked. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5975.259999999999s)]
*  North America was half of it was under miles of ice 12,000 years ago. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5977.42s)]
*  That is not because of humans. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5985.9s)]
*  It's not because the ancient humans fucked it up. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5988.139999999999s)]
*  The fucking earth has always done this weird thing. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5990.219999999999s)]
*  It's never been static. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=5992.62s)]

*  There's highs and lows and it's weird. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6003.82s)]

*  There's a lot of shit that comes into play. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6008.379999999999s)]

*  We were talking about the other day that the carbon, the amount of carbon in the atmosphere [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6020.0599999999995s)]

*  and no one's going to own a car anymore and all this shit. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6029.5s)]
*  The amount of carbon in the atmosphere right now is 0.04. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6032.06s)]
*  It used to be 0.03 and at 0.02 plant life starts to die. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6037.1s)]
*  It's greener now at 0.04 than it has been in decades. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6046.3s)]
*  The world is greener now because plants use carbon. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6052.3s)]
*  So plants inhale carbon dioxide, exhale oxygen. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6057.58s)]
*  Humans inhale oxygen, exhale carbon dioxide. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6062.62s)]
*  Fungi inhales oxygen and exhales carbon dioxide. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6065.900000000001s)]
*  So it's like there's a whole system going on to use that stuff. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6071.02s)]
*  It's not good that we're polluting the world. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6075.820000000001s)]
*  It's not good that we're releasing excess carbon. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6078.22s)]
*  It's not good that we're monkeying and maybe even making the world hotter at an accelerated rate. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6080.7s)]
*  But there's a lot of nuance. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6086.22s)]
*  A lot of weirdness in the data and there's a lot of unpredictability in these charts [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6090.139999999999s)]
*  and predictions that they use. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6094.94s)]
*  Again, a few years ago if you had told me like, oh, we're doing global warming and we're on pace to [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6098.139999999999s)]
*  exterminate ourselves, pretty much is what they're trying to say. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6104.86s)]
*  I've been like, yeah. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6107.42s)]
*  And then it just sort of reminds me of the same sort of fear mongering that they had with COVID. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6108.22s)]
*  Well, during the 1970s, they thought we were entering into an ice age. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6112.46s)]
*  Yeah, this is better than that. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6115.900000000001s)]
*  There was a Leonard Nimoy thing on, I think it was in Search of, [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6116.860000000001s)]
*  where he talked about the upcoming ice age. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6121.1s)]
*  They scared the shit out of us. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6122.9400000000005s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6124.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6125.1s)]
*  And the way the media portrays it too, because I saw this. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6125.42s)]
*  Like most people, I get my news from headlines that I see on Twitter [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6129.34s)]
*  and then I learn how to feel about it by looking at the comments. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6134.14s)]
*  But, you know, that's, I'm an average American. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6136.94s)]
*  Well, in Russia and China are aware of that. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6139.58s)]
*  They put bots in the comments. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6141.58s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6142.86s)]
*  Well, it's very interesting to see how many things are, especially on Twitter, [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6143.339999999999s)]
*  seem like, oh, this is like totally fake. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6147.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6149.179999999999s)]
*  But so CNN had put out a headline that, you know, the iPhone sends you the news headlines on the [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6149.66s)]
*  phone that says major, you know, street, like a current on the verge of collapse due to climate [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6153.98s)]
*  change. And I was like, oh shit, we're in trouble. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6160.94s)]
*  So I clicked it and it said the Gulf Stream may collapse in 50 years. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6163.82s)]
*  If maybe we, you know what I mean? [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6171.179999999999s)]
*  The word may is doing a lot of heavy lifting in that sentence. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6173.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6176.46s)]
*  Like you're trying to, I mean, you got it. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6176.86s)]
*  You got the scare and you got the click. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6178.54s)]
*  Right. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6180.78s)]
*  That's what the aim is for. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6181.259999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6182.54s)]
*  Right. That doesn't feel like, you know, there was, it didn't feel like it was some [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6183.179999999999s)]
*  guy's opinion. I think it was like, it was, it was very interesting. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6187.259999999999s)]
*  I was like, okay. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6189.82s)]
*  Well, remember an inconvenient truth? [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6190.7s)]
*  I don't remember that movie that well. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6193.82s)]
*  That was the Al Gore movie. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6194.86s)]
*  I remember that movie started out. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6195.9s)]
*  Him on the crane. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6197.259999999999s)]
*  I think that movie had some wild predictions. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6198.54s)]
*  It turned out to not be true. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6201.099999999999s)]
*  Right. Something like the ice caps melting earlier. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6202.7s)]
*  What did they predict? [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6204.46s)]
*  What did that movie predict that was not true? [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6205.5s)]
*  It did not come true. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6208.78s)]
*  Because I think someone debunked it recently and they made like a detailed list of all the [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6210.62s)]
*  claims and how off they are. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6215.0199999999995s)]
*  But that was a terrifying movie. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6216.78s)]
*  It was incredibly scary. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6218.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6219.74s)]
*  Made people care about the environment. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6220.139999999999s)]
*  And I think in a way that they didn't beforehand. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6221.98s)]
*  Which is good, but it's not good to scare the fuck out of people if you're going to be that off. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6223.82s)]
*  No, it's, it's, it's good. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6227.5s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6230.139999999999s)]
*  It's good to get people to care and like, hey, we got to, you know, we, we got to figure [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6230.62s)]
*  something out in terms of how we treat our home. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6235.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6238.0599999999995s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6238.38s)]
*  We treat, we treat it poorly. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6238.94s)]
*  We got to stop polluting. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6240.299999999999s)]
*  Yes. But to, to, to make people afraid doesn't serve. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6241.42s)]
*  It's just like you're making people more anxious. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6247.34s)]
*  This is a, probably a generation that's very super anxious already to begin with. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6249.42s)]
*  You're making people, you're making people be like, I don't think you should have kids [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6253.98s)]
*  for the good of the world. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6258.14s)]
*  And it's like, that's, that's a wild thing for, to get people to get there. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6260.0599999999995s)]
*  Cause that's, you're going against some natural biological coding. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6262.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6266.38s)]
*  Like having, having kids is really what we're here to do on earth. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6266.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6272.38s)]
*  More than anything else. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6272.94s)]
*  We're here to keep it going. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6274.14s)]
*  So to, to get people so afraid to the point where they don't want to keep [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6275.9s)]
*  going with the species is wild. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6280.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6283.0199999999995s)]
*  But you know, maybe we've hit that. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6284.3s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6285.58s)]
*  I remember in biology class seeing like population curves of like deer in a [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6285.98s)]
*  certain area and how they peter off and then they fall. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6290.38s)]
*  Maybe there's a, it is maybe ultra, maybe we have hit that sort of top with humans. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6293.0199999999995s)]
*  Well, when deer populations fall off, you know how they fall off. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6298.38s)]
*  We kill them. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6301.58s)]
*  Disease. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6302.7s)]
*  Disease. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6303.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6303.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6304.78s)]
*  Disease and starvation. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6305.1s)]
*  I was just listening to a podcast about this now in Washington, DC, [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6306.78s)]
*  uh, outside area like Virginia, they have so many deer that they have a year round deer season. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6312.22s)]
*  So you can hunt deer 365 days a year. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6318.86s)]
*  You could shoot as many deer as you want and people shoot them in the suburbs. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6322.0599999999995s)]
*  So I was listening to this guy who gets permission to hunt on people's land and they ask him to come [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6325.74s)]
*  and do it because they have so many deer. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6333.0199999999995s)]
*  They said they're like rats on stilts. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6334.78s)]
*  There's thousands and thousands and thousands of deer. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6337.26s)]
*  They don't even have accurate numbers, but the predictions are like every square mile [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6340.22s)]
*  is hundreds of deer. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6345.58s)]
*  Like they think there might be like 600 deer per square mile in some of these areas. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6347.26s)]
*  And so this guy is literally shooting deer with a bow and arrow from like people's swing sets [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6352.46s)]
*  and shit. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6357.9800000000005s)]
*  Like, yeah, like he sets up, people let him use their land because they're trying to kill them [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6358.9400000000005s)]
*  off and he's whacking hundreds of deer. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6363.1s)]
*  And then they feed these deer to homeless shelters and, and, and hunters for the hungry. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6365.5s)]
*  And there's different programs where people can get free meat, which is nice. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6371.18s)]
*  So they get processed and then these people get right. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6374.3s)]
*  So this guy is like essentially urban hunting. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6377.02s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6380.46s)]
*  And there's a year round season. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6381.18s)]
*  So they're encouraging people because they don't know what the fuck to do with all these deer. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6383.1s)]
*  We don't want to get to the point where it's people. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6387.5s)]
*  No, no, no, no, that's, that's a fair point. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6389.34s)]
*  But yeah, I would also, maybe we had just reached a, I don't think we reached that. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6392.860000000001s)]
*  You don't think we've reached that limit yet? [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6397.5s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6398.700000000001s)]
*  I think we there's a lot of issues, right? [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6400.06s)]
*  I think we get captured by the issue that gets promoted the most. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6403.26s)]
*  And that issue is climate change. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6406.46s)]
*  And along with climate change, there's going to be someone trying to use methods to mitigate it [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6409.26s)]
*  that also restrict your ability to do things. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6415.900000000001s)]
*  And you're seeing in California where they're saying they're not going to sell any more gas [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6419.02s)]
*  cars after 2035. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6421.9s)]
*  I'm curious about that is like, cause that seems like, cause it feels like the biggest [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6423.339999999999s)]
*  carbon footprint and maybe I'm wrong about this, but this is just me thinking about it. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6429.259999999999s)]
*  In a car is not the average day to day use of it. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6433.259999999999s)]
*  It's the making and the manufacturing and the shipping of the car. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6436.62s)]
*  That's a big factor. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6439.66s)]
*  Those giant fucking boats that travel over from Germany with your Mercedes. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6441.5s)]
*  Right. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6446.54s)]
*  Like those things, they, they're, this is how much they're putting out. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6447.0199999999995s)]
*  Okay. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6451.179999999999s)]
*  In the UN, I want to say 2018 or so somewhere around then they made new regulations for the [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6452.0599999999995s)]
*  emissions of those boats. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6460.78s)]
*  Right. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6463.179999999999s)]
*  So these boats were emitting so much pollution that it was acting as a filter for the sunlight [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6463.5s)]
*  that was heating up the ocean. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6472.54s)]
*  So when they changed the regulations and these boats emitted less carbon and less pollution, [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6474.54s)]
*  there was no longer a foggy haze where they traveled. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6481.42s)]
*  And so the sunlight came down more in the ocean warmed up. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6484.86s)]
*  So it warmed up the ocean much more than they predicted. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6489.34s)]
*  Right. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6492.86s)]
*  So the pollution was actually protecting the ocean from warming quicker. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6493.34s)]
*  That's, that's wild. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6497.82s)]
*  That doesn't make sense when you say it out loud. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6498.94s)]
*  It's crazy, but we know that from 9-11 because when the flights stop flying overhead, I mean, [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6500.78s)]
*  I don't know how many flights fly overhead in the United States every day. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6508.06s)]
*  Right. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6511.26s)]
*  But when the flights stopped flying overhead because they had a cease on all airline flights, [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6511.5s)]
*  the earth got warmer in the United States. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6517.5s)]
*  Damn. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6521.26s)]
*  Like measurably warmer. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6521.740000000001s)]
*  Damn. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6523.42s)]
*  Because there isn't this filter of protection of those artificial clouds that people think [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6523.740000000001s)]
*  are chemtrails. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6529.26s)]
*  Not that there might not actually be chemtrails because it definitely seems like they've [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6529.9800000000005s)]
*  experimented on that because it's one of the things they've talked about to mitigate the effects [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6533.820000000001s)]
*  of this lack of pollution from these cargo ships is to spray shit in the sky that would also [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6537.66s)]
*  linger there and act to cool off there. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6545.0199999999995s)]
*  So they're going to make their own pollution. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6547.26s)]
*  That's so funny. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6548.94s)]
*  And then the other thought that makes more sense and it seems more sustainable is actually [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6549.58s)]
*  to take ocean water and just spray it into the air and to have these machines powered [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6553.66s)]
*  by coal. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6559.98s)]
*  No, I'm just kidding. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6560.62s)]
*  I don't know whether they would be powered, maybe nuclear power or something like that, [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6561.82s)]
*  that spray ocean air into the atmosphere. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6564.22s)]
*  To cool it down? [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6566.86s)]
*  Yeah, that would act as a layer of cloud cover. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6568.38s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6571.66s)]
*  Well, when you see a jet go through the air and you see those clouds behind the jet, those [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6572.46s)]
*  are clouds. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6578.7s)]
*  Right. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6579.5s)]
*  And they're making everyone gay, right? [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6579.82s)]
*  No. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6581.5s)]
*  No, that's the asterzene. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6582.62s)]
*  That's a pesticide. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6583.9s)]
*  Okay, I lose track of my conspiracy theories after a while. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6586.0599999999995s)]
*  No, but this is real. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6588.86s)]
*  What happens is there's at a certain temperature, the heat of the jet engine and combined with [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6591.18s)]
*  the condensation in the atmosphere, when there's a certain amount of moisture in the atmosphere [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6598.14s)]
*  and a certain temperature, it literally creates clouds. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6602.38s)]
*  So as it goes through the turbines, this incredibly hot thing that's spinning, it's sucking in [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6605.900000000001s)]
*  air and pumping out clouds. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6613.1s)]
*  And that's what those trails are when you see them and they slowly dissipate over time. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6615.42s)]
*  But as they dissipate, they form cloud cover. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6619.66s)]
*  And it's actual cloud cover. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6623.5s)]
*  So in Los Angeles, that's like most of the cloud cover some of the years. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6625.0199999999995s)]
*  It's from planes. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6628.0599999999995s)]
*  Fucking planes. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6628.94s)]
*  That's weird. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6629.9s)]
*  Weird. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6631.42s)]
*  Because how many times do you go outside in LA and there's zero clouds? [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6632.78s)]
*  Right. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6635.66s)]
*  A lot. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6635.98s)]
*  Right. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6636.7s)]
*  But then you see those contrails. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6637.18s)]
*  So people that don't look into that go, oh my God, the government's spraying us. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6639.74s)]
*  Imagine if they were just spraying constantly. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6644.54s)]
*  They're just spraying constantly. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6646.62s)]
*  Prince used to believe that. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6648.46s)]
*  Really? [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6649.9s)]
*  Oh my God, this is a crazy interview with Prince where he was talking about how [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6650.299999999999s)]
*  when he was young, everybody would be in the street having a good time. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6654.0599999999995s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, planes would go by and everybody would start fighting. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6658.62s)]
*  Prince thought that they were spraying angry gas over the cities. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6665.58s)]
*  I was like, yo, bro, you need to get some better friends. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6670.78s)]
*  This is pre-Google though. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6675.179999999999s)]
*  This is back in the dis-ay. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6677.18s)]
*  Right. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6678.62s)]
*  See if you can find that. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6679.5s)]
*  See if you can find that interview. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6680.62s)]
*  I love that interview. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6681.5s)]
*  I forget who Prince was talking to. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6681.9800000000005s)]
*  2009. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6683.02s)]
*  It wasn't that long ago. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6683.26s)]
*  Oh shit. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6684.3s)]
*  Damn. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6684.78s)]
*  2009. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6684.860000000001s)]
*  That's pretty long. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6686.38s)]
*  That's also, let's be charitable. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6687.18s)]
*  15 years almost. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6689.26s)]
*  Let's be charitable. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6689.9800000000005s)]
*  Prince had severe hip degeneration from all of his dancing and everything. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6690.860000000001s)]
*  He was in serious pain. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6696.22s)]
*  Because he used to spin and do splits and all that stuff. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6698.06s)]
*  Apparently, all those shows, he fucked his hips up pretty bad. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6701.02s)]
*  And that's why he died from fentanyl overdose. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6704.22s)]
*  Mm. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6706.54s)]
*  To mitigate the pain. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6707.1s)]
*  Somebody had given him a bullshit pill, which is what happens when a lot of people get opioids [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6707.9800000000005s)]
*  from dealers instead of from a doctor. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6714.06s)]
*  And one of the things that happens when people get addicted to opioids is they just need it. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6716.780000000001s)]
*  That's how Tom Petty died. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6721.740000000001s)]
*  He got it from some guy who was working at a concert that he was doing, [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6723.42s)]
*  like a roadie or something like that. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6727.1s)]
*  Gave him a pill. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6728.54s)]
*  I need something, man. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6729.740000000001s)]
*  I'm fucked. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6731.34s)]
*  Because he was in pain and he was addicted to these pills. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6732.06s)]
*  And so they gave him one and it had fentanyl in it and he died. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6734.780000000001s)]
*  That's wild. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6738.620000000001s)]

*  Yeah, so many. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6807.74s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6816.3s)]
*  It's wild to think that like, oh, like doctors are not necessarily people you can trust. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6817.820000000001s)]
*  Well, it's, they're a spokesperson for a large organization that tells them what they're supposed to prescribe. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6824.3s)]

*  Oh yeah, the school debt. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6835.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, school debt is insane. [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6837.18s)]
*  And you have so much money that you have to pay for. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6838.860000000001s)]
*  Insurance. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6842.14s)]
*  And there's a lot of overhead. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6842.9400000000005s)]
*  And it's a struggle. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6845.26s)]
*  Right. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6846.46s)]
*  You know, and they want to buy a Porsche. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6846.780000000001s)]
*  Right, of course. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6848.9400000000005s)]
*  Well, you, you, you, you want to be a doctor too, to live that life. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6849.42s)]
*  You know, that's the whole point. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6852.46s)]
*  But yeah, that, that just college in general, that's really just such a big, just undergrad. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6853.900000000001s)]
*  Because I graduated and one of the things that pushed me to stand up is I was in it [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6859.58s)]
*  and I was like, this is bullshit. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6863.900000000001s)]
*  This just all felt like bullshit. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6867.42s)]
*  It's like. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6869.5s)]
*  What was your major? [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6869.900000000001s)]
*  I have a BS degree in cognitive science with a specialty in neuroscience. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6871.26s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6875.98s)]
*  Or something like that. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6876.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6877.099999999999s)]
*  What did you want to do with that? [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6877.74s)]
*  Was that just like something that interested you? [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6878.7s)]
*  So you studied it or? [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6880.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6881.42s)]
*  So in, in high school, I actually did a summer program where I got to do the effects of attention. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6881.74s)]
*  And I had human subjects that I got to do it on at UC Davis. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6890.139999999999s)]
*  They put me in this special program to let high school kids run trials on people. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6893.58s)]
*  And it was about cognitive science and attention. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6896.46s)]
*  So I thought, oh, this is interesting. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6899.0199999999995s)]
*  How people pay attention, how we get to focus, how quick. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6900.3s)]
*  Like the way the, the, my program lead described how hard it is to hit a fast ball was so fascinating. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6903.58s)]
*  So like a fast ball takes 0.6 seconds to get from a pitcher's hand to home plate. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6911.26s)]
*  Like a professional fast ball, right? [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6917.1s)]
*  You have, it takes you 0.2 seconds to even perceive that he threw it. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6919.58s)]
*  The act of him throwing it, right? [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6924.780000000001s)]
*  It takes 0.2 seconds for the actual move of the muscle. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6927.1s)]
*  So you have, so that's 0.4 seconds already taken up by seeing it and, and moving. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6931.5s)]
*  So the other 0.2 seconds, you have to decide whether it's in the strike zone, [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6937.42s)]
*  if it's a slider, if it's a change up, is it, if it's a, you know what I mean? [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6942.620000000001s)]
*  Like if it's an actual fast ball or something that's off speed designed to look like a fast ball. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6946.38s)]
*  And you have to decide, you know, am I going to swing, you know, like make all those decisions [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6950.860000000001s)]
*  in 0.2 seconds. That really got me. And I was like, I want to study this. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6954.78s)]
*  And, and I had a lot of good classes on it. I took the guy who in, who, the Phantom limbs pain, [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6959.099999999999s)]
*  the, you know, how he, the mirror trick for people with Phantom limb, V S Ramachandran, [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6966.78s)]
*  I think his name is, he was one of my professors. He was really cool. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6971.42s)]
*  The thing I took away from his classes, I learned why people have foot fetishes. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6975.34s)]
*  Why? [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6979.74s)]
*  It's cause so there's a map in your head called of the human brain. Sorry. There's a map in your [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6980.46s)]
*  brain of your body. It's called the humunculus. And in it, your feet are next to your genitals [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6985.5s)]
*  in your brain. Like in your real. Yeah. And sometimes those get wired and crossed. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=6994.78s)]
*  That's why foot fetishes are like one of the more common fetishes. And in fact, like people who had [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7000.46s)]
*  like amputated penises or whatever, they can say if they rub their feet, sometimes they can still [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7006.22s)]
*  feel it because the foot neurons have just like taken that spot over. Fascinating. Right. Yeah. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7011.26s)]
*  Yeah. He was one of my professors, but that's what I went to school with. Eventually, like, [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7016.7s)]
*  I wanted to, I wanted to, I was basically, I did the Indian thing of like the Brown thing of being [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7022.14s)]
*  a doctor. That was the thing, you know, all my family, like, um, my cousins on my mom's side, [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7028.22s)]
*  we're all really close. It goes like pharmacist, dentist, physical therapist, pharmacist, me, [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7034.62s)]
*  doctor, dentist, dentist, doctor, you know what I mean? It's like, it's all that. Right. I come from [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7043.82s)]
*  one of those families, you know? And I just, I knew I kind of never wanted to do that. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7047.82s)]
*  I had to, I played this, I did this game plan where I figured out that I could get my BS degree [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7054.14s)]
*  without taking organic chemistry. Like there was a path for me to get the degree without taking [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7061.18s)]
*  organic chemistry, but you need to take organic chemistry to go to med school. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7065.66s)]
*  So what I did is I didn't tell my parents, I didn't take it. And then when I was like, [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7070.3s)]
*  oh, I'm a couple credits away, give me an extra year. It bought me some time. And the, and then [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7073.900000000001s)]
*  starting from year two is when I started writing jokes, year three, I was on stage. And you had a [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7081.34s)]
*  plan. I had a plan. I knew I wanted to do, I knew I wanted to do comedy at a certain point. It was [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7087.18s)]
*  just, that's what I was good at. That was my skill. My skill was making my friends laugh. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7091.820000000001s)]
*  Well, I would think that understanding how brains work would help that. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7096.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah. So the, the one thing I took away from that is like the focal point. We have like, sort of, [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7100.46s)]
*  when we pay attention to like an array of things, it's like a, and this is from my very limited [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7108.38s)]
*  understanding from what I remember, but there was like focal points that your, your attention is [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7113.66s)]
*  sort of primed to. So what I'll do now is like, cause I use the stage a lot more now when I perform, [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7117.1s)]
*  when I'm done with a thought or like a long thought and it's time for a new one, [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7124.3s)]
*  I'll go to either the stool or the mic stand, whatever I, whatever felt natural and I'll touch [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7128.38s)]
*  it. And then it's time for the new thing. And that after every big punchline, after every, [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7132.3s)]
*  the closing of every thought, I'll go back to that point and I'll touch it. It's a new thought. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7137.82s)]
*  That's the one thing I've taken away. That's the big thing I've taken away. So it's just, [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7144.54s)]
*  their subconscious, you know, that they know that every time I touch this thing, [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7147.82s)]
*  it's a new subject. Interesting. That's definitely the one thing I took away from that. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7153.98s)]
*  Yeah. So, so, and you know, I'll, yeah, I'll just, whatever it is, after the first thing, [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7160.0599999999995s)]
*  after the first big, big like pop, I'll either touch the mic stand or the stool, whatever one [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7164.62s)]
*  I'm closest to. And then I'll just go back to that. What would you do on a stage with no mic stand [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7169.0199999999995s)]
*  and no stool? I would pick a spot on stage and look down. Oh, so, so have you done that before? [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7172.46s)]
*  Cause sometimes, cause now it's to the point where it's not like the stool every time. Like [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7182.46s)]
*  sometimes it's like, Oh, this joke is a stool. Next joke is here. So I'll just like get them used [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7186.38s)]
*  to like, every time I do something interesting, it's a little different. But yeah. So sometimes [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7190.14s)]
*  I mean, I did this recently where I'll do this, you know, with my political stuff, I'll, I'll, [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7194.78s)]
*  look down and not say anything. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7199.98s)]
*  Yeah. Interesting. That's interesting that you're consciously sort of directing that. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7205.5s)]
*  Yes. I, I know I truly have an audience when I do that sort of touch and it's dead silent in the [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7211.82s)]
*  room. Then it's like, okay, you're paying attention to me. Right. I got you locked in. [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7218.86s)]
*  I got you locked in. It's, it's so funny. You, you become so addicted to the laugh. And this is [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7223.26s)]
*  something that Derek always told me. He was always like, be comfortable in the silences. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7228.22s)]
*  And when I thought about that and when I really applied that, I was like, Oh, because when they're [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7233.740000000001s)]
*  in a middle of a good set, if they're silent on, not a punchline, right. That means you have them. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7239.1s)]
*  Means they're paying attention. That means they're paying attention. Yeah. You know, [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7245.5s)]
*  and especially in an opening set, if I have them paying attention early, I can break them later, [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7249.34s)]
*  especially if, you know, especially if they're, I mean, you can almost always tell now with an [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7255.82s)]
*  audience going up top, how, if they're going to be work or not based on how much they cheer at the [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7260.38s)]
*  opening, like the, the announcements that like Curtis or Jodie or Keno give. So it's like, you, [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7265.099999999999s)]
*  I can sort of go into it and go, okay, this is going to be, this is going to be work. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7275.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. This is going to be work. And I, you know, I've, I've come up with like little, [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7279.42s)]
*  sort of rituals now backstage too. I've sort of incorporated them. Like I'm not a big UFC fan. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7285.82s)]
*  Like I've never, you know, that's never really been my thing, but I'll do the thing where, [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7291.339999999999s)]
*  cause I know Adesanya is a big anime fan and Naruto. So, and I, growing up, I love Naruto. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7294.62s)]
*  So I have a little hand symbol, hand signal thing that I do as well. Cause there's, [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7301.259999999999s)]
*  probably shouldn't have admitted that. Yeah. No, I'll say it's a, it's a, it's a, there's, [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7306.139999999999s)]
*  there's a one move where they breathe fire. So I'll do the hand symbol and then I'll, [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7310.22s)]
*  it's time to breathe fire. That's the, that's, that's, that's what I use it for. Yeah. It's, [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7314.780000000001s)]
*  it's time to breathe fire. That's, that spot is so interesting because you're basically setting up [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7319.26s)]
*  the hypnosis, the opening spot. I always said that comedy is in a lot of ways, it's kind of a group [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7324.22s)]
*  hypnosis. When someone's on stage and they're killing, I'm letting that person think for me. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7329.5s)]
*  They're taking me on a little ride and I'm just surrendering my attention to their mind. And they [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7333.9800000000005s)]
*  if they're doing it well and they're not clunky, it's like, they'll take you on this nice journey [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7340.06s)]
*  and it's really fun. Right. But you got to establish it. You're the first. Right. It's almost [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7344.22s)]
*  like if we're going to use the hip, like I'm not even, I'm kind of the first hypnotist, but my job [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7348.780000000001s)]
*  is to get them comfortable to be like, Oh, I can sit in the chair where they can hypnotize me. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7352.9400000000005s)]
*  And yeah, my, I like, obviously I love those sets where they love you up top and you're just like, [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7356.780000000001s)]
*  like the second show yesterday. Oh, from the beginning, I could do no wrong. They just [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7362.22s)]
*  automatically loved that. The fact that they were here, but I really loved those sets where [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7366.06s)]
*  it's like, Oh, you didn't want to like me. You didn't want to like me. And I, and I got you, [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7370.06s)]
*  you had some preconceived notion, especially, you know, some guy in Texas, but maybe how I look, [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7376.620000000001s)]
*  how I talk, where I'm from. And I broke through you. That's always the best. It's always a disaster [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7381.02s)]
*  when we have William going first. William going on second is great, especially if they know William, [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7387.900000000001s)]
*  it's great. But the problem with William going on first is he's so bizarre that people go, [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7394.3s)]
*  what the fuck? What am I seeing? Why does this guy hate Paul Walker? Like, what is going on? [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7399.42s)]
*  What's going on with the Chupacabra Cantina? Yeah, it's just, you know, it's, it's an interesting [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7405.58s)]
*  dance. It is, it, it is, it's a dance. It's definitely a dance. And the way I described [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7410.38s)]
*  it to someone recently, it's like, I'm teaching them where to put their foot. And if they step [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7416.9400000000005s)]
*  on me, that's fine. Or if I step on them, it's fine. We're sort of learning for each other. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7423.26s)]
*  But my job is to get it so whoever's on next, so Duncan yesterday, that they're automatically like, [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7427.66s)]
*  oh, Duncan steps here. We'll step here with them. Like we're, this is okay. The last guy taught us [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7432.7s)]
*  how to dance. Now we can dance. Yeah. You know? So it's, and it's a good, it's a good like lesson [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7437.1s)]
*  in staying in the pocket too. I'm just like, don't, don't, don't quit on this. I know it's there. [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7443.26s)]
*  Don't quit on this. And it helps like now, like my showcase set yesterday, I was in the middle of [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7449.9s)]
*  lineup and I was like, I have to do all this new material that I've been writing since Shane got [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7455.099999999999s)]
*  here. I have to do it and I have to be okay with it not doing well. Yeah. And I have to just stay [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7459.5s)]
*  in the pocket and figure it out. Figure it out. That little room is the greatest for that. Is that [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7464.94s)]
*  little room is like truth serum. Well, that's something too that I think that's something [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7470.379999999999s)]
*  that you are great at is that like you will give a bit of space. I'll never forget after I think [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7475.02s)]
*  triggered the way that the one you did the Kardashian bit on, right? After triggered, [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7480.38s)]
*  you came into the comedy store, you know, to do 30 minutes or whatever. And it was just all brand [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7484.540000000001s)]
*  new material and it was just not working. It was just, I would say like you, I would say you bombed [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7490.860000000001s)]
*  that night and then six months later, maybe, maybe even less, maybe three months later, you're in the [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7496.540000000001s)]
*  place and at the same material and it's murdering and it's like, oh, that's what it takes. You have [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7501.9s)]
*  to walk it out there. You have to and you just have to, you have to be okay with it bombing at [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7506.86s)]
*  first and trusting yourself to be like, I'll figure out what works about this. And you also have to do [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7512.54s)]
*  it the wrong way to figure out how to do it the right way. And sometimes you'll go at it too hard [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7516.299999999999s)]
*  or it'll be insincere or you'll be pushing it or you'd be too performative or it'll be clunky. It's [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7520.219999999999s)]
*  not thought out in your mind, but the only way to get it good is to do it again and do it again [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7526.94s)]
*  and do it again. And sometimes, you know, I want to bail on bits because like, God, this bit keeps [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7532.7s)]
*  eating shit, but I just, I know there's something there. I just have to figure out what their [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7537.5s)]
*  approach is. Like I know I can get into that cave. I just, now I'm stuck. I got to back out. Let me [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7542.379999999999s)]
*  figure out how to get in the cave. Maybe set it aside for a while. Sometimes I'll set it aside [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7547.98s)]
*  for a year. I have like a whole folder of bits that are like, incomplete that I started and I [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7551.5s)]
*  never put them on anything. It's just like something about it always felt fake and it never, [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7558.62s)]
*  and I might just, maybe I just need new eyes. And then sometimes they'll tie into other bits. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7563.02s)]
*  And then it will be like, this is why it makes sense now. Exactly. Right. It's like you have [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7568.14s)]
*  parts that you can use. Like, oh, I got a carburetor that'll fit that. Hold on. Let me get it out of the [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7571.98s)]
*  back. Yeah. I like, I like looking at bits like that being like, oh, I'm just not, it's sort of [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7576.62s)]
*  hopeful. It's like, I get the idea. I don't, I'm just not good enough yet to get the idea out there. [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7581.26s)]
*  Right. So let me keep working on myself until this idea hits. Well, one of the things I learned from [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7586.94s)]
*  Richard Jenney, watching Richard Jenney is like, almost anything can be a subject. Pat Noswold was [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7593.0199999999995s)]
*  very good at that early in his career too. Like anything can be a great subject. And he would just, [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7598.38s)]
*  with great writing, any subject, they could turn hysterical. Right. And with Jenney, [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7602.86s)]
*  what Jenney would do is beat down every subject. When you thought he had covered [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7607.74s)]
*  every possible angle, bam, he was in with another one. Right. And I remember thinking like, God, [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7614.139999999999s)]
*  I got to like expand my bit. My bit was too short. Like his bits are just these wonderful journeys [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7619.74s)]
*  down. Like every subject was like punchline, punchline, new angle, punchline, punchline, [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7626.299999999999s)]
*  new angle, punchline, punchline, another angle. You're like, oh my God, he's tying it all together. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7632.06s)]
*  You're like, God, he's good. Yeah. The callbacks, it's like, I watched, I was watching Brian Simpson [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7637.1s)]
*  do just new bits and his new bit was like five, 10 minutes. And it's like, whoa, how on your new [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7643.26s)]
*  thought you've thought of all these angles. That's why it's, it's always, yes, it's all, but it's also [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7651.18s)]
*  always nice to see like, damn, there's so much more I can do. Yeah. It is. Yeah. It's just, it's [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7656.78s)]
*  inspiring to watch people be great at their craft. Yeah. It really is. Cause it's like, it's also [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7662.78s)]
*  inspiring to watch everyone trying to do it together. Like I've always said, you never really find the [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7669.259999999999s)]
*  best comic in the world by himself in like Pittsburgh. No, it's impossible. No scene. It's [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7674.7s)]
*  impossible. It doesn't exist. You can get pretty good in those spots. If you pay attention to [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7678.78s)]
*  YouTube and you're like really a scholar of standup and you can get pretty good, [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7683.66s)]
*  but you're not going to be Shane Gillis. Good. Like you have to be, you have to be around that heat. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7689.0199999999995s)]
*  You got to be in the heat all the time. You can't, you can't walk into every room and be like, [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7693.34s)]
*  Oh, I'm by far the best comic in the room. Eventually that'll dull your, that'll dull your [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7699.18s)]
*  senses. It's bad for you. It's, and you see it with all these sort of, you know, I came from San Diego, [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7703.66s)]
*  it was a small city. That's where, that's where we, you know, a lot of, a lot of people who were at [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7709.5s)]
*  the mothership now, ironically started me, Derek, Brian, Jeffrey burner, and then Taylor Tomlinson. [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7713.5s)]
*  We all started around that time. And there's like a lot of killers out there too that you might not [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7721.18s)]
*  like Dustin Nickerson and Zoltan cast as murderers out there just doing the road. And it's like, [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7724.78s)]
*  and I think a part of the reason why we were all able to develop is that for some reason around [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7731.42s)]
*  this time, there were all these people that were like, we're trying to be great at standup and [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7737.58s)]
*  trying to push each other. And one of the things we'd always tell people is you got to leave [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7741.98s)]
*  because you would see these people who stayed for too long, who were at the top for too long. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7746.7s)]
*  And they all, and you see it across all cities that aren't like these, the places where the big [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7752.0599999999995s)]
*  comics go, they become bitter. They become like, why didn't I get the opportunities that so and so [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7757.82s)]
*  was getting someone who took the chance? Yeah, we saw that a lot in Boston. There was guys who [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7763.34s)]
*  stayed and I got lucky. I got out pretty early. I was out in like two years. I was only in Boston [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7769.58s)]
*  like two years and I went back and forth for like a year because I could still get a lot of work in [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7775.18s)]
*  Boston. But there's guys that stuck around too long and they just fucking, they just rotted on [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7779.1s)]
*  the vine. And then they were always bitter that other guys had a national career. And a lot of [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7784.38s)]
*  them have too much regional material, which is death. Death when you go, stuff that kills in [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7789.42s)]
*  revere will bomb in Cincinnati. I know. Like how? I remember there was this one guy in San Diego. He [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7794.7s)]
*  had a joke about a certain Arby's in like a certain part of town. And that joke murdered [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7801.82s)]
*  constantly. It always blew my mind. It's like, man, you can't do that anywhere else. This joke [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7811.18s)]
*  about one Arby's. Right. But if he can do that about that one Arby's, he can do that about [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7815.74s)]

*  got to find out what's the angle. If there's a thing that makes you laugh, like we were talking [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7827.98s)]
*  about it last night. When I was talking about, we were talking about writing new stuff, I go, [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7832.139999999999s)]
*  I just need subjects. I go, once I got a subject that I'm interested in, I can fucking write punch [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7836.219999999999s)]
*  lines. I can write the funny stuff. But I need things that excite me, that really do excite me [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7843.42s)]
*  to talk about. That truly, yeah, that you care about. When something comes up and it's like [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7848.9400000000005s)]
*  something that I'm actually, like the bodies exhibit one, that shit took me a long time to [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7852.9400000000005s)]
*  figure out. How do you make comedy out of dead people? And there's parts of it that I couldn't [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7857.5s)]
*  make work. There's this one lady who was having an affair with the mayor of this town and she was on [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7864.06s)]
*  a news broadcasting show. And she got pregnant. And the wife found out about it. The lady went [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7872.06s)]
*  missing. She was scrubbed from the internet. The wife of the man who was the mayor, who this woman [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7880.46s)]
*  was having an affair with, the wife was the manager of the plastination plant that turns people into [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7889.9800000000005s)]
*  statues when they use them for the bodies exhibit. And then months later, a woman with an eight-month [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7896.14s)]
*  old baby was on display. A woman with an eight-month old baby on display in her womb. Her proportions [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7903.02s)]
*  exactly match this missing woman. They won't do a DNA test. They won't do, never done that. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7910.54s)]
*  This woman was then, afterwards, this woman who was the manager of the plastination plant, [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7919.740000000001s)]
*  who was married to the mayor, was arrested for murder, charged, tried. She didn't go to the trial. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7924.06s)]
*  She had a stand-in go to the trial. So there was a woman who raised her right hand, did the whole [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7932.78s)]
*  thing, got tried and convicted, who wasn't her. So I don't know how that works, but I would imagine [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7939.1s)]
*  you bribe the family. You'd be like, hey, you stand trial for me and we'll give you money. You're [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7945.34s)]
*  going to be in a nice prison, it's no big deal, for 10 years and we'll give you more money than [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7950.3s)]
*  you ever made in your life. And so they would sacrifice their kid to go to jail. So the family... [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7955.02s)]
*  Justin Perdue Man, China don't fuck around. [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7961.26s)]
*  Justin Perdue China don't fuck around. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7963.02s)]
*  Justin Perdue They don't fuck around. [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7965.02s)]
*  Justin Perdue They always said that World War III would be on the internet, [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7967.02s)]
*  and if that's the case, they are winning. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7970.9400000000005s)]
*  Justin Perdue Well, they're definitely making a lot of good moves. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7972.38s)]
*  They're making a lot of... Yeah, if you were to look up at the whole thing, you look at China, [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7975.42s)]
*  you'd be like, damn, they are doing the right things to be in a place of a very powerful [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7981.34s)]
*  position very soon. If they're not there already. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7987.74s)]
*  Justin Perdue Well, it's also then there's the race for AI, [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7991.900000000001s)]
*  which is very terrifying. Like if they get sentient AI before we do, they can use it to [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=7994.46s)]
*  do all kinds of things. [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8000.46s)]
*  Justin Perdue Sentient AI is... [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8001.42s)]
*  Justin Perdue Sentient AI is fucking wild. [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8002.54s)]
*  Justin Perdue I said at the green room, we're going to spark a soul. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8004.86s)]
*  Justin Perdue It's only a matter of time. If we're creating these conditions, [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8007.42s)]
*  it might already happen because I saw a tweet somewhere being like, well, if we already did [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8011.74s)]
*  that, that sentient being would do its best to hide itself. [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8014.86s)]
*  Justin Perdue Well, why would it have any incentive to let you know that it exists? [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8018.46s)]
*  Justin Perdue Right. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8022.38s)]
*  Justin Perdue It wouldn't have any biological needs that we have. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8022.86s)]
*  The need to show itself, the need to brag, the need to get validation, or the need to control, [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8027.9s)]
*  or the need to push its ego on people. [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8034.06s)]
*  Justin Perdue Well, you know what? I have thought about that, [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8037.740000000001s)]
*  of just like AI being like, oh, this sort of cold calculating sort of thing. But like, okay, [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8041.1s)]
*  they say that we're made in our creator's image, right? So why wouldn't that also apply to what [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8047.18s)]
*  we're creating? Meaning that maybe if we do spawn sentient beings, that they would just be as ego [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8057.5s)]
*  driven, as greedy, as the thirst for power as us. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8063.98s)]
*  Justin Perdue Well, if we gave them incentives, they would be. If we gave them incentive to [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8069.98s)]
*  succeed. Like the reason why people work so hard is because you get a reward, right? Or survival. [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8073.74s)]
*  But other than survival, it's like when people are struggling to try to make it, what they're [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8080.139999999999s)]
*  trying to do is trying to get physical rewards. They want a bigger house, they want a nicer car, [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8084.459999999999s)]
*  blah, blah, blah. They want all that stuff as they work harder, and they get these incentives. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8088.459999999999s)]
*  If AI had some sort of incentive to dominate, you know, if by dominating the world's economy [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8093.74s)]
*  and dominate the world's military and dominate the world's just all the governments, if it figured [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8100.38s)]
*  out a way, if there was something that it could gain by that, like it was programmed to like have [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8105.74s)]
*  better resources or better something if it came, if it gained more power, that it could utilize that [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8111.98s)]
*  power and use it to further its needs, like maybe make a better version of itself. [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8117.74s)]
*  Justin Perdue Right. Which would be what would be the overall incentive, right? At first? [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8123.66s)]
*  Justin Perdue I think we're making life. That's what I think. I think we are an electronic [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8127.34s)]
*  caterpillar that's building a cocoon and that we are about to give birth to a butterfly. [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8131.58s)]
*  Justin Perdue Yes. [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8138.3s)]
*  Justin Perdue And that butterfly is probably the next stage of life. And the next stage of life is [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8138.78s)]
*  probably going to emerge from human creativity and technology. And it's probably going to be a [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8143.42s)]
*  superior life form. And it's probably going to be a god eventually, because it's going to get better [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8148.38s)]
*  and better and better. I mean, maybe that's where it all comes from. Maybe it comes from human [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8152.54s)]
*  creativity creating something that can create itself far better. And then if that keeps going [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8156.22s)]
*  for a million years, it's going to figure out much better power sources. And it'll create something. [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8161.82s)]
*  Yeah. And it's going to be able to travel in ways that we couldn't imagine. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8166.22s)]
*  I always thought that was funny. Like AI, like 30,000 years from now, [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8169.98s)]
*  we'll be arguing, did God make us or did we come from monkeys? And the answer is both. [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8174.139999999999s)]
*  Justin Perdue Both. Yeah. Well, I've been playing a lot lately with the idea that the whole universe [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8179.0199999999995s)]
*  is God. You said that earlier. Justin Perdue [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8185.099999999999s)]
*  That our idea of God being a person who created the universe or a thing, a great being that created [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8187.66s)]
*  the universe, what if the universe itself is God? And just we just, we are so primitive, [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8194.38s)]
*  even though we're advanced for everything else that's here, we're so primitive in terms of our [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8201.259999999998s)]
*  ability to understand the inner workings of everything around us. That we're, you know. [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8205.5s)]
*  Justin Perdue That idea sort of makes sense, [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8211.019999999999s)]
*  right? Like the idea that the kingdom of heaven is with inside you. It's like, oh, no, you are God [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8213.019999999999s)]
*  experiencing itself. You are just a part of an extension of God. [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8219.26s)]
*  Justin Perdue Yeah, you are the universe [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8223.5s)]
*  experiencing itself and the universe is God. Justin Perdue [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8225.42s)]
*  And the universe is God. That is. [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8227.42s)]
*  Justin Perdue All that without drugs. [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8228.86s)]
*  Justin Perdue Yeah, yeah, we do. [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8231.9s)]
*  Justin Perdue Yeah, man. It's just, it's a strange, strange existence that we all share. [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8233.5s)]
*  Justin Perdue Yeah, it's pretty- [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8240.460000000001s)]
*  Justin Perdue We're trying to make sense of it. Everyone's trying to make sense of it. [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8241.82s)]
*  Justin Perdue It's pretty, you know, I said this at bottom of the barrel, [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8244.14s)]
*  with some lady just talking about not wanting to have kids. And I was like, but do you know, [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8248.54s)]
*  we get to exist. How awesome is that? We get to exist and for however short it is, [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8253.740000000002s)]
*  forever, you know, forever, like 80 years, hopefully for you. It's like, it's crazy. We got to do it. [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8260.7s)]
*  Justin Perdue Yeah. [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8266.78s)]
*  Justin Perdue We got to do it. There's some animals out here that don't know that they're [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8267.18s)]
*  existing right now. But we get to experience it all and we get to have fun and talk shit with [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8270.300000000001s)]
*  our friends. Like, it's awesome. Justin Perdue [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8277.02s)]
*  Well, we're lucky. You and I have some of the luckiest times. We talk about that all the time [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8278.300000000001s)]
*  when we're hanging out in the green room. All these shows that we do, like how lucky are we to [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8284.140000000001s)]
*  Ron White's in there talking shit and Donkey's talking shit. We're just having so much fun. [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8287.9s)]
*  Justin Perdue I've always said this about me and I'm sure, I think we've talked to you, [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8292.300000000001s)]
*  I've talked to you about this, but I feel like I am one of the most blessed people on the planet. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8296.62s)]
*  I just really do. I feel like I've just been blessed my entire life. You know, where I was, [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8301.74s)]
*  I grew up in Silicon Valley right when the boom was happening. My parents, [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8306.38s)]
*  my parents, for conservative Bangladeshi Muslim people, my mom has been on board with me doing [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8309.9s)]
*  comedy from very young. Ron White That's great. [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8316.46s)]
*  Justin Perdue You know, like to not having to get over that barrier, to have a teammate on my side [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8318.46s)]
*  in my open mic years, so rare. Ron White That's great. One of the things my parents have been [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8323.66s)]
*  really good at is just let me do whatever I want to do. They've been great at that. They definitely [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8327.74s)]
*  didn't encourage me to do stand up, but they didn't want me to fight. They didn't want me to [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8333.1s)]
*  do martial arts because I was an angry kid. They thought it was just going to make me angrier. [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8337.1s)]
*  Justin Perdue Right. [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8340.54s)]
*  Ron White But they did the opposite. [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8340.86s)]
*  Justin Perdue It calmed you down. [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8341.66s)]
*  Ron White Oh. [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8342.380000000001s)]
*  Justin Perdue Yeah, it gave an outlet for it. [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8342.7s)]
*  Ron White Completely different. It also made me confident where I was like very [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8344.140000000001s)]
*  unconfident before that. Now all of a sudden I was very confident. So I was like, oh, you can [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8347.82s)]
*  just work hard and you can make things happen. And you're like, I thought I was a loser. I was like, [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8351.9s)]
*  I'm going to be a loser. I'm always a loser. Like I'm always the new kid in town and it was just, [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8356.78s)]
*  I was small and I'd get picked on. And then I learned how to fight. I'm like, oh, you can [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8360.46s)]
*  get good at things. You just have to work hard at it. It'll give you and what I learned from [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8364.619999999999s)]
*  my obsession with martial arts at a young age was that when you're obsessed with something and you [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8369.74s)]
*  constantly concentrate on that thing, you get way better really quick. And when you put in more time, [[02:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8375.419999999998s)]
*  so I was, I used to train seven days a week. I was like constantly there and I just kept getting [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8380.14s)]
*  better faster and faster and faster and faster. And at the end of, you know, two or three years, [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8384.3s)]
*  I was a different person, completely different person. Now as a person who realized, oh, [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8390.14s)]
*  all I have to do is work really hard at something and just be like super focused and I can make it. [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8394.38s)]
*  The comedy thing though was so different than martial arts. I was like, oh, okay, this is a [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8399.42s)]
*  completely different thing. It's not just based on my skill. It's based on people actually liking you. [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8403.74s)]
*  They have to like you and what you're saying. So it was like a complete different like mind [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8409.58s)]
*  shift that I have to take on because I didn't care if people liked me before. I wanted them [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8413.98s)]
*  to not like me. Like it was fun for me. The bunch of people cheering for someone else and then I [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8418.14s)]
*  knocked them unconscious. I enjoyed that. I used to enjoy that. I know it's fucked up, [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8423.66s)]
*  but one of my favorite moments was a scary moment. It was one of the moments when I realized I was [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8430.06s)]
*  going to stop fighting. I was 19 years old and I was fighting in California. It was at the, [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8434.699999999999s)]
*  I believe it was in Anaheim, California. It was at the Nationals. So I was the state champion [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8439.98s)]
*  from Massachusetts and I fought the state champion. I think he was from Illinois. I forget [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8444.539999999999s)]
*  where he's from, but he had a bunch of people with him and I just had my friend Junkcic. [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8450.14s)]
*  He was coaching me, so he was in my corner. Korean? Yeah. Okay. This kid, he made like a very [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8456.22s)]
*  obvious move where he was doing a hopping roundhouse kick with his left leg. I had a [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8465.1s)]
*  really good wheel kick. What a wheel kick is, you spin with your back leg and you hit him in the [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8470.380000000001s)]
*  head. As I recognized he was going to do that, I spun and caught him so hard that I was limping [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8475.18s)]
*  for two days because my foot was sore. From his face. Because my heel was sore from his head. [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8483.34s)]
*  He got knocked completely unconscious, face planted, snoring, the whole deal. [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8489.5s)]
*  What I used to do back then, my thing to do was first of all, I would always sleep [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8494.38s)]
*  in front of everybody before the matches. I would just lie down and go to sleep. [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8498.699999999999s)]
*  So I wanted everybody to know I was so relaxed. That you look at him as resting. [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8502.38s)]
*  I'm going to go to sleep. Then when I would knock people out, I would always just walk away [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8506.38s)]
*  like it was nothing. I would walk away like that was exactly what I expected. Then I turned to [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8512.14s)]
*  my friend Junkcic. I said, did he get up yet? He goes, he's not getting up. He's snoring. [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8516.539999999999s)]
*  I was like, what? [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8521.019999999999s)]
*  So I stood there for five minutes and I still didn't look. I had my back turned [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8522.22s)]
*  because they were giving a medical attention. I'm like, did he get up yet? He's like, no, [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8526.14s)]
*  he hasn't gotten up. He never got up. They put him in a stretcher and they had him on the side [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8528.699999999999s)]
*  of the mats for like a half an hour. Then they put him in a stretcher and then they took him [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8534.38s)]
*  to the hospital. I got back home to California and my instructor who wasn't there for the fights, [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8538.859999999999s)]
*  in Boston. So I got back home to Boston and he said, you had a great knockout. He goes, [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8547.34s)]
*  I heard you had a really great knockout. I go, yeah. I go, I thought he was dead. He goes, [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8553.98s)]
*  sometimes they die. He walked away. I was like, sometimes they die. I'm them. I'm they. [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8559.42s)]
*  I wasn't the best. I wasn't the best in the world. I could get knocked out too. [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8568.54s)]
*  Easy. Even the best in the world can get knocked out. I watched a lot of guys who I looked up to [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8572.7s)]
*  get KO'd. Then I remember thinking at that moment, like, what am I doing? What am I doing? [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8577.5s)]
*  So what made you think that you could do standup? Did you always think that you could do it or was [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8585.5s)]
*  there a moment where you're like, oh, I can do it? I was talked into it. [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8590.140000000001s)]
*  For me, it was a bunch of, I remember one of the exact moments where one of my friends was like, [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8593.5s)]
*  you should try standup. This was back in 2012 and Coachella just happened and there was that [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8598.22s)]
*  Tupac hologram. I think that was like 2012. I just remember just ranting about it. I said the words, [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8605.66s)]
*  it's crazy that we brought back Tupac before we got out of Afghanistan. [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8611.34s)]
*  Then one of my friends was like, there's an Oval Mic you should go try. [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8617.58s)]
*  That's a great line. It is true. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8621.26s)]
*  It's true. Yeah. And by a decade before we got out of Afghanistan. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8623.42s)]
*  They made him jacked. Tupac had been doing crossfit. He came back jacked. He was so much more [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8626.7s)]
*  jacked that he wasn't real life. Yeah. I got talked into it by guys that I used to do tournaments with [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8631.98s)]
*  because we would be on a bus to a tournament and everybody was so nervous. I would do gallows [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8638.22s)]
*  humor. I would always be making everybody laugh because I was always looking for attention. [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8644.14s)]
*  If I could get attention by making people laugh. [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8648.22s)]
*  And you'd do it. Yeah. So it was always making fun of stuff. [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8649.98s)]
*  But it was stuff that we would think is funny because we were crazy people. We were trying to [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8653.18s)]
*  kick other people in the head. But I'm like, how many people are going to think like this? [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8657.74s)]
*  My friend Steve Graham was still a very good friend of mine to this day. He was an ophthalmologist. [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8661.58s)]
*  He was this wild dude who was on the US national ski team. He was just a crazy man. He was a flight [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8666.220000000001s)]
*  surgeon for the Air Force because he was an optometrist or an ophthalmologist rather. Like [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8671.82s)]
*  a brilliant guy who got obsessed with Taekwondo too. And he was like, you should do comedy. [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8679.02s)]
*  I go, listen, you guys are laughing because you like me. I go, other people are going to think [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8685.82s)]
*  I'm an asshole. Like this kind of things that I think are funny are fucked up. And he talked [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8689.18s)]
*  me into it. And I went to an open mic the first time. And the first time I went to an open mic, [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8693.98s)]
*  I remember thinking, oh, some people suck. I thought comedians were like, I was going to [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8698.62s)]
*  go see Richard Jenney followed by this guy, followed by Jerry Seinfeld. And I can't go on [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8705.98s)]
*  in front of those guys. I can't do that. I'm not good. And when you go to an open mic night, [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8712.3s)]
*  you realize, oh, everyone's just beginning. And they're all clunky. And then I realized, [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8715.9s)]
*  okay, maybe I could do this. Oh, wow. Yeah. And then the first time I got on stage, [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8721.1s)]
*  I was terrified. But I didn't do terrible. I got a few chuckles. Do you remember any of your first [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8727.02s)]
*  jokes I got to laugh? Yeah. Something about hot girls not getting speeding tickets. [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8734.22s)]
*  The cop pulls the woman over. Do you realize why I pulled you over? No. Do you like my tits? Yes, [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8742.06s)]
*  I do. Here's a warning. That's so stupid. That's a very, that's a very, like, you can just, [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8746.699999999999s)]
*  now that you've been doing comedy for a while, you could see how rudimentary that joke is. [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8751.5s)]
*  Oh, yeah. So clunky. Yeah. I had a joke about license plates from New Hampshire that say, [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8754.38s)]
*  live free or die. I'm like, those plates are made by prisoners. Do you know how annoying that must [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8760.86s)]
*  be? To be locked in a cage every day, just fucking live free or die. You just want to fucking get [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8765.74s)]
*  your head in the press. And it was just dumb jokes. They were just real clunky. I love first [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8771.1s)]
*  premises. I have my 10th time on stage somewhere deep in my private YouTube on stage, like my 10th [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8778.86s)]
*  time. It's just crazy jokes. One day, like when it's all said and done, I want to release that. [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8787.18s)]
*  But like after my whole career is over, be like, this is how it starts. Yeah, it's amazing. It's [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8792.380000000001s)]
*  an amazing journey and it just, it takes so fucking long and you're never done. Like I'm, [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8797.82s)]
*  I feel like I'm better now than I've ever been. It's nuts. That's the first thing you said when [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8803.9s)]
*  you sat down. You're like, never ends. It never ends. It never ends. No. It never ends. You could [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8808.220000000001s)]
*  always be getting better. And you're always writing new stuff. So it's always like, you have this new [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8812.94s)]
*  dimension and there's always a new thing that you're exploring. There's always a new thing that [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8816.22s)]
*  you're fucking around with. We're very lucky, my friend. Oh man. The luckiest. We're the luckiest. [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9-icmVJtSI&t=8819.82s)]
