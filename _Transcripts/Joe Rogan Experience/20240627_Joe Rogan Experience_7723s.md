# Joe Rogan Experience #2069 - Dr. Shawn Baker
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5.8s)]
*  Good. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=9.8s)]
*  We're up. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=10.8s)]
*  Awesome. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=11.8s)]
*  What's up, Sean? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=12.8s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=13.8s)]
*  Good to be back, Joe. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=14.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=15.8s)]
*  You're still alive. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=16.8s)]
*  You've been eating nothing but meat and you're still alive. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=17.8s)]
*  I am still alive. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=19.8s)]
*  Fucking doubters be gone. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=20.8s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=21.8s)]
*  Hey, Joe, before we get started, I just want to say thank you for one, for the stem cell [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=22.8s)]
*  stuff, but also for just having the conversations that other people are not willing to have. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=27.0s)]
*  And I see where they try to cancel you and all the BS and you didn't have to do that, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=31.880000000000003s)]
*  but you let other people have discussions so we're not being censored. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=37.72s)]
*  So just in case other people have. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  I'm sure you've been told that before. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=42.32s)]
*  Well, thank you. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=43.32s)]
*  I appreciate that. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=44.32000000000001s)]
*  It's a weird time, man. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=45.32000000000001s)]
*  It really is. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=46.32000000000001s)]
*  First of all, it's a weird time that a guy like me has a show. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=47.32000000000001s)]
*  It's bizarre that this kind of, you know, that I'm a source of information in some sort [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=49.6s)]
*  of strange way, because that's certainly not what I set out to do. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=55.0s)]
*  Just along the line. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=59.04s)]
*  I'm, you know, I'm curious. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=60.04s)]
*  I wanted to talk to people, you know, including you and this diet. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=61.04s)]
*  And you know, I tell people I'm not strict with my carnivore diet, like Saturday night [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=66.36s)]
*  I had sushi. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=73.2s)]
*  But I'll tell you, I felt like shit afterwards. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=74.2s)]
*  I ate a ton of it. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=76.72s)]
*  I ate so much. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=79.24000000000001s)]
*  I'm a glutton. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  But all that rice, I was like, oh, it just makes me realize like how much better I feel [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=81.72s)]
*  when I only eat carnivore. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=86.44s)]
*  When I just eat mostly meat, I feel so much better. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=88.75999999999999s)]
*  I mean, maybe it's anecdotal. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=93.39999999999999s)]
*  Maybe it's just me and you. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=96.11999999999999s)]
*  And many other people that do it. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=98.32s)]
*  But there's something to it. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  But you're an extreme example because you have been doing it now for how many years? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=102.52s)]
*  So I'm starting my eighth year. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=106.74s)]
*  So just just eighth year. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=109.03999999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=111.2s)]
*  When I came to see you last time, it was almost six years ago. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=112.2s)]
*  So I had been just finished seven years now. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=113.80000000000001s)]
*  So yeah, it's been a while. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=116.36000000000001s)]
*  And people should know that you're you're actually a doctor. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=117.84s)]
*  You're an orthopedic surgeon. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=121.08000000000001s)]
*  And you didn't didn't at one point in time, they took your license away because you were [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=122.52000000000001s)]
*  providing medical information, but you got it back. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=126.84s)]
*  Yeah, it was kind of an interesting thing. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=129.16s)]
*  So when I was I was practicing medicine, busy orthopedic surgeon, you know, plugging away [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=130.64000000000001s)]
*  doing a thing. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=135.16s)]
*  And then I started realizing, hey, I can have people avoid surgery by changing their diet. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=136.16s)]
*  And then their pain went away. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=140.2s)]
*  I was like, you don't need surgery. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=141.2s)]
*  Well, that is not what hospitals want you to do. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=142.2s)]
*  They want you to, you know, keep the keep the engines turning, so to speak. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=144.56s)]
*  And so I, you know, said, hey, look, I want to practice some lifestyle stuff. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=148.0s)]
*  And that ended up, you know, leading to a long battle with myself in the hospital. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=152.88s)]
*  The hospital basically suspended my privileges and went to the state. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=158.44s)]
*  The state said, hey, you can fight this, you know, in our in our sort of state medical [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=161.6s)]
*  board situation or you can get independently evaluated. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=168.12s)]
*  And I said, well, let me just get independently evaluated because I don't I don't I don't [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=171.24s)]
*  see I have a hospital. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=174.4s)]
*  And so that was done. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=175.4s)]
*  It was like right at the time when I saw you a couple of days before. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=176.4s)]
*  And they came back and said, there's nothing wrong with you. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=179.08s)]
*  Go back to work. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=180.60000000000002s)]
*  And so I got that. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=181.60000000000002s)]
*  I got that. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=183.4s)]
*  And then I had to reapply to the board, reapply for a license. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=184.4s)]
*  They granted my license and I renewed it three times since then. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=186.72000000000003s)]
*  So I'm a licensed medical licensed doctor. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=189.28s)]
*  You know, but I just you know, right now I'm not actually actively practicing because I [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=192.0s)]
*  got frustrated with the medical system. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=196.64000000000001s)]
*  I think our health care system has some serious, serious problems, you know, some serious conflicts [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=198.0s)]
*  of interest, some serious. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=202.64s)]
*  I think the the incentives for providing what I think is appropriate health care is is misaligned. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=204.12s)]
*  And so, you know, over the last few years, so we set up a company which is called Rivera [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=210.76s)]
*  and we're licensed in all 50 states. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=214.6s)]
*  We have physicians all across the country and we're basically set up to provide what [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=216.2s)]
*  I call actual health care, root cause medicine, get people off the medications, actually, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=221.32s)]
*  try and fix their disease and not just medicate everybody because we have such a system where [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=226.95999999999998s)]
*  everybody's just like, you know, you go to the doctor, you know, here's your diagnosis, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=232.88s)]
*  here's your drugs, keep stay on the rest of your life, which I think is the wrong course. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=236.39999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I couldn't agree more. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=240.23999999999998s)]
*  What's the name of the company? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=242.39999999999998s)]
*  So the company is called Rivera, R-E-V-E-R-O. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=243.39999999999998s)]
*  And so we raise a bunch of money from from crowdfunding and also a bunch of venture capitalists. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=245.39999999999998s)]
*  And so we've been we've been basically building that. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=249.35999999999999s)]
*  We've got thousands of people that are basically on the waiting list. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=252.23999999999998s)]
*  We launch in a couple of weeks. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=255.12s)]
*  And so, you know, so like I said, it's going to be something that I think will provide [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=256.28000000000003s)]
*  health care as it should be, you know, instead of like I said, instead of the just the symptom [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=261.40000000000003s)]
*  management, putting bandages on stuff, actually getting people healthy. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=265.32s)]
*  Because I think a lot of diseases are reversible. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=268.16s)]
*  And we've seen that all the time. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=271.08000000000004s)]
*  You know, we see that pretty frequently. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=272.32s)]
*  Well, that's one of the most fascinating things about this carnivore diet is how many, albeit [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=273.48s)]
*  anecdotal stories you have of people that had all these different conditions, chronic [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=279.24s)]
*  pain, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic fatigue, all these different issues, skin issues, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=285.92s)]
*  eczema, all these different things that they were treating with medication. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=291.92s)]
*  It wasn't working. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=296.84s)]
*  They were experiencing side effects. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=297.91999999999996s)]
*  They start eliminating everything from their diet except for meat. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=300.44s)]
*  And all of a sudden, these problems go away. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=303.96s)]
*  I mean, there's too many of those stories for it to be ignored. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=306.24s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's I've been astounded by the number of number of, you know, just crazy, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=311.84000000000003s)]
*  crazy things that have happened. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=317.8s)]
*  And again, it's not, you know, it's not that, you know, that is the most profound, rigorous [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=318.96000000000004s)]
*  type of type of science that you can do. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=324.76s)]
*  But it's you can't ignore it at this point. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=326.8s)]
*  There are literally probably hundreds of thousands of people now trying. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=328.48s)]
*  I go over. I've been all over the world now talking about this. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=331.64s)]
*  I get people from Germany and Greece and China and Japan and Africa that have all done [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=333.92s)]
*  this analysis. Same thing. Look, I was sick and now I'm not sick anymore. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=339.44s)]
*  And so whether or not that is enough evidence to say this is a good treatment, I can't say that. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=342.24s)]
*  But you can't deny it's happening. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=349.8s)]
*  And I'm I've been trying to get research done. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=351.20000000000005s)]
*  In fact, there was a study done out of Harvard University two years ago. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=353.88s)]
*  I don't know if you saw that. So there's a guy named David Ludwig, who is a senior author. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=356.6s)]
*  And David, I've talked to him. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=361.0s)]
*  He is the most ethical, you know, just like he does not want any money from industry. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=362.12s)]
*  He refuses to take anything. He's like, I want to make sure I do pure science. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=366.4s)]
*  And they did a study and they looked at two thousand people on the carnivore diet. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=369.88s)]
*  And basically what they saw was like 95 percent of the people, significant [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=372.76s)]
*  improvement across the board. Now, the thing was interesting to me is that diabetics, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=377.03999999999996s)]
*  we had like 225 diabetics in that population. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=381.47999999999996s)]
*  Ninety two percent of them came off all their insulin. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=384.28s)]
*  These are all type two. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=386.44s)]
*  You know, that's that's 100 percent came off all these other injectable [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=387.32s)]
*  drugs, the GLP one receptor agonist, which we've heard so much about lately, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=391.48s)]
*  you know, the ozempics and things like that. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=394.44s)]
*  Some of the glutide, right, came off something called PCSK nine inhibitor. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=396.16s)]
*  No, sorry. The SGLT two inhibitors. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=399.92s)]
*  Eighty four percent came off their metformin. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=402.72s)]
*  So it's just like this is clearly a [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=404.32s)]
*  at least at the very least a therapeutic tool. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=408.44s)]
*  And that's how I push this. I don't tell like, you know, I wrote a book on this. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=411.04s)]
*  I didn't say humans are carnivores. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=414.72s)]
*  I see humans are opportunistic omnivores. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=416.28000000000003s)]
*  If we were if we were living in the Middle Ages and we came across, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=418.20000000000005s)]
*  we're out hunting mammoths and all of a sudden, you know, the ice ages round [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=421.08s)]
*  and we came across a tree full of twinkies. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=424.88s)]
*  I mean, we'd eat that. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=427.59999999999997s)]
*  We'd eat it, right? Because, you know, we would. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=429.84s)]
*  But I mean, it's and you know, there's people, there's obviously people [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=431.71999999999997s)]
*  that eat plants that aren't dead and are doing OK. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=434.15999999999997s)]
*  So we're omnivores. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=436.0s)]
*  But from a disease, you know, mitigation standpoint, I mean, a third [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=436.84s)]
*  a therapeutic carnivore diet is tremendously effective. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=442.44s)]
*  I mean, it's one of the more effective things I've seen across the board. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=445.44s)]
*  So at the very least, you know, you'd say, let's explore that aspect of it, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=448.40000000000003s)]
*  because, you know, like I said, there's people that are suffering. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=453.64s)]
*  And we've got so many people. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=455.6s)]
*  I know we may talk about vegan carnivore, all the you know, everything in between. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=457.04s)]
*  But I think at the end of the day, it's everybody's eating processed garbage. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=460.92s)]
*  I mean, we're just eating bullshit. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=463.64s)]
*  I mean, and that is really one of the problems. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=465.24s)]
*  And the one thing you said this, Joe, when you eat this meat, you're like, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=468.36s)]
*  I don't want that other bullshit because you're actually satiated. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=470.96000000000004s)]
*  And this is a thing that's, I think, problematic, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=474.2s)]
*  because if you look at it, there's a study that just came out now [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=477.32s)]
*  looking at the financial incentive for ultra processed food. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=481.04s)]
*  Why do we have this stuff? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=485.92s)]
*  So you look at the big [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=486.92s)]
*  asset management groups, you know, you've got BlackRock, you got Vanguard, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=489.56s)]
*  you've got State Street and Capital. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=492.48s)]
*  I can't remember the full names of these, but [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=495.48s)]
*  those guys collectively own huge portions of Nestle, Pest Pepsico, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=497.8s)]
*  all these other processed food companies. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=503.64s)]
*  They also have they also have significant shares in pharmaceutical manufacturers. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=505.4s)]
*  So you basically you sicken the population by feeding them garbage. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=509.88s)]
*  And then you just you profit on their on their disease. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=513.48s)]
*  And I think that's what's going on. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=516.92s)]
*  And I think it's really unfortunate. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=518.04s)]
*  You know, and I think, you know, some people make an argument, you know, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=520.24s)]
*  is it is a net is there a net benefit from feeding more people [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=522.4399999999999s)]
*  versus how many people are getting sick? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=525.6s)]
*  And I think there's a point where, you know, the line goes, you know, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=527.68s)]
*  if most people are getting sick from this and only a few people are benefiting, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=530.28s)]
*  then you've you've kind of crossed that line of, you know, does it does it [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=534.32s)]
*  is it for the greater good? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=538.12s)]
*  And it becomes, you know, the realm of almost evil in my mind. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=539.08s)]
*  Well, I think it started out with just trying to make money. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=542.1600000000001s)]
*  I mean, that's that's what started out with the processed foods. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=545.48s)]
*  And I think then they realize, well, now you're selling more medication to these people. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=548.5600000000001s)]
*  So you make more money on top of that more money. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=553.44s)]
*  I don't even think it's a conspiracy. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=555.6s)]
*  I think it's just opportunity. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=558.4000000000001s)]
*  I think they just look at profits. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=560.48s)]
*  And that's what these corporations are established for. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=562.8s)]
*  That their bottom line is they're supposed to make as much money [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=565.24s)]
*  as they can for their shareholders. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=568.1999999999999s)]
*  That's their responsibility. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=569.88s)]
*  Their responsibility is to have like a cute cartoon guy [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=571.64s)]
*  that sells you sugary cereal because, you know, I was a kid. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=576.04s)]
*  That's what I wanted. I want Cocoa Pops. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=580.24s)]
*  I wanted to break and break and break and bury all that stuff. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=581.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, there's a reason why all that garbage is like it's so addictive. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=584.1999999999999s)]
*  It's so delicious, you know, and it's [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=588.9599999999999s)]
*  clearly targeted for young people. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=592.5999999999999s)]
*  Clearly. Yeah. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=594.5999999999999s)]
*  I mean, that paper that I talked about and I think, you know, it's in that list. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=595.4399999999999s)]
*  That'll give Jamie. But, um, it basically says this is the whole thing. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=598.9599999999999s)]
*  They make tremendous short term profits for their for their shareholders. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=602.88s)]
*  And that's how they do it. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=606.24s)]
*  So, yeah, it's clearly financially driven. You can't blame them. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=607.16s)]
*  I mean, this is what any business wants to do. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=610.68s)]
*  This wants to be successful. Exactly. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=612.0799999999999s)]
*  It's about making money like everything else, really. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=613.56s)]
*  Yeah, that's what they do. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=615.4399999999999s)]
*  I think the cutting the bullshit out is the biggest factor [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=616.68s)]
*  in this whole carnivore diet thing. I really do. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=619.92s)]
*  I mean, I definitely think there's there's obviously meat itself, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=623.12s)]
*  regardless of the bullshit and the propaganda, meat is the most nutrient [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=629.64s)]
*  dense food you can eat. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=633.0799999999999s)]
*  All this crap where they say that meat causes cancer. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=634.76s)]
*  If meat cause cancer, most people would have cancer. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=637.8s)]
*  Ninety five plus percent of the population on earth eats meat. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=640.36s)]
*  And all this propaganda you hear about, you know, you're going to get cancer. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=644.4399999999999s)]
*  You're going to diseases are going to go all these different things. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=649.6800000000001s)]
*  It does not seem to be the case in people that just eat meat. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=652.36s)]
*  When you're looking at my experience, I have not. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=655.9200000000001s)]
*  Again, anecdotal, I've never met anybody that went on this diet [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=658.9200000000001s)]
*  that didn't have a positive result. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=662.7600000000001s)]
*  Everybody that I know that goes on this diet. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=664.48s)]
*  Now, clearly, there's genetic differences. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=666.4000000000001s)]
*  Some people have definitely just people that have that Lone Star tick issue [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=669.72s)]
*  where a buddy of mine has that he got bit by a tick. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=675.5600000000001s)]
*  And he developed an allergy to red meat. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=679.2s)]
*  It's a real pain in the ass for him. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=682.4s)]
*  And it went away. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=684.08s)]
*  He had it for a year and it went away and it started to come back again. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=685.16s)]
*  That but that's rare for most people. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=689.08s)]
*  Red meat is a very nutrient dense food. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=692.56s)]
*  Yeah, that's that's that's absolutely clear. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=697.16s)]
*  I mean, and your point is, you know, if you get rid of the garbage, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=699.52s)]
*  you're going to have you're going to have a benefit, whatever, but I have to go on. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=702.6s)]
*  I think that's clear. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=705.36s)]
*  And, you know, when we talk about because you mentioned you're not totally strict. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=706.68s)]
*  I am, you know, fairly strict, but I'm not religious about it. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=710.68s)]
*  I don't sit there like, you know, for instance, my son's birthday was, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=714.4s)]
*  you know, a couple of days ago and Thanksgiving cake. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=718.0799999999999s)]
*  I had I had a piece of pumpkin pie, man. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=719.8399999999999s)]
*  So I hadn't had had that in 10 years. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=721.7199999999999s)]
*  But I'm like, you know, no big deal. I didn't die. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=723.68s)]
*  But it's not like I said, my diet literally is probably 98 percent red meat. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=725.5999999999999s)]
*  I mean, I just I just eat steaks every day. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=731.4s)]
*  You know, it's kind of crazy. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=733.12s)]
*  Well, the videos are hilarious of you eating steaks, listening to vegan propaganda. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=734.76s)]
*  Yes, you have a big cutting board and a giant cleaver. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=739.48s)]
*  And you're slicing off pieces of tri tip while you're watching vegan propaganda and smiling. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=742.4s)]
*  Yeah, it's pretty fun to do that stuff. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=747.6s)]
*  And I definitely, you know, like I said, if there's anybody that has, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=749.1600000000001s)]
*  you know, like I said, if I'm wrong, I mean, it'll be clear that I've been eating meat [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=753.0400000000001s)]
*  like significantly for for many, many years. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=757.24s)]
*  I put a lot of it on video. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=759.76s)]
*  But, you know, one of the interesting thing is, you know, because the backlash, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=761.24s)]
*  you often hear is, what about cholesterol? [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=764.28s)]
*  Because I think that is a really important thing. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=765.72s)]
*  I really wanted to talk about that. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=767.76s)]
*  Yeah. Awesome. Because there's some, you know, I think you saw that thing about the Oreo cookies. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=768.88s)]
*  Did you see that? Yes, I did. Yeah, let's talk about that. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=772.12s)]
*  So anyway, there's a so there's a little back story in this. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=774.36s)]
*  And last time I mentioned a guy named Dave Feldman, and he was he was a guy that, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=777.4s)]
*  you know, he's an engineer, a pretty smart guy. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=781.0799999999999s)]
*  And he like goes on out like a low carb, you know, higher fat diet. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=783.16s)]
*  And his cholesterol, he feels great. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=786.16s)]
*  He's like, oh, my God, everything feels great. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=787.36s)]
*  But his cholesterol shoots through the roof. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=789.56s)]
*  And he's like, oh, my God, I'm going to die. Right. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=790.88s)]
*  So he freaked out about this stuff. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=792.4s)]
*  And he starts looking into it very mechanistically and spending years and years and years [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=794.4399999999999s)]
*  studying this stuff. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=798.4399999999999s)]
*  And finally puts together this sort of theory and still theory. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=799.8399999999999s)]
*  But it's they're showing that there's a lot of evidence showing that it's probably likely true [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=803.3199999999999s)]
*  called the lean mass hyper responder. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=806.52s)]
*  And there's something called a lipid energy model. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=808.92s)]
*  And so what this Oreo cookie thing was is another guy's another researcher. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=810.52s)]
*  He's a PhD from Oxford. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=814.8399999999999s)]
*  He's getting he's also finishing his medical degree at Harvard. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=816.1999999999999s)]
*  And his name's Nick Norwitz. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=819.8s)]
*  And he basically said, look, this lipid energy model works like this. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=821.16s)]
*  When you cut carbs low and you get lean, right, your body says, hey, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=825.44s)]
*  there's not a lot of energy in my cells. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=830.52s)]
*  My liver glycogen isn't full. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=832.52s)]
*  My muscles are full of energy. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=833.88s)]
*  So I need to get energy there somehow. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=835.96s)]
*  And so what happens is the liver starts sending fat out in the bloodstream. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=837.96s)]
*  I like to say you have energy to work. Right. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=842.36s)]
*  And so what what he's showing is that if I just add Oreo cookies or some other energy [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=844.96s)]
*  dense, maybe junk food in there, the body will say, hey, I've got plenty of energy [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=851.08s)]
*  now. So the liver shuts down. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=856.0400000000001s)]
*  It doesn't traffic the cholesterol anymore. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=857.2800000000001s)]
*  The true let's rise in the cholesterol. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=859.2s)]
*  So that sort of validates what's going on here. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=862.2s)]
*  And so but the question is, is it bad if my cholesterol is really high? [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=864.64s)]
*  But I'm fit. I'm lean. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=869.6s)]
*  You know, I don't have diabetes. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=871.1600000000001s)]
*  I don't have pre diabetes. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=872.2s)]
*  I don't have insulin resistance. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=873.32s)]
*  I don't have high blood pressure. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=874.9200000000001s)]
*  You know, I'm otherwise metabolically healthy because you see these people. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=876.36s)]
*  So you see their lean athletes, you know, they go on a diet like a corn over diet or even a ketogenic diet. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=879.08s)]
*  And they're like, I feel great. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=884.5200000000001s)]
*  It's the best I felt in years. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=886.0s)]
*  But my cholesterol is through the roof. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=887.2800000000001s)]
*  So I got to stop. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=888.4000000000001s)]
*  And so that's the real question. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=889.4000000000001s)]
*  So on December 8th, there's going to be a landmark study that's going to be prevent presented by a guy named Matt Budoff, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=891.48s)]
*  who's a who's a cardiologist out of UCLA. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=898.12s)]
*  I think he's one of the he's attached to UCLA somewhere. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=901.0400000000001s)]
*  And basically what they did was they took 100 people, all who have sky high cholesterol. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=904.12s)]
*  We're talking like total cholesterol, 500, 600, 700 milligrams per deciliter. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=910.36s)]
*  It's enough to give your doctor a heart attack. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=914.96s)]
*  You walk in there with your cholesterol, it's like 600. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=916.6s)]
*  What the hell? [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=918.48s)]
*  So he's got all these patients there that they are all otherwise metabolically healthy, though. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=919.72s)]
*  None of them are diabetics. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=924.44s)]
*  None of them have blood pressure. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=925.48s)]
*  They're relatively lean. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=926.88s)]
*  And what they did was they did high level CT angiography. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=928.5999999999999s)]
*  These people looking really detailed at how much plaques in their blood vessels. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=931.92s)]
*  They're all older guys. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=936.3599999999999s)]
*  They're like average age, like our age, like mid fifties, like mid late fifties. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=937.1999999999999s)]
*  Right. So this is where you'd expect to start seeing heart disease. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=941.16s)]
*  And when they did that scan, almost none of them had any level of significant, you know, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=944.2399999999999s)]
*  ask her to use their like clean, clean arteries. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=950.3599999999999s)]
*  And so so what and what they're doing is they're running them for a year and then they're going to repeat the study. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=952.68s)]
*  Right. And say in one year has anything occurred? [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=958.28s)]
*  Now, the criticism of that will be that, oh, it takes 20 years to do that. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=960.88s)]
*  But Matt Boudoff is like the world leading expert on how fast vascular disease develops. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=964.24s)]
*  Right. So he's a guy that designed the study. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=969.32s)]
*  He knows this stuff. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=971.12s)]
*  So he said a year will show us for sure if vascular disease is going to occur. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=973.0s)]
*  So what they're doing on the 8th is they're showing the preliminary data that shows all these people have almost no heart disease. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=977.32s)]
*  And they compare it to something called the Miami Heart data set, which is like like the like the perfect data set for if you want to compare what's going on with vascular disease. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=984.0s)]
*  And so in February, they'll finish up the collection of data and then we'll get to see what happens after a year. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=994.5600000000001s)]
*  And I suspect what will happen is they'll show no progression, little progression or even reversal, which would be shocking because all these people are saying cholesterol causes heart disease. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1001.24s)]
*  Because if you listen, you know, listen to guys like because I know you got Peter on your purity on here and he says, look, it's just a matter of how much cholesterol over how much time. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1010.0799999999999s)]
*  If it's high for a long period of time, you're going to get heart disease. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1017.52s)]
*  But if this turns out to be what what what I think is going to show, which it likely will show, then that throws a monkey wrench in that whole theory because it's like, wait a minute, maybe it's a dependent variable. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1020.28s)]
*  Maybe if you're not fat, you know, out of shape, have high blood pressure and diabetes, that that LDL cholesterol being high is not as much of a problem as we thought it was, which is I mean, that's really I mean, that's paradigm shifting. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1032.4s)]
*  Well, honestly, where did the theory of LDL cholesterol being bad for you come from? [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1044.3600000000001s)]
*  Well, I mean, that goes back into the I mean, when they started looking at cholesterol, this is in rabbits way back in the like the 1920s or something like that. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1051.0400000000002s)]
*  They started feeding rabbits high cholesterol diets and rabbits got heart disease. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1057.68s)]
*  Well, rabbits don't really eat high cholesterol diets. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1061.0s)]
*  No, they don't. It's an unnatural diet for them. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1064.0s)]
*  But they started looking at, you know, the associational data started out back in the 50s when Eisenhower had his heart attack and everybody's freaking out because, you know, we saw a rise in heart disease, you know, 1940s, 1950s. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1065.6s)]
*  And it's been, you know, it's been a number one killer in Western populations since then. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1077.68s)]
*  And so a guy named Ansel Keys was one of the one of the ones that sort of promoting that theory. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1081.56s)]
*  They did, you know, associational studies where they say, well, look at these countries. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1086.8799999999999s)]
*  They eat a lot of saturated fat and they have a high cholesterol and they die more more commonly of heart disease. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1089.76s)]
*  And so that that basically data has been done over and over again. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1096.6s)]
*  I mean, they've done Mendelian randomization studies, which there are some problems with those those types of things. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1100.04s)]
*  They've done, you know, studies where they can show that, you know, we can lower cholesterol and cardiovascular disease decreases. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1106.04s)]
*  So we know that, you know, that's all premise behind statin drugs. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1114.04s)]
*  Some people think it's a pleomorphic effect or it's like a side effect, like maybe it's decreasing the inflammation and by decreasing the inflammation, you're actually improving heart disease. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1117.6s)]
*  But there's been I mean, there I mean, there's a ton of evidence that would point to. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1125.28s)]
*  Yes, that is what's going on. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1129.76s)]
*  Now, what I would say is, again, you're looking at a general population and the other thing is all cause mortality. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1131.56s)]
*  So clearly there's a lot of evidence that points to like you like normally they like your total cholesterol below like one 90 LDL below 100, something like that. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1137.52s)]
*  But if we look at like population studies and all cause mortality, cancer, heart disease, dementia, infectious disease, so on and so forth, the people with higher cholesterol actually live longer. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1147.04s)]
*  They're the ones that live longer. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1158.12s)]
*  And so the question is, you know, maybe I won't get a heart attack, but I'm going to get cancer instead because my cholesterol is too low, perhaps. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1159.92s)]
*  Now, the critics of that will say it's reverse causality. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1165.48s)]
*  It's like, well, the only reason your cholesterol was low was because you had cancer. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1167.92s)]
*  Right. And cancer is making your cholesterol go down because cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and some of the other lipoproteins actually have a function. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1171.6s)]
*  They participate in our immune response. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1179.04s)]
*  So it's there for a reason. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1181.3600000000001s)]
*  It's not just for the hell of it. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1182.44s)]
*  Right. We have a reason for this stuff. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1183.4s)]
*  And so that you know, but there's a I mean, there's a plethora of studies on this stuff. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1186.16s)]
*  Some of it's been paid for by the pharmaceutical industries, which, you know, of course, there's a little bit of conflict of interest in some of that. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1190.6000000000001s)]
*  You know, I would imagine. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1195.96s)]
*  But again, if you talk to 99 percent of cardiologists, they'll be on board with this. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1197.92s)]
*  But like I said, this sort of population, which we never studied, we have no data on these people. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1203.5600000000002s)]
*  You know, it's like like like if you go on a carnivore diet and I know you've gotten lean, you feel good. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1208.3600000000001s)]
*  Probably your blood pressure is good. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1213.2s)]
*  Probably your you know, your your glucose is good. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1214.9199999999998s)]
*  Is that mean it's dangerous for you? [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1218.8799999999999s)]
*  And the answer is we don't know yet. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1220.8799999999999s)]
*  But this this study will shed a ton of light on this. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1222.28s)]
*  And so this is coming out, like I said, the preliminary data, December 8th, when Budoff presents to the to the big conference. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1225.6399999999999s)]
*  And then and then when they finish the collecting the full data in February, they'll probably publish that probably spring, summer, something like that. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1232.12s)]
*  Are you aware of any of the results? [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1238.84s)]
*  I'm aware of the preliminary data, right? [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1241.32s)]
*  And they're I talked to the researchers and they're like, man, we don't they know the results, but they don't want to share it because they don't they don't the cat getting out of the bag early. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1243.04s)]
*  But it's going to we're going to get it on December 8th. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1251.36s)]
*  And basically, it's going to what I what I think I'm 90 percent certain what it's going to show is people with super high cholesterol that are otherwise super lean and healthy compared to the average population have less risk for cardiovascular disease based on this data. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1253.12s)]
*  That's what I think is going to happen. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1267.1599999999999s)]
*  Now, we'll know for sure on December 8th when Budoff presents. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1268.24s)]
*  There's also an issue with dietary cholesterol and what dietary cholesterol, how it shows up in the body. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1270.52s)]
*  People have this assumption that when you consume dietary cholesterol, it raises cholesterol that you can measure in the blood. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1278.04s)]
*  Yeah, that's that's been shown to be completely in fact, 2015 USDA said no, cholesterol does not cause elevated cholesterol in the blood. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1285.8400000000001s)]
*  That's been shown up because now it's fascinating. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1295.64s)]
*  It was just fascinating. But they'll say what they will say is saturated fat, which often runs with cholesterol, because the only reason only place you get cholesterol is in animal products. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1297.9199999999998s)]
*  And very often you'll get saturated fat in animal products. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1305.68s)]
*  And so they'll say, but it's it's not the cholesterol, but it's actually saturated fat. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1308.48s)]
*  We know that saturated fat was demonized by the sugar industry. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1311.32s)]
*  Yeah. And that bullshit study that they put put out in the 1960s where they paid these guys the equivalent of $50,000 today to lie. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1315.2s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that's that's clearly that clearly happened. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1324.76s)]
*  That was Harvard University, where they basically took a bunch of money to basically demonize fat and protect sugar. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1327.0s)]
*  And I think that's been going on for which is wild. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1333.04s)]
*  The sugar industry bribed those doctors. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1335.36s)]
*  And that information has been the basis that people have been making recommendations on forever on a fraudulent study. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1337.76s)]
*  And still to this day, doctors will cite that not knowing it. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1344.0s)]
*  And when you tell them about it, they're like, what are you talking about? [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1347.52s)]
*  And then you'll show it, pull it up on Google and they just go, huh? [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1350.0400000000002s)]
*  What is this? Like, there's so many doctors that aren't aware that the demonization of saturated fat was specifically caused by these papers by these doctors that were bribed. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1354.64s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. I mean, it is crazy to think how much, you know, you know, you think that science would be a quest to find the truth or to explain the observations around us. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1365.72s)]
*  But a lot of times, you know, science now is marketing. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1377.64s)]
*  I mean, it really is. I mean, it's paid for. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1380.0400000000002s)]
*  Companies are going to benefit from this. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1382.2s)]
*  You know, you think about a lot of these academic institutions, a lot of their funding comes through industry and they don't get funding if they don't get the results that they're they're getting paid for. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1383.72s)]
*  It's even more insidious than that, because the people that are involved in the FDA eventually go and work for these corporations, which is so wild. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1392.8400000000001s)]
*  When you see that happen and you go, oh, my God, there's a clear revolving door. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1402.9199999999998s)]
*  It's not like shell corporations or some secret hidden money overseas. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1407.72s)]
*  No, it's like right in front of your face. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1413.24s)]
*  These people work for the government. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1415.12s)]
*  They make these laws and they make these recommendations and then they go on to get these incredible jobs where they get paid lucrative amounts of money. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1417.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1424.48s)]
*  Golden parachutes. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1424.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1425.6s)]
*  It's crazy that that's legal. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1426.04s)]
*  It's not only I mean, as you probably know, like the FDA, I mean, corporate capture. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1428.3999999999999s)]
*  I mean, the FDA for new drug for new drug approvals, it's like 65 percent of that budget comes from the pharmaceutical industry itself. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1432.2s)]
*  So they're like they're paying to regulate themselves. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1441.52s)]
*  And so it's like so it's kind of crazy. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1443.4s)]
*  And USDA is not any different, you know, because we talk about our food stuff. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1445.04s)]
*  I mean, these guys that go on to become, you know, executive, you know, big people in USDA often do the same thing. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1448.32s)]
*  They'll go into these food companies and they'll have the same sort of situation. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1453.8400000000001s)]
*  And so dirty business. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1457.0s)]
*  Yeah, here's I'll tell you, here's an interesting thing. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1459.16s)]
*  So I've been trying so like Harvard recently came out with a study, nonsense epidemiology, that red meat is contributing to diabetes, increase your risk for diabetes. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1460.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1469.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1469.92s)]
*  And this is a study done by Harvard. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1470.48s)]
*  Walter Willett is has been the chair. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1472.1200000000001s)]
*  He's been vegetarian. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1474.8s)]
*  He's been he's been conflicted for years. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1476.0800000000002s)]
*  But basically what they did was they said, well, we're going to count lasagna as red meat. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1478.04s)]
*  We're going to call it sandwiches as red meat. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1481.64s)]
*  And the people that eat red meat are they're overweight. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1483.6000000000001s)]
*  They're smokers. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1485.76s)]
*  We didn't really correct for that. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1486.3200000000002s)]
*  But the headline is red meat causes diabetes. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1487.72s)]
*  Meanwhile, you've got a study that, you know, that Harvard did three years ago with David Lowe, who says, look, these people are eating nothing but red meat and their diabetes is going away. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1490.6000000000001s)]
*  How can those two things coexist? [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1497.8400000000001s)]
*  Well, what I'm trying to do is get an intervention study done. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1500.0400000000002s)]
*  So I, you know, it's kind of interesting because this is how far what I think the problem is. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1503.6000000000001s)]
*  So I went to something called the NCBA. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1509.2s)]
*  This is a National Catamons Beef Association. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1512.3600000000001s)]
*  This is supposed to represent all the cattle producers in the United States. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1514.1200000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1516.88s)]
*  And there's something called the beef checkoff. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1517.72s)]
*  You remember that beef? [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1519.2800000000002s)]
*  It's what's for dinner. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1520.2800000000002s)]
*  You remember that thing? [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1521.0400000000002s)]
*  It was like Robert Mitchum back in 92. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1521.68s)]
*  And then I think Sam, they got great voices, right? [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1523.8400000000001s)]
*  You know, beef is what's for dinner. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1526.48s)]
*  You know, that that type of thing. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1527.52s)]
*  This is what they're supposed to do. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1529.16s)]
*  So they collect as part of the beef checkoff, like every time a cow moves in the United States, like if you're a cattle ranch and you sell your cow, you got to pay a dollar. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1530.16s)]
*  If it goes to, you know, if it goes to slaughter, so it's got to pay a dollar. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1537.48s)]
*  If it goes to a feed yard, it's got to got to pay a dollar. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1540.24s)]
*  So this is so every year and there's like roughly we slaughter about thirty four million head of cattle every year in the United States, which, you know, interestingly, India slaughters more cattle than we do, which I didn't know that. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1542.12s)]
*  But they do. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1552.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, they have. They slaughter thirty eight million head of cattle every year. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1553.6s)]
*  And you think about India, that's like they're all vegetarian and eating cows. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1557.0s)]
*  They export most of that. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1560.24s)]
*  But they have they have the biggest herd of cattle in the world in India. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1561.36s)]
*  There's three hundred million head of cattle in India. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1565.9199999999998s)]
*  That's insane. I thought. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1567.56s)]
*  So United States are sacred. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1569.84s)]
*  Well, they are in some in some parts of India. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1571.68s)]
*  Right. But they actually slaughter more cattle in India than we do in the United States. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1573.92s)]
*  And they export most a lot of it. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1580.64s)]
*  There's something like southern India. They still eat a little bit of beef. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1582.0s)]
*  In fact, there's a lot of carnivores in India right now. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1584.3600000000001s)]
*  It's kind of crazy. I did conferences in India and it's just like, wow, it's kind of a growing movement down there. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1586.2s)]
*  But back to the point. So so we've got this beef checkoff system. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1591.6000000000001s)]
*  So every cattle ranchers, they pay a buck. Right. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1595.52s)]
*  And then so at the end of the year, they collect 30, 40, 50 million dollars a year. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1597.68s)]
*  It's supposed to be to promote beef, like beef. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1601.5200000000002s)]
*  It's what's for dinner to do research and all that stuff. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1603.2s)]
*  And so I, you know, the U.S. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1605.88s)]
*  Cattlemen's Association, which is that represents the cattle producers, but the NCBA [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1608.68s)]
*  represents cargo and Tyson and the packing things. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1613.44s)]
*  And so there's a little conflict between that. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1616.5600000000002s)]
*  But they have all the money. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1619.0400000000002s)]
*  And I went to those guys to the beef checkoff and I said, hey, look, we want to spend a little bit of money [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1620.24s)]
*  to do a study on beef versus diabetes, because we know the results are going to be the people are going to [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1625.08s)]
*  they're going to go on an all meat diet or close to all meat diet. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1629.3999999999999s)]
*  Their diabetes is going to go away. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1631.84s)]
*  It's simple and it takes all the confusion out because whenever you just you know, you hear all these dietary studies, [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1633.1599999999999s)]
*  it's like, oh, but he was eating hamburgers and french fries and there's all this confounders. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1638.12s)]
*  So it's like you can't really test it. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1642.0s)]
*  I'm like the perfect way to test if meat is healthy or not is to just put them on a damn carnivore diet. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1643.52s)]
*  See what happens. It's the only way to test it. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1648.48s)]
*  Right. Right. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1650.2s)]
*  And epidemiology study, right? [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1650.3999999999999s)]
*  I don't account for sugar, sugar, drink, Coca-Cola, bread, pasta, lasagna. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1652.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, that's exactly that's what Harvard did recently. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1657.32s)]
*  They didn't account for sugar intake when they said beef causes diabetes. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1659.1599999999999s)]
*  Like, you got to be kidding me. You're not even counting sugar. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1661.8799999999999s)]
*  That's so crazy. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1663.6s)]
*  Right. But they but they get this published. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1664.4399999999998s)]
*  And this is really bad science, you know, and guys like John and Ida's, [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1665.8s)]
*  who's who's one of the most cited scientists in the world, has basically said all this epidemiology we're doing, [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1670.0s)]
*  we're just wasting money. It's not telling us anything. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1675.9599999999998s)]
*  It's all garbage. But they keep doing it over and over again because they generate headlines, you know, the headlines they want. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1677.8799999999999s)]
*  But anyway, back to this beef checkoff thing. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1683.1999999999998s)]
*  So I said, hey, look, you know, every year you award money, you know, hundreds of thousands, you know, [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1685.1999999999998s)]
*  tens of millions of dollars to promote beef. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1691.0s)]
*  I said, let's get a little bit of money to do a research study on diabetes. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1692.56s)]
*  And they literally said, no, we're not interested in doing that. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1696.6s)]
*  And I'm like, you got to be kidding me. The beef industry is taking a beating right now. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1699.6399999999999s)]
*  You know, you listen to it. It's like, you know, everybody wants to get rid of beef. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1702.56s)]
*  Their cow farts are boiling the oceans and, you know, it's going to kill you. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1707.48s)]
*  It's going to give you cancer, which all of us is largely nonsense. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1712.72s)]
*  And this is, you know, in my view, this type of study would clearly, clearly demonstrate [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1715.3600000000001s)]
*  that not only does beef not cause diabetes. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1721.8s)]
*  In fact, I talked to the CEO of the NCBA two years ago. I sat down. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1724.28s)]
*  I presented in front of the California Cattlemen's Association and literally the president of the association stood up and said, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1727.24s)]
*  I went on a carbidot and cured my diabetes. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1733.4s)]
*  It's like, yeah, it's clear. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1735.68s)]
*  And the guy said, yeah, I get it. We're going to help you out. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1737.2s)]
*  We're going to get this going. I didn't hear. I heard nothing from these guys. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1739.48s)]
*  So what I think is going on is the USDA kind of oversees all these checkoffs. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1742.24s)]
*  And they just kind of say, look, you can't say that because we want to promote, you know, [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1746.72s)]
*  because again, they have all these processed food lobbies, Nabisco and PepsiCo sitting on the, you know, [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1752.0800000000002s)]
*  they're on the board and they're like, if we promote this one food and people stop eating all this processed food, right, [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1756.68s)]
*  then what are we going to do? We're going to lose a lot of money. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1762.8400000000001s)]
*  You think about it, you know, not that I'm advocating that everybody want to carnivore die, because I don't think that's I don't think it's necessary from, you know, for one. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1764.52s)]
*  But if you significantly cut back on all those people consuming all this garbage, you know, what does that do economically to this country? [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1771.36s)]
*  I mean, you think about how much money is spent on garbage food, the drugs are needed to treat that. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1779.4s)]
*  You're talking I mean, we spent four four point three trillion dollars a year on health care in this country. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1784.72s)]
*  And what do we get for it? We got one of the sickest populations in the world. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1790.6s)]
*  Our life expectancy is going down. Everybody's fat. Everybody's depressed. Everybody's on drugs. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1793.44s)]
*  It's crazy. It is crazy. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1798.72s)]
*  And it's crazy that they don't look to diet as being the primary cause of that. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1800.8400000000001s)]
*  Or if they do, they look to these epidemiology studies that don't take into account exactly what you're eating with the meat. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1805.6000000000001s)]
*  Why is it meat that's always demonized? [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1812.44s)]
*  Well, I think for a number of reasons. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1815.3600000000001s)]
*  If you go back to like dietetics in the beginning, like back in 1917, the American Dietetics Association was formed. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1817.96s)]
*  This was formed literally by Seventh-day Adventists. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1824.5600000000002s)]
*  So that from the very, very beginning, the creation of the nutrition science field, these Seventh-day Adventists who are, you know, religiously vegetarians. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1826.88s)]
*  You know, you go back to like the Kellogg's brothers, you know, John Harvey Kellogg, where he's out there, you know, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1836.0s)]
*  circumcising females and saying, we can't eat meat because it's going to make you have sex and make you have lust and masturbate. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1842.3600000000001s)]
*  This is all like this religious stuff. And then it got... [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1848.72s)]
*  People don't know that, but they should know that he developed this cereal, this bland cereal to discourage masturbation, which is one of the wildest things I have ever heard. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1850.92s)]
*  Yeah, that guy was a wacko, man. He was in there... [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1861.3200000000002s)]
*  You're a wild dude. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1862.76s)]
*  He was giving himself like high pressure enemas every day. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1863.76s)]
*  He was just like fucking 20 gallons a minute enemas because he thought that was something. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1866.72s)]
*  Really? [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1870.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, he was a wacko. He was a really nutty guy. You read about some of his stuff. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1870.56s)]
*  20 gallon enemas? [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1872.8s)]
*  It was some ridiculous, like super high capacity, like a super soaker on steroids thing. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1874.0s)]
*  Just, are enemas bad for you? [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1879.32s)]
*  Because I've always wondered if your internal gut flora is important, and it is, isn't that getting washed out? [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1881.52s)]
*  I think to some degree it is. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1888.72s)]
*  I don't know that anybody's really looked at it from that angle. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1889.8799999999999s)]
*  But I, you know, I think in some cases, like, you know, some people's got some problems with constipation, it could be helpful. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1892.44s)]
*  But I don't think it's generally a healthy practice for most. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1899.24s)]
*  But I know there's people that are like, like putting weird stuff up their butt, man. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1902.1200000000001s)]
*  It's just kind of, it's like... [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1905.08s)]
*  I think it probably feels good to get flushed out. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1905.92s)]
*  It might. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1908.04s)]
*  But it also makes you see everything come out of you, I guess. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1908.56s)]
*  I've never done it. But apparently there's a tube and they look at it. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1911.36s)]
*  Oh, look, here's your problems. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1914.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's kind of like these, there's this thing these crazy vegans do where they, they consume like, like this charcoal and this jelly and stuff. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1916.0s)]
*  And this kind of gruel mix. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1926.1599999999999s)]
*  And then it kind of like fills up their intestines and they poop it all out and they say, that's clearing out all my intestines. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1928.1999999999998s)]
*  I can't remember what they call it. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1932.9199999999998s)]
*  But it's like there's these crazy, crazy videos where they just pull all this like gelatinous black stuff out of their butt. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1933.76s)]
*  But it's like you just ate all that stuff. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1939.8s)]
*  That's what's coming out of you. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1941.12s)]
*  Oh, look, all the toxins. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1942.3999999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1943.8s)]
*  You just ate that, stupid. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1944.36s)]
*  You just ate the same stocks. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1946.6399999999999s)]
*  People are obsessed with that term, like releasing the toxins. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1947.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1951.28s)]
*  You know, they really think that that's what's happening when you sweat and you get in the sauna, you're releasing the toxins like when you're sweating, your body's regulating your heat temperature. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1951.92s)]
*  Yeah, that's what's going on. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1961.5600000000002s)]
*  You know what clears your toxins? [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1963.0400000000002s)]
*  Your fucking liver. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1964.2800000000002s)]
*  That's what that thing's for. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1965.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, liver kidneys. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1967.0s)]
*  And we've got a pretty good detox system for sure. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1967.8000000000002s)]
*  You don't need all the smoothie juice fast detoxes. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1969.7600000000002s)]
*  You know, it's like some people are detoxing when their teeth fall off, they're detoxing their teeth. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1973.2s)]
*  Well, the other thing is with the smoothie thing is my God, you're getting so much sugar and you're getting it in a weird form. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1977.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1984.3600000000001s)]
*  If you're in eating fruit smoothies, you're getting you're getting sugar in a very unnatural form. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1984.88s)]
*  Fruit juices. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1991.2800000000002s)]
*  We just think that fruit juices are really good for you. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1992.2800000000002s)]
*  Most doctors would agree that fruit juices are very high in sugar. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1994.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1998.3600000000001s)]
*  And to get it in that sort of liquid dose where it just goes right in your fucking bloodstream in your liver, that's a lot of sugar, man. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=1998.88s)]
*  Well, you think about it because you're like you're out hunting all the time. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2006.92s)]
*  And, you know, you go when you're going out and you're like, if I had to get food out here, what would I what would I have available to eat? [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2009.64s)]
*  I can tell you what you wouldn't. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2015.0s)]
*  You wouldn't have all this processed food, but particularly like like powder, you know, like we make powdered sugar, we make powdered flour and we combine them together. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2015.96s)]
*  But we've changed the nature of the food so much that it's interesting. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2023.3200000000002s)]
*  You know, I saw Darious was a foreign who's a researcher at Tufts who he's the guy to put out the study that says was part of the study that said, you know, [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2027.04s)]
*  like Lucky Charms are healthier than eggs. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2035.4s)]
*  You saw that last year. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2038.96s)]
*  That's totally. Yes. Right. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2040.0800000000002s)]
*  Hilarious. But one thing he did point out was like over the last 20 years or so, we haven't really been eating much more calories than we were. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2040.96s)]
*  Like from the 1960s to about 2000, we ate more calories. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2048.48s)]
*  And maybe that explains why everybody got fat. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2052.2s)]
*  But since that time, we really haven't eaten much more. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2053.56s)]
*  But we've eaten so much more ultra processed food. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2056.16s)]
*  And in fact, right now, the U.S. diet is close to 70 percent ultra processed, which you think about. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2058.44s)]
*  That's like crazy. And our kids are getting fat. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2063.08s)]
*  But one thing that's interesting is like you because you're talking about the microbiome, right? [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2065.32s)]
*  Our gut flora. When you eat like whole food, you know, it goes farther down your digestive track. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2068.96s)]
*  And then, you know, our microbiome actually consumes some up to up to 22 percent of our calories can be consumed by our microbiome. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2076.52s)]
*  But when you're just eating sugar, it goes straight in you. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2083.64s)]
*  So those calories, your gut microbiome doesn't get any of that. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2086.2799999999997s)]
*  So you're right. It's like you're absorbing more calories. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2088.68s)]
*  So just by changing the quality of the food, you're changing how many calories you absorb. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2091.28s)]
*  And that is what some people say is part of what leads to this obesity thing. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2095.28s)]
*  But we know, like, for instance, well, here's another thing. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2099.8s)]
*  USDA came out with a study like, I don't know, three months ago. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2101.8s)]
*  Ninety one percent processed food diet is healthy. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2106.2400000000002s)]
*  You know, this is what they're pushing, trying to trying to get us because they're trying to position us to study. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2109.52s)]
*  This is USDA put it out. It was probably I think it was the Nova study. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2114.6000000000004s)]
*  I think I might have that on there, Jamie, but it's it's basically because there's there's some there's starting to be backlash against ultra processed fruits. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2117.88s)]
*  I mean, like South America is starting to ban the stuff, which I think, you know, I'm not I'm not for banning food. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2128.76s)]
*  I mean, I think that gets into, you know, freedom of choice and things like that. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2134.1600000000003s)]
*  So you shouldn't be just like you can still smoke if you want to. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2136.96s)]
*  You know, it's not the best for you. So you don't want to do that. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2139.32s)]
*  But at the same point, you know, they're saying like this stuff is there's a lot of backlash. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2142.2400000000002s)]
*  People like myself and probably you and others just saying, look, this ultra processed garbage is literally killing us. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2147.52s)]
*  It's making us crazy. It's making us depressed. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2152.68s)]
*  All these people with mental health disorders, a lot of nutrition is part of that. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2154.96s)]
*  And we can talk about that. But, you know, what they're seeing is there's a backlash against that. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2159.08s)]
*  Yeah. So that's a no, but no dietary guidelines meet Nova developing a menu for a healthy dietary pattern using ultra processed. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2164.2400000000002s)]
*  So they're basically saying, hey, how do we make people eat more processed food and make it, quote unquote, healthy? [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2171.92s)]
*  And they showed that they could make a diet that's like 91 percent ultra processed foods and still be, quote unquote, healthy. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2177.08s)]
*  But it says here, it says the purpose of this proof of concept study was to determine the feasibility of building a menu [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2184.08s)]
*  that aligns with the recommendations for a healthy dietary pattern from the 2020 DGA and includes a over 80 percent. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2190.2799999999997s)]
*  What is that K.C.A.L. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2199.68s)]
*  Kilo calories from U.P.F. ultra processed foods as defined by Nova designed to accomplish this objective. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2201.3999999999996s)]
*  We first developed a list of foods that fit Nova criteria for U.P.F. ultra processed foods fit within a dietary patterns in the 2020 DGA [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2208.7999999999997s)]
*  and are commonly consumed by Americans. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2218.8399999999997s)]
*  We then use these foods develop a set with what is that 7D? [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2221.3199999999997s)]
*  What does that mean? Seven day, seven day, seven day, two thousand kilo calorie menu modeled on the MyPyramid sample menus [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2226.16s)]
*  and assess this menu for nutrient content as well as for diet, diet quality using the healthy eating index. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2233.12s)]
*  The results in the ultra processed DGA menu that was created, 91 percent of the kilo calories were from ultra processed food or Nova category four. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2241.0s)]
*  The H.E.I. two fifteen score was 86 out of a possible 100 points. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2250.6s)]
*  The sample menu did not achieve a perfect score due primarily to excess sodium and an insufficient amount of whole grains. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2255.36s)]
*  This menu provided adequate amounts of all macro and micronutrients except vitamin D, vitamin E and choline. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2263.0s)]
*  Conclusions. Healthy dietary patterns can include most of their energy from ultra processed foods, [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2270.92s)]
*  still receive a high diet quality score and contain adequate amounts of most macro and micronutrients. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2278.2000000000003s)]
*  Boy. Right. So remember USDA, the guys that go there, they leave USDA and they go sit on on the board of directors at Nabisco and PepsiCo. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2286.6800000000003s)]
*  And so this is really I think what this is, is positioning us, is positioning us as a society to accept that ultra processed foods are our food. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2295.1200000000003s)]
*  It's really human pet food. I mean, you see what happens to our pets. Yes. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2302.7200000000003s)]
*  And everybody's fat. So we're going to still we're going to say, well, it's still OK. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2306.32s)]
*  If it's OK, if you eat your, you know, your human dog chow or your human chow, just keep you keep doing that. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2309.1200000000003s)]
*  Don't ask questions. And oh, by the way, here's an ozempic shot or a semi glutide shot. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2314.6400000000003s)]
*  Well, some aglutide shot will give you to to kind of keep you chilled out. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2318.36s)]
*  So it's really I mean, it's almost sinister in a way. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2321.48s)]
*  It's very bizarre. It's very bizarre that this isn't challenged and that shows you how captured our food industry really is. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2324.36s)]
*  The fact that that's not challenged, the fact that our health guidelines aren't set on, hey, [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2333.0s)]
*  what you should be eating is what human beings are designed to eat in nature. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2339.16s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I mean, it is real food. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2344.16s)]
*  I mean, I you know, my opinion on dietary guidelines, because we have a USDA that meets every five years. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2346.2s)]
*  And by the way, so USDA Diet Dietary Guidelines, you see there's a physician from from Harvard named [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2350.6s)]
*  Fatima Stamford. Right. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2359.0s)]
*  And she went on 60 Minutes and said, obesity has nothing to do with diet. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2360.96s)]
*  It has nothing to do with exercise. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2365.16s)]
*  It's all disease and genetic. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2367.36s)]
*  And there's nothing you can literally do. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2369.84s)]
*  And she's also sponsored by Nova Nordisk, who makes ozempic. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2371.36s)]
*  Right. And she's on there. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2375.7200000000003s)]
*  She's also a member of the U.S. Dietary Guidelines panel. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2376.96s)]
*  So 95 percent of the people that sit on the U.S. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2379.8s)]
*  Dietary Guidelines panel today for this next one, when they're going to come up for 2025 guidelines, [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2382.32s)]
*  all have financial ties to processed food companies, [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2386.92s)]
*  which you think about it's just like this is crazy. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2390.12s)]
*  So so why? [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2392.3599999999997s)]
*  So if you go to like Brazil, like Brazil's dietary guidelines, or at least one they released a few years ago, [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2393.52s)]
*  it was like, here's what you should do. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2397.72s)]
*  Cook at home. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2401.08s)]
*  Don't eat processed foods and eat with people around that you love. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2402.64s)]
*  And that's their literally that is their recommendation, which I think is better than our guidelines, [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2406.64s)]
*  because, you know, I mean, if left to our own, you know, I mean, we are now being told [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2410.7999999999997s)]
*  we got to eat all this garbage and it's just making us it's just making us sick. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2414.8799999999997s)]
*  It's crazy. And I think, you know, like, you know, I mean, it's like this is the most. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2418.4s)]
*  Can you remember a time because you and I grew up the same time. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2423.28s)]
*  We're like I turned 57 in six weeks and you're like 56. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2425.2000000000003s)]
*  So we grew up the same time back when we were kids. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2429.08s)]
*  I mean, it's like we were kids. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2431.32s)]
*  We all watched the same fucking shows because there was nothing else on. Right. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2433.12s)]
*  There was what the CBS, ABC, NBC and maybe like PBS. Right. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2435.6s)]
*  Maybe a local news station. That's all you had. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2439.2400000000002s)]
*  So we're all watching Gilligan's Island and a Brady Bunch and Dukes of Hazards [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2441.28s)]
*  and Charlie's Angels and stuff like that. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2445.12s)]
*  And everybody had the same thing. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2447.52s)]
*  But now it's so fractioning. Everybody's divided. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2448.6s)]
*  I mean, I don't know if I can't remember a time when this country's been more divided. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2451.2s)]
*  I mean, can you? I mean, it's just like every single issue. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2454.32s)]
*  Palestine, Israel, you know, COVID shot, not shot. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2457.28s)]
*  Climate change, no climate change. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2461.68s)]
*  It's like everything's a war. It's like crazy. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2463.36s)]
*  But I think part of that is, I mean, I don't think have people's brains work anymore. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2465.52s)]
*  I mean, we're just so nutrient deprived. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2469.44s)]
*  I think that's really true. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2471.6s)]
*  And it sounds crazy to say because people all that's not it. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2472.7599999999998s)]
*  No, it's social media. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2476.88s)]
*  It's I think the mental health aspects of social social media, which are significant. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2478.48s)]
*  There's real mental health issues involved in these posts and commenting [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2484.4s)]
*  and seeking things that outrage you. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2489.56s)]
*  I think it's exacerbated by people's poor physical health. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2492.12s)]
*  Oh, sure. Sure. It's it's, you know, I'm going to go back to mental health a little bit. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2495.12s)]
*  So there is a another guy at Harvard named Dr. Chris Palmer. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2498.52s)]
*  He's a good dude. He's like an Indiana country boy, but he's at Harvard. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2501.96s)]
*  And he just wrote a book called Brain Energy, where he talks about how [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2505.2s)]
*  nutrition metabolism significantly affect mental health disorders. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2509.52s)]
*  And, you know, we've got something like 25 percent of Americans are on a drug [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2513.16s)]
*  for mental health, which is insane. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2516.6s)]
*  I mean, it's like, how the hell do we do we make it through millions of years [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2518.48s)]
*  as a species, you know, or hundreds of thousands of years rather. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2521.68s)]
*  But what they've shown in one study, they showed that, you know, they took like [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2525.12s)]
*  30 people that were inpatient, like psychotic. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2529.16s)]
*  I mean, schizophrenia, manic bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2531.96s)]
*  And they changed their diet. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2537.32s)]
*  They put them on, you know, a clean diet, you know, kind of a lower carb diet. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2538.28s)]
*  And all of them, every single one of them saw a significant [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2542.12s)]
*  improvement in their mental health. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2545.76s)]
*  And so but, you know, what do we do now? [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2547.36s)]
*  You know, if you go to like rehab, drug rehab or you put somebody in an institution, [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2548.8s)]
*  they just feed them garbage and they just keep them perpetuating this horrible [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2553.84s)]
*  when you go to the hospital. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2558.08s)]
*  Yeah. The hospitals are horrible. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2559.2000000000003s)]
*  Hospital is terrible food. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2560.32s)]
*  They give you garbage. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2562.48s)]
*  They give you little fucking things, applesauce and cheeseburgers. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2563.4s)]
*  Yeah. The pancakes with syrup and an orange juice and some jello, [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2566.28s)]
*  like the crappy jello. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2569.84s)]
*  Yeah, it's all bad for you. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2571.2400000000002s)]
*  You don't get grass fed steak. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2572.8s)]
*  No, no, no, no. It's fiber. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2574.8s)]
*  This is this is another thing that always comes up when when I tell people [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2577.6000000000004s)]
*  that I eat only meat. What about fiber? Yeah. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2581.0800000000004s)]
*  Yeah. So that's a that's a good that's a good topic. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2584.56s)]
*  And so what I would say is fiber is conditionally beneficial. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2586.68s)]
*  So if you're eating a standard diet, yeah, you're going to eat. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2590.7999999999997s)]
*  If you put fiber, fiber really is a marker for diet quality. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2593.7999999999997s)]
*  Right. So if I'm if I'm some poor guy and I'm eating this potato chips and cookies, [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2599.64s)]
*  I don't get a lot of fiber. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2603.2799999999997s)]
*  If I got a little more money, I'm probably buying the fruits and vegetables, [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2604.6s)]
*  probably out of guilt. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2607.52s)]
*  But but it generally represents higher socioeconomic status, [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2608.2799999999997s)]
*  better overall diet quality. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2612.68s)]
*  And I think it's beneficial in that situation. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2615.04s)]
*  But if you go like, is it providing anything that I can't get from me? [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2617.16s)]
*  So there was a study that I got in Tommy Wood and the other other [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2620.76s)]
*  researchers was Mailler. I can't remember her first name is female. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2625.44s)]
*  They did a study looking at what happens to the microbiome [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2628.28s)]
*  because we're always hearing, oh, you need fiber to feed your microbiome. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2631.8s)]
*  Right. You need those short chain fatty acids. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2634.08s)]
*  You need the the butyrate or the butyric acid. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2635.64s)]
*  Well, they looked at that and they said, look, the gut has our gut [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2638.8s)]
*  has incredible metabolic flexibility. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2642.6s)]
*  And so even in the absence of fiber, you can get the same short [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2644.84s)]
*  trained fatty acids from protein. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2648.8s)]
*  You can get it from being a low carb state where you have, you know, [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2650.6000000000004s)]
*  more ketones being produced because, you know, the main ketones in our blood [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2653.36s)]
*  is called beta hydroxybutyrate, which is very similar to butyric acid. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2657.6000000000004s)]
*  It's only one, you know, hydroxyl molecule. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2660.44s)]
*  When it reverses all the time. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2663.08s)]
*  So they indicated that that, you know, we don't need fiber [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2664.56s)]
*  for that particular aspect. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2668.28s)]
*  And the other thing, there was a recent study [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2670.0s)]
*  because I see what I see is so many autoimmune conditions. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2672.6800000000003s)]
*  You know, like I know you've talked to Jordan and Michaela and, you know, [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2674.88s)]
*  you've seen these crazy autoimmune conditions, which I've seen in the thousands. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2677.28s)]
*  Now it's crazy, like Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2680.92s)]
*  psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, eczema, asthma, you know, anything [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2683.96s)]
*  that there was a study looking at fiber [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2690.5600000000004s)]
*  actually exacerbating problems with rheumatoid arthritis [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2693.92s)]
*  because of its interaction with a particular bacteria [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2697.48s)]
*  called privatella coprii, I think, or something like that. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2700.2000000000003s)]
*  And so we're seeing, yeah, so high fiber that synergizes [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2703.2s)]
*  and exacerbates rheumatoid arthritis. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2706.8399999999997s)]
*  So basically, you know, it's showing that, yeah, I mean, [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2708.56s)]
*  there can be problems with fiber for a lot of people, particularly [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2712.3599999999997s)]
*  if they have these issues. And so. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2714.9199999999996s)]
*  So when people say that fiber is beneficial, what they're essentially [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2716.64s)]
*  essentially saying is that if you have a poor diet, [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2720.16s)]
*  if you have a diet that's rich in ultra processed foods and garbage, [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2723.2799999999997s)]
*  fiber would be beneficial to you because it would help. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2727.3599999999997s)]
*  What does it do? It helps push that food. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2730.12s)]
*  I think it's displacing the garbage off the plate. Right. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2732.6s)]
*  So if you if you load your plate up with fruits and vegetables, [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2734.68s)]
*  which I think generally I'm not a guy that says vegetables are trying to kill you [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2737.44s)]
*  and nobody. I know there's other people. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2740.72s)]
*  It's kind of funny. The car you talk about cults and carves kind of become a cult. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2742.48s)]
*  Right. And it's not because of me. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2745.44s)]
*  I'm like, I told people, hey, we're omnivores. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2746.68s)]
*  This is a therapeutic protocol. Use it for as long as you like. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2748.52s)]
*  If you want to do it for a lifestyle, have at it is fine. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2750.7999999999997s)]
*  I'm not going to. But I'm but but what I think was happening with fiber [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2753.48s)]
*  in a lot of ways and because fiber goes back to [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2757.6s)]
*  what's the researchers name a blanket on his name. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2761.16s)]
*  He had a cancer named after him. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2763.24s)]
*  But anyway, from 1920s, 1930s goes to Uganda in Africa and notices like, [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2764.3999999999996s)]
*  oh, these people are fat and sick like they are in England. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2769.3199999999997s)]
*  And Burkett, Dennis Burkett, the guy's name. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2772.04s)]
*  And he says, well, oh, they're eating a lot of fiber. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2774.52s)]
*  But they weren't also they weren't eating a lot of sugar. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2777.3199999999997s)]
*  And they weren't eating a lot of garbage like they were in the UK. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2779.08s)]
*  Because sugar has been around since about the 1600s and progressively has increased. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2781.08s)]
*  I mean, the U.S. right now, it's kind of interesting. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2786.04s)]
*  Compared to like the 18 early 1800s, the average kid [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2788.12s)]
*  by the age of something like eight has eaten more sugar than they would have [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2791.84s)]
*  in a lifetime back 150 years ago. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2795.24s)]
*  So it's kind of crazy. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2797.8s)]
*  By the time they're eight years old, the average eight year old [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2798.6s)]
*  has eaten more sugar than somebody would have eaten in their entire life. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2801.8s)]
*  You know, and that's just the normal kids. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2805.24s)]
*  You know, you see some of these kids are just like, I mean, I got. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2807.16s)]
*  Jamie, I got a picture I got to show you. This is so incredible. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2810.08s)]
*  Jamie, there's a there's a gal before and after picture. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2812.48s)]
*  We got this food addiction stuff. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2815.32s)]
*  So I interviewed a gal. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2816.76s)]
*  She was 800 pounds. Right. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2818.5600000000004s)]
*  It's like, how do you get to 800 pounds? [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2820.6400000000003s)]
*  It's like impossible. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2822.4s)]
*  Like I could I don't think I could do it if I tried. Right. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2823.2400000000002s)]
*  I mean, you know, food, food, food. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2825.76s)]
*  And it couldn't stop eating chocolate and ice cream and all that stuff. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2828.1200000000003s)]
*  And this is her. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2832.0400000000004s)]
*  Well, she's almost 800 pounds or 350 kilos, [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2832.84s)]
*  which is the most I've ever deadlifted. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2836.2000000000003s)]
*  So that's kind of an interesting weight. But [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2837.48s)]
*  22 months, she goes on carnivore. Right. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2840.1200000000003s)]
*  I interviewed her a while back, and she's now lost almost 500 pounds. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2842.0800000000004s)]
*  On carnivore, when nothing else would work for her. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2846.92s)]
*  I mean, she literally I mean, she told me it was like, [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2849.7200000000003s)]
*  I finally found the off switch. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2851.96s)]
*  She tried weight loss or she tried like gastric by band surgery. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2853.8s)]
*  She tried vegan diet. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2857.6800000000003s)]
*  She tried juicing. She tried weight. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2859.28s)]
*  She tried everything you could think of, but could never stop. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2861.0400000000004s)]
*  Stop. And finally, for the first time in her life, she's like, [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2864.2400000000002s)]
*  I finally found freedom from this food addiction. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2866.44s)]
*  And, you know, recent studies show that that other guy in the hat. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2869.6800000000003s)]
*  This is a funny guy. This guy in the hat right there. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2873.4s)]
*  His name is what's his name? I'm like Todd. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2875.2s)]
*  He's a dude out in Montana, right? [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2878.24s)]
*  He was 770 pounds, right? Same sort of situation. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2880.08s)]
*  Start drinking cokes when he was when he was 14 years old. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2884.48s)]
*  I'm doing the interview and he goes, yeah, I didn't know. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2887.72s)]
*  I didn't know he was. And he starts telling me he was 14. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2890.16s)]
*  I was 600 pounds. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2892.12s)]
*  Well, what 600 pounds at 14? [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2893.2s)]
*  It's like, how the hell can you get the 400? [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2896.12s)]
*  You know, they're poor family and his mom and sister and everybody in the family [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2898.0s)]
*  is very obese and they had tried gastric bypass and it didn't work for them. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2900.8799999999997s)]
*  But same thing with this kid. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2905.2s)]
*  I mean, he's just like I call him a kid. He's 40. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2906.68s)]
*  He went carnivore for the first time in his life. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2909.3999999999996s)]
*  He's like, I don't need the sugar and I don't need the coke. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2911.2799999999997s)]
*  He was drinking like 20 cokes a day or some ridiculous stuff. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2913.52s)]
*  And he just blew up and blew up and he could not stop until. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2916.4399999999996s)]
*  And this is why one of the reasons I think I think they know this. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2919.7599999999998s)]
*  I mean, the food industry knows they're making addictive food. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2922.24s)]
*  They clearly know that. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2925.2799999999997s)]
*  In fact, I had a gal who worked for one of the major food [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2926.3599999999997s)]
*  manufacturer and companies and her job, she was a chemist. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2929.12s)]
*  And her job was to design food to be as addictive as possible. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2932.68s)]
*  And she literally told me that she goes, I can no longer live with the guilt. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2936.4s)]
*  I want to come work for you guys. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2939.76s)]
*  You know, she was just so like just beside herself. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2941.6s)]
*  She says she realizes what she's created with this epidemic of disease and suffering. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2944.08s)]
*  I mean, because these people are suffering. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2948.56s)]
*  Did you see that movie The Whale? Did you ever see that movie? [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2950.04s)]
*  I did not. It's good. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2952.0s)]
*  It's an interesting movie. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2953.2s)]
*  So it's the Brandon Frazier and he's like 700 pound dude. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2954.08s)]
*  It shows he lives in his cow. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2957.2s)]
*  He lives in his recliner. He can't barely get up. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2958.8s)]
*  He can barely go to the bathroom refrigerator next to him. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2960.92s)]
*  And his whole life is in this guy. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2963.6800000000003s)]
*  The same thing he said he spent like he said he went. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2964.96s)]
*  He fasted one time for 40 days trying to lose weight. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2967.4s)]
*  Just and he never left his chair. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2969.7200000000003s)]
*  He just sat there for 40 days and didn't eat. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2971.16s)]
*  Can you imagine that's like hell? That's like hell on earth. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2973.6s)]
*  You know, but now he's like now he's going back to work. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2976.12s)]
*  He's getting out in the field and he's working, doing like electrical work [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2978.16s)]
*  or something like that. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2980.96s)]
*  But I mean, it's just the sugar in one way. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2982.2000000000003s)]
*  You know, I know there's people out there saying, listen, not sugar is fine. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2985.76s)]
*  It's all seed oils and stuff like that. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2988.04s)]
*  But I think clearly there are people that are addicted to either sugar [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2989.24s)]
*  or sugary foods. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2992.8399999999997s)]
*  You know, it's like, you know, because you like would you eat chocolate? [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2994.04s)]
*  There's no sugar in it. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2997.16s)]
*  I mean, it's like, you know, that 100 percent dark is kind of like, [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=2998.12s)]
*  you know, have you tried it? [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3001.3999999999996s)]
*  Have you kind of gross? It is. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3002.12s)]
*  It's like the only reason you eat that stuff because the sugar is in there. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3003.7599999999998s)]
*  So people say, well, no, no one's mainlining bags of sugar. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3005.72s)]
*  I mean, I actually I know people that have actually done that. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3008.3999999999996s)]
*  I mean, it's kind of crazy. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3010.24s)]
*  You see these people that are so addicted to this stuff, but they mainline. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3011.04s)]
*  Well, I mean, well, I mean, they just eat it out of the bag. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3014.52s)]
*  It's kind of like they're not shooting. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3017.36s)]
*  I mean, I'm not like heroin addicts, but I mean, they're they're like, [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3018.36s)]
*  you know, because there are there are people that say they'll do that [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3021.48s)]
*  if they can't get anything else. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3023.84s)]
*  And you just eat a bag of sugar. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3024.84s)]
*  They'll see they'll sit down. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3026.1200000000003s)]
*  Well, there's the lethal dose for sugar is about like five pounds. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3027.04s)]
*  If you like sat down, ate a five pound bag of sugar, it would kill you. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3031.36s)]
*  It would literally cause you going to liver failure. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3034.04s)]
*  So there is like an LD 50 on sugar. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3035.84s)]
*  So it is over what time period? [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3038.2000000000003s)]
*  Just like whatever, maybe a day or something like that. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3040.28s)]
*  You know, if you just sat down and ate, you know, and some of these people, [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3042.6800000000003s)]
*  you see some of these. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3045.2s)]
*  Have you seen like they call them fat [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3046.4399999999996s)]
*  influencers, like these body positive, I mean, you know, like influencers, [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3048.2799999999997s)]
*  but the fat, right. And they're and they're they're literally out there. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3051.6s)]
*  And the processed food companies actually pay these guys, right. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3054.04s)]
*  They do. Oh, yeah. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3056.68s)]
*  It's the same thing. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3057.6s)]
*  They're getting kickbacks to promote all this unhealthy behavior and unhealthy [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3058.52s)]
*  food. And they're going through what I eat in a day. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3061.9199999999996s)]
*  And it's like, you know, you know, everything, you know, it's like [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3064.04s)]
*  Doritos and cookies and Cokes and all the garbage that they're they're [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3067.48s)]
*  chowing down on. And, you know, we've got this whole the body positivity [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3070.9199999999996s)]
*  movement is being funded by the processed food industry. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3074.72s)]
*  I mean, if you didn't know that, I mean, it's like they're they've clearly [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3077.68s)]
*  shown directly, directly. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3080.08s)]
*  They're paying these people to do this. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3081.52s)]
*  The other thing processed food, they're paying dietitians on on social media [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3083.24s)]
*  also to recommend processed foods. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3087.52s)]
*  So it's just like it's it's I mean, it's it's clearly corrupt. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3090.04s)]
*  It's so dirty. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3094.0s)]
*  It's such a dirty, but it's like a war against your health. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3095.2799999999997s)]
*  And they're the enemy. They're the propagandists. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3098.56s)]
*  Well, and then they want to do. I mean, you've seen this stuff like, like, [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3100.64s)]
*  you know, they come off to you. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3102.76s)]
*  They say, oh, he's a racist or he's a right wing fascist or something like [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3103.5200000000004s)]
*  it because because you're like, I don't want to be sick and fat. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3106.6400000000003s)]
*  You know, that's what they come back and say. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3108.96s)]
*  It's it's you know, it's like there was some article like, you know, [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3110.88s)]
*  working out is a right wing conspiracy. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3114.32s)]
*  Do you see that? Yes. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3116.32s)]
*  It's like crazy wild. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3117.84s)]
*  Yeah, wild because some people will read that and people that are like [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3119.1200000000003s)]
*  extremely averse as to being labeled right wing or being labeled racist [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3122.5200000000004s)]
*  or xenophobic or whatever it is. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3126.96s)]
*  They're they're terrified of those labels. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3129.0400000000004s)]
*  They don't they don't want that smoke. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3131.0s)]
*  And so they see these things and it does affect the way they view the world [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3132.52s)]
*  as ridiculous as it sounds. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3136.04s)]
*  And maybe one article won't do it. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3138.28s)]
*  But if you see enough of them over time, you will associate [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3140.0s)]
*  that activity with some sort of problematic label that could be put on you, [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3144.28s)]
*  which is incredible that we're so easily influenced. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3149.7599999999998s)]
*  Some of us. Yeah, I mean, you know, I saw like I know you've had Elon [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3153.6s)]
*  on Elon Musk on several times. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3157.0s)]
*  I know he said like, look, I was a middle of the road dude. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3158.64s)]
*  And that's me, too. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3161.2s)]
*  I was like, I'm just kind of middle. Let people live. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3161.88s)]
*  I'm not political one way or the other. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3163.6400000000003s)]
*  And all of a sudden, the whole spectrum just shifts. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3165.48s)]
*  Yeah. Over and it's like if you're not promoting like craziness, [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3167.6400000000003s)]
*  you're all of a sudden this you're far right. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3171.6400000000003s)]
*  It's a racist, crazy person. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3173.6400000000003s)]
*  I've always been left wing, which is really crazy. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3175.36s)]
*  But the left moves so far away from what the left used to be. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3177.8s)]
*  Now you're now you're a fascist. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3181.76s)]
*  Now I'm an all right influencer. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3183.12s)]
*  Yeah, I've seen people label me as an alt right person. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3185.1600000000003s)]
*  I'm like, that is so wild that they can do that with a straight face. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3187.92s)]
*  Because I've always I've said, hey, maybe we should look in universal [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3192.2000000000003s)]
*  basic income, maybe we should use and look into universal health care. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3195.48s)]
*  I think education should be free. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3198.6400000000003s)]
*  You know, I think we should subsidize the schools and we should fix the roads. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3200.52s)]
*  We should fucking fix inner cities. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3203.92s)]
*  And we should if you're going to use tax dollars, that's that. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3205.4s)]
*  And if I thought my tax dollars were being used very appropriately in that way, [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3208.28s)]
*  I'd be 100 percent in favor of all that stuff. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3213.36s)]
*  If I thought it really was an overall benefit to society. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3215.84s)]
*  The problem is bureaucracy and big government is insanely inefficient. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3219.88s)]
*  Like if you were talking about if there was some sort of [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3225.0s)]
*  private industry and the private industry only profited if something was successful [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3230.92s)]
*  and they got involved in these particular activities, if they got involved [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3236.44s)]
*  in education, if they got involved in dietary health and the only way [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3240.88s)]
*  they were profitable is if their methods were effective because there's a free market. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3244.2400000000002s)]
*  That would probably work. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3249.56s)]
*  But when you get the government involved, all it does is make the government [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3250.8s)]
*  employees more wealthy. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3254.6400000000003s)]
*  It makes the government larger and it makes them protect that industry. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3256.7200000000003s)]
*  We covered that with the homeless thing in California. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3260.52s)]
*  If you're not aware, there's people that are working on the homeless. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3264.08s)]
*  There's like a shitload of them. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3267.4s)]
*  And some of them, they're making a quarter million dollars a year [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3269.6s)]
*  and they are not putting a fucking dent in it. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3272.44s)]
*  They're not effective at all. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3275.88s)]
*  In fact, the only thing that I saw that was effective at all [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3277.8s)]
*  in stopping the tents and the homeless situation was when G.J. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3280.8s)]
*  Ping in San Francisco, they fucking cleaned it up like that. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3284.0s)]
*  Like you could have done this the whole time. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3288.0400000000004s)]
*  What do they do to those people? Where do they put those people? [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3289.76s)]
*  I don't know. But what are they going to do now? [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3291.76s)]
*  Now that G.J. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3294.2000000000003s)]
*  Ping is gone, are they going to like take down the fences and let people camp again? [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3294.96s)]
*  Like you showed that the overall quality of life of the people [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3298.88s)]
*  that live in that city is not important to you. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3302.76s)]
*  What's important is the view, the optics. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3304.48s)]
*  When a fucking dictator comes and visits, which is so wild. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3307.56s)]
*  Yeah, I saw, you know, the governor Gavin Newsom, I guess. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3313.6s)]
*  Do you think he's I think he's going to run for I think I'm just one. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3315.88s)]
*  You know, I try not to get political, but I'm just like, [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3318.4s)]
*  what's going to happen in the next election? [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3321.6s)]
*  I mean, is Biden even going to be able to run? [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3323.04s)]
*  I think at this point, they kind of have to run him unless he dies. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3325.2000000000003s)]
*  I don't we don't have we have one year now. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3331.48s)]
*  We're in November. We're in late November. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3334.12s)]
*  We have less than a year. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3336.32s)]
*  Like what it how what are they going to do? [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3337.96s)]
*  I mean, you could look if Biden died tomorrow. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3340.1600000000003s)]
*  And then what do they do with Kamala Harris? [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3343.84s)]
*  They're going to put her on the moon. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3346.8s)]
*  Like, what are they going to do? [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3347.96s)]
*  She's the vice president. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3348.96s)]
*  So if he dies, she becomes the president, which is fucking wild. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3350.1600000000003s)]
*  When you hear that lady talk. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3354.52s)]
*  Well, what if what if what if like Biden says like in, I don't know, may says, [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3355.6800000000003s)]
*  you know, I'm I'm just not feeling up to it. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3360.48s)]
*  And then and then they say Kamala is now the president. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3362.2400000000002s)]
*  She's the first female president. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3364.2000000000003s)]
*  And then she steps down at the convention and they said, [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3365.84s)]
*  well, let's give it to Newsom. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3368.6400000000003s)]
*  I mean, that's a plausible scenario is possible. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3370.0s)]
*  But it would be a real problem for people that are Kamala Harris supporters. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3372.48s)]
*  And believe it or not, they exist. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3375.48s)]
*  Yeah. But I mean, how I mean, I'm sure that I'm sure the Democratic Party [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3377.52s)]
*  is just like calculating how they have to be. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3380.1600000000003s)]
*  How big is this? And what's what's the thing? [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3382.04s)]
*  I think they have fucking no cards. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3383.8s)]
*  And they're looking at this this game. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3386.6400000000003s)]
*  And I don't know. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3388.6000000000004s)]
*  I think they're depending upon party loyalty [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3389.4s)]
*  and they're depending upon Trump getting convicted and arrested. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3392.32s)]
*  I mean, and imprisoned rather. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3395.88s)]
*  I don't know if that's going to happen. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3398.68s)]
*  I don't think it is. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3400.16s)]
*  It doesn't seem to. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3401.16s)]
*  It seems like it's a bunch of trumped up charges. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3402.08s)]
*  No pun intended. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3404.12s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I just again, I'm not a political commenter, not expert. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3405.4s)]
*  It does seem like really like why are they going after him so hard right now [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3409.96s)]
*  when they could have done it, you know, like the whatever the hotel thing [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3414.48s)]
*  or the valuation of the property from 20 years ago? [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3417.68s)]
*  It's bananas. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3420.36s)]
*  The valuation of the property is so obvious, so off what it should be. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3421.44s)]
*  Eighteen million dollars for Marla Lager. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3426.84s)]
*  I'd fucking buy it. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3428.6400000000003s)]
*  I'd fucking buy it immediately. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3430.0s)]
*  That shit was 18 million dollars, and you were the only one [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3431.4s)]
*  that was able to buy it. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3433.52s)]
*  You'd be a fool not to scoop it up because you could sell it right away. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3435.04s)]
*  You get a loan and you sell that bitch right away for who knows how much. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3438.32s)]
*  I mean, I think Forbes valued it. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3441.6800000000003s)]
*  I think it was like well over seven hundred million. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3444.04s)]
*  And Trump thinks it's worth over a billion. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3447.32s)]
*  And he might be right. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3449.48s)]
*  That's what's crazy. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3450.76s)]
*  It's a giant piece of property and one of the most valuable [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3451.84s)]
*  pieces of land in all of America. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3455.0s)]
*  I mean, a house next to him down the street, a much smaller place, sold for 50. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3458.4s)]
*  Yeah, so it doesn't make sense. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3462.28s)]
*  It doesn't make it. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3463.48s)]
*  It doesn't make sense if you if you want to look at banana public republic. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3464.6000000000004s)]
*  I mean, when you're imprisoning and trying to convict your political opponents, [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3469.4s)]
*  which is the problem with that is even if you think Donald Trump is a crook, [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3473.7200000000003s)]
*  even if you think that he should be arrested, [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3477.6000000000004s)]
*  this sets a precedent for future presidents. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3479.88s)]
*  If we get someone who is not just Donald Trump, [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3483.6400000000003s)]
*  who has a lot of people in the center that say, hey, his economic policies [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3487.0s)]
*  were effective, his foreign policies were effective, even if I think he's a jerk. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3490.04s)]
*  Maybe that would be better to have a jerk run the country in a way [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3493.7200000000003s)]
*  that's better overall than what's being done right now. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3497.12s)]
*  Even if you looked at that, what if someone further right than him steps in? [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3500.2000000000003s)]
*  What if a war breaks out? [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3504.4s)]
*  What if things get even crazier? [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3505.7200000000003s)]
*  What if nationalism really upticks? [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3507.08s)]
*  Then you have someone who is now in power that is far right. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3509.96s)]
*  Like has happened all over the world. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3514.28s)]
*  If that happens and that person, if that precedent has been set [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3517.08s)]
*  for prosecuting your political opponents and going after them with trumped up [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3520.88s)]
*  charges, we have a horrible situation. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3524.88s)]
*  And that's one of the reasons why we have to stick with the rule of law. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3527.6400000000003s)]
*  We have to stick with the way this country was founded on. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3531.08s)]
*  These principles were set up because they wanted to mitigate corruption [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3534.2400000000002s)]
*  at its base level at every step of the way. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3538.4s)]
*  They wanted to stretch it out so no one could be an authoritarian dictator [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3540.84s)]
*  and run America. Yeah, because you talk about the backlash, [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3545.6800000000003s)]
*  because you saw like recently in Argentina, you know, there's a libertarian one. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3548.2400000000002s)]
*  And then just in the Netherlands, which is kind of interesting [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3552.2400000000002s)]
*  because they were like in the Netherlands, they're trying to get rid of cows. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3554.48s)]
*  They're like, oh, these cows are farting. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3557.1600000000003s)]
*  They're killing the atmosphere. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3558.52s)]
*  And the farmers were like, we don't like this. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3559.6800000000003s)]
*  And so they had this, I guess, is PPP or PPV party freedom party. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3561.44s)]
*  And they won that by a landslide. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3565.7200000000003s)]
*  And so when he saw in Italy, Maloney takes over. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3567.68s)]
*  So you've got this, I think, backlash coming back. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3570.3599999999997s)]
*  It depends on how far does it pendulum swing back the other way. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3573.48s)]
*  And you kind of like, I don't know. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3576.08s)]
*  I mean, day to day to me, it doesn't really affect me that much [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3577.8399999999997s)]
*  because I'm not like a political crazy person. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3580.12s)]
*  But I'm just like, how does it affect my day to day stuff? [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3582.48s)]
*  I mean, a little bit of the covid stuff, I was a little annoyed by that. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3584.48s)]
*  I don't know. I know. I was very annoyed. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3587.08s)]
*  I don't know. You know, I was I just spoke in a conference in Florida [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3588.7999999999997s)]
*  and I had Robert Malone sitting next to me in the car when he was going out there. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3591.64s)]
*  I just kind of saw some of the craziness there. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3594.8399999999997s)]
*  And I know that's a that's a really sensitive issue. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3596.76s)]
*  But it's sensitive, but it shouldn't be. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3599.6800000000003s)]
*  It should be sensitive the other way. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3602.6400000000003s)]
*  You should. Everyone at this point in time should realize that we got hoodwinked. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3604.2000000000003s)]
*  Everyone should realize that it was an overall net negative for children [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3608.1200000000003s)]
*  that got kept out of schools, masks, all the shit that we saw that went on. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3612.44s)]
*  Forget about just the vaccines, the lockdowns, just what they did, [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3617.32s)]
*  the closing of businesses, the essential businesses [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3621.48s)]
*  that they had big chains labeled as essential. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3625.24s)]
*  But these small mom and pop stores were forced to go under. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3629.0s)]
*  People had worked their whole lives to develop these businesses [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3632.8s)]
*  and they took them away from them. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3636.96s)]
*  And it's fucked up. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3638.52s)]
*  And the fact that no one is outraged still and that this narrative has been allowed [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3639.96s)]
*  to be portrayed through the mass media, that this isn't a major problem [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3644.24s)]
*  and that this cannot happen again. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3649.36s)]
*  Like this is fucking madness, man. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3651.24s)]
*  Yeah, it's like you said, sure. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3653.84s)]
*  I'm wearing here. This is from my jujitsu coach. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3655.1200000000003s)]
*  This guy's Greg Anderson. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3656.88s)]
*  He was he was a I know that dude. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3658.04s)]
*  But you know, I followed him on Instagram. He's a good guy. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3659.6800000000003s)]
*  So he special forces or special operations rather. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3661.56s)]
*  Army Ranger 15 1415 tours overseas comes back as a Seattle cop. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3665.2000000000003s)]
*  And during the pandemic and they are like, hey, you need to go arrest this lady [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3670.2000000000003s)]
*  for doing people's nails at her home. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3674.1200000000003s)]
*  And he's like, I'm not doing that. This is total bullshit. Right. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3676.1200000000003s)]
*  And he made a video and it went viral. Yeah. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3678.8s)]
*  And the cops, the Seattle police commissioner said, hey, Greg, [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3682.04s)]
*  we agree in principle what you're saying, but you got to take down a video. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3685.56s)]
*  Like we and he just said, no, fuck you. I'm not going to do it. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3688.8399999999997s)]
*  So they fired him. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3691.44s)]
*  And so he got like like a GoFundMe page and he raised much money. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3692.72s)]
*  And he opened a jujitsu studio and a crossfit gym. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3695.96s)]
*  He's like, I make more money now as a jujitsu guy that I ever did as a as a cop. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3697.7999999999997s)]
*  So he's great online, too. He's very wise. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3702.56s)]
*  He's a guy and he always beats my ass whenever I roll against him. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3704.8399999999997s)]
*  He always are. That motherfucker, man. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3707.3199999999997s)]
*  This is like I try one time, one round, I got to like within two seconds [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3710.16s)]
*  of a round and he hit and got me and he got me in the last second. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3713.9199999999996s)]
*  So it's kind of like, well, that's the process. Yeah, exactly. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3716.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean, one day you'll be doing that to people. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3720.48s)]
*  Yeah, stay healthy. Hopefully. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3722.3599999999997s)]
*  And that's what the stem cells are for. Yeah, exactly. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3723.52s)]
*  Well, I appreciate that. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3725.3599999999997s)]
*  That was I guess we've been talking about that. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3726.3599999999997s)]
*  So you've been doing stem cells for for a while, right? [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3727.8799999999997s)]
*  Oh, I've cured some really serious injuries with stem cells. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3730.6s)]
*  Yeah. That I was told needed surgery. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3734.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's that's interesting because I'm an orthopedic surgeon. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3736.56s)]
*  I operate on I replace knees and hips and shoulders and all that stuff over the years. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3739.16s)]
*  And the orthopedic surgery orthopedic academy says stem cells don't really work. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3743.28s)]
*  And so but the question is, is it because again, there's a conflict of interest [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3749.12s)]
*  there, because if you're not getting surgery because you're getting stem cells, [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3753.08s)]
*  I'm losing out on, you know, shoulder arthroscopy money. Right. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3756.36s)]
*  So I mean, there's a little bit of conflict of interest there. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3759.16s)]
*  So I go in it with a little bit of skepticism, but I'm open minded. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3761.56s)]
*  And we'll see. Like I said, if I, you know, if I notice, [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3764.84s)]
*  because I want to get back to rolling. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3766.92s)]
*  The key is you have to not roll for quite a while. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3768.24s)]
*  Yeah. You have to really let that thing heal. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3770.6s)]
*  Well, what I'm planning on, you know, like I said, I like I got one of those iron neck deals. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3772.52s)]
*  You're a fan of that. I talked to the guy Robert, I think, is the [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3776.4799999999996s)]
*  head of that company. And it's pretty cool. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3780.64s)]
*  I was doing it in the hotel room this morning. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3782.56s)]
*  But I mean, it was just like I want to because I got a long neck. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3784.24s)]
*  I don't know if you can tell I got a pretty long neck. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3787.72s)]
*  I'm pretty big, strong guy. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3789.08s)]
*  But my neck is an area where I didn't really like [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3790.2s)]
*  spend a lot of time developing because I mean, when I played rugby, I did. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3792.72s)]
*  I do some neck bridges and wrestlers bridges and like you neck bridge and start bench [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3796.16s)]
*  pressing with the weight on there. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3799.7599999999998s)]
*  But I hadn't done it in years, you know, because I just like that. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3801.12s)]
*  So then, you know, when I got into Jiu Jitsu and I've been doing, you know, two [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3803.56s)]
*  years into it, basically, then I just got dumped, man. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3807.2799999999997s)]
*  I was just like, you know, we're talking about that. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3809.64s)]
*  It's got landed on my head, dropped on my head and flex under me in my way. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3811.6s)]
*  Because I'm about 250, 260. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3815.2799999999997s)]
*  And the other guy was like, I don't know, 220. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3817.44s)]
*  And it's just like that combined weight. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3819.3199999999997s)]
*  It was just like it's a lot of weight. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3820.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. So it's one thing. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3822.48s)]
*  So I want to. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3823.44s)]
*  Next are a real problem. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3823.68s)]
*  John John Machado always said, never trust your neck. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3824.96s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. So that's his. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3827.36s)]
*  So my goal is to make it as strong and as flexible and as bulletproof as possible [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3829.08s)]
*  for I go back, you know, because I may go back to just doing some like drilling [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3833.2s)]
*  and stuff like that, but not the actual live rounds for a while. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3836.52s)]
*  But yeah, you just have to avoid aggravating it while it happens. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3838.96s)]
*  My buddy Shane Dorian, who's a big wave surfer, he just went down to the CPI [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3843.2400000000002s)]
*  in Tijuana and they could do some wild shit down there. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3848.8s)]
*  And then they inject because that's part of the problem with it [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3852.04s)]
*  not being completely approved by the FDA is they're limited in their applications. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3855.0s)]
*  So but in Mexico, they're not. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3859.44s)]
*  And so they've had tremendous results and they inject directly into the discs. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3861.36s)]
*  They put you under under anesthesia. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3866.76s)]
*  They inject you directly into the discs. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3868.8s)]
*  And they told them, don't I want you to do anything for eight weeks. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3871.08s)]
*  Nothing. Yeah. You're walking. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3874.12s)]
*  That's it. No, no, nothing straining. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3875.96s)]
*  That's hard to do. It's hard to do. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3878.24s)]
*  But it's it's important. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3879.72s)]
*  It's so hard for guys like you and I that work out all the time, but it's so important. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3881.52s)]
*  And one of the things that I realized, I was getting a lot of stem cells [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3886.0s)]
*  in my left knee in particular. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3890.28s)]
*  I had a torn MCL and I just wasn't letting it heal properly. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3891.64s)]
*  I would I would get the stem cells and then four weeks later, I'd go back to Muay Thai [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3896.0s)]
*  and I'd be smashing the bag and kicking the pads. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3899.6s)]
*  Then my knee would swell up again. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3901.68s)]
*  I was like, fuck. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3903.0s)]
*  And I was thinking, God damn it, I don't want to get surgery. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3904.16s)]
*  And then I would go back again, get more stem cells, do it again. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3906.0s)]
*  Then I finally got the stem cells and I said, OK, I am going to take a year off of kicking. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3909.2400000000002s)]
*  And I didn't do any kicking at all for a year. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3914.8s)]
*  Now it's back to full strength. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3918.44s)]
*  I have no problems with it. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3921.0s)]
*  I'm slamming the bag. No problems. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3922.08s)]
*  It doesn't hurt. It's still missing meniscus in there because I had it scoped in 2003, [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3923.88s)]
*  I believe it was. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3930.1600000000003s)]
*  And so there's a chunk of I had a bucket handle tear. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3931.36s)]
*  It was a real problem. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3933.52s)]
*  It was a nasty meniscus tear that I had. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3934.44s)]
*  So they remove some meniscus, which can contribute to arthritis if you're not careful. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3937.16s)]
*  But it just gets a little sore sometimes. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3940.88s)]
*  But the structure is not it's not a problem at all anymore. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3944.72s)]
*  And I did a lot of that knees over toes stuff. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3948.68s)]
*  You know, that guy, that guy's amazing. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3951.72s)]
*  He's amazing. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3954.0s)]
*  And I love that he puts all that information out there for everybody. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3955.36s)]
*  He just lets you know for free. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3959.3199999999997s)]
*  He shows his mom doing it. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3960.64s)]
*  He shows how he had all these knee surgeries and all these problems. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3962.56s)]
*  And now he can dunk. He can run, sprint, do all these different things. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3965.88s)]
*  So I started incorporating all those knees over toes things, the Nordic curls, the tip bar raises. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3969.28s)]
*  My knees are significantly stronger than they've been in years. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3975.8s)]
*  Yeah, I do some of the backwards stuff that he does. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3980.04s)]
*  I've got to I've got to hill up my house is about 80 meter. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3982.1600000000003s)]
*  You still do hill sprints, Joe? You still do that? [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3984.4s)]
*  No, I haven't done those, but I do a lot of sled work. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3986.28s)]
*  Yeah, I do a lot of pushing the sled and I still run a little bit. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3989.44s)]
*  I do I have one of those treadmills that are self propelled. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3994.32s)]
*  Yeah, like an arc one. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=3999.56s)]
*  Yes, those are great. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4000.32s)]
*  Those are great. I've got one. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4001.6400000000003s)]
*  I've got one in the garage because you're on the ball of your foot. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4002.6800000000003s)]
*  It's you know, it's fairly cushioned and that doesn't irritate me at all. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4005.1200000000003s)]
*  It's supposed to sort of, I guess, provide better feedback for better, correct running technique. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4009.08s)]
*  Yeah, it's like the salt air runner is one I've got. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4013.88s)]
*  And it's yeah, I think that's what I have to. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4016.56s)]
*  And it's supposedly like I think it's 13 percent more difficult than running regularly. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4018.56s)]
*  I've heard it's a little harder. Yeah. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4023.44s)]
*  So it's nice. It gives you real good cardiovascular benefits and doesn't hurt my knees. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4024.6400000000003s)]
*  And it doesn't fuck with you. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4029.2000000000003s)]
*  Do you run do you run sprints or do you what do you kind of run? [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4030.0400000000004s)]
*  I mostly just do distance. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4032.0400000000004s)]
*  You know, I'll do like, you know, time and keep my my heart rate at, you know, in the high 140s, something like that. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4033.5600000000004s)]
*  What percentage of like when you say because you do what percentage of your training is Jiu Jitsu versus striking or grappling versus striking? [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4040.44s)]
*  And I haven't been doing much grappling lately. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4048.0s)]
*  So I've been doing more striking than that. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4050.16s)]
*  But it was mostly because of my knee, because I just wanted to give it time off. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4052.44s)]
*  And now that it's better. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4056.7599999999998s)]
*  And then I was going through El Conti season and El Conti season. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4058.56s)]
*  I didn't want to fuck anything up because, you know, when you El Conti, you have to, you know, you're doing 10, 12 miles a day and you're doing it in the mountains. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4061.2s)]
*  So most of my work was I was doing rocking. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4069.7599999999998s)]
*  I was doing a lot of farmers carries. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4073.6s)]
*  I was doing elevated treadmill with weight on my back. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4075.44s)]
*  I was doing a lot of things like that that is just design stair master. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4078.7599999999998s)]
*  Doing all the different knees over toes stuff, box steps, all these different things just specifically to condition my legs for the mountains. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4083.24s)]
*  And I didn't want to fuck my knees up. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4091.0s)]
*  But that's over. So now I can go back to Jiu Jitsu. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4092.44s)]
*  Got it. Got it. Yeah. I was just wondering, like, you know, because you because you got a black belt. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4094.36s)]
*  You've been doing it for what? [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4097.6s)]
*  30 years or so. Forever. Forever. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4098.96s)]
*  Yes. You kind of like you figure out like I'm still in a learning phase. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4100.56s)]
*  I'm like the biggest problem for me is like, I can't get in enough as I want to hit that learning curve. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4103.6s)]
*  And so the big thing is drilling. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4108.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. Drilling is everything. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4110.6s)]
*  And everybody loves to roll because it's so exactly. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4112.4400000000005s)]
*  It's so fun. But really drilling and live drills, you know, like, you know, you and especially if you get good training partners, good training partners or everything, someone who gives you like 50 percent, 60 percent resistance. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4115.080000000001s)]
*  And then you go through a pass phase, you know, you go through a guard pass phase or you go through a back mount, you know, whatever your routine is that you do just fucking do that over and over and over and over again. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4127.88s)]
*  I made my biggest leaps when I was a blue belt because good friends with Eddie Bravo and he and I would drill twice a week. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4139.400000000001s)]
*  We would just get together and nothing but drill, nothing but drill. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4147.76s)]
*  And it made massive leaps in my improvement because I was conditioned to hit those. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4151.92s)]
*  My my my body knew what it just like time. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4157.04s)]
*  He would describe it like tying your shoelace. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4160.76s)]
*  You don't even think about tying your shoelace, right? [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4163.12s)]
*  You get it once you know how to do it near you just it just does that. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4164.88s)]
*  You want that with your jujitsu techniques and the way to get that with your jujitsu techniques is to drill, just drill over and over and over again. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4168.56s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. This on white belts. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4176.76s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4178.08s)]
*  Because I find like, you know, because I'm still a white belt. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4179.88s)]
*  I mean, because I just I didn't I don't go as much. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4182.48s)]
*  But I mean, it's just like when I go to the white belt, it's like it's like war. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4184.32s)]
*  Man, it's just like, yeah, right, right, right. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4187.88s)]
*  So you got to learn how to be playful. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4190.8s)]
*  That's what the Gracie's always say. Keep it playful. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4192.24s)]
*  I try to play like I have my better roles with the with the higher belts, like the black belts, because I mean, because they know like they can dial it back in there. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4194.44s)]
*  It's just kind of like they kind of let you work a little bit. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4201.44s)]
*  So that's really and I always but I always try to get the harder ones because I'm like, you know, I'm like a big guy and I like, you know, that's a problem, too, is that you're so big. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4203.44s)]
*  Yeah. You know, when big guys, it's hard for them to learn. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4210.719999999999s)]
*  That's like a big guy that has a guard is so fucking dangerous. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4214.36s)]
*  That's why Fabrizio Verdoom was so dangerous because he was a heavyweight, a giant guy who had a lethal guard because it's so rare because big guys can just get on top. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4218.12s)]
*  They get on top and smash the smaller people. And that's fun. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4228.08s)]
*  And so they do that more often than not. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4230.92s)]
*  And it's very rare that you get a big guy that has really sharp, sharp technique. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4233.2s)]
*  Most people say the best jujitsu to learn is learn jujitsu from a smaller person. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4238.72s)]
*  You learn jujitsu from, you know, like one of the Mendez brothers or Hoyler Gracie or someone who's a smaller person physically, Marcelo Garcia. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4243.76s)]
*  So their technique is just sharp. Has to be. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4252.24s)]
*  Has to be. There's no options. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4255.0s)]
*  You can't muscle your way around things. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4257.4800000000005s)]
*  How many times have you been caught in an arm bar? You can just fucking yank your arm out. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4259.76s)]
*  Yeah, if it's a white belt putting on, I usually get out. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4262.8s)]
*  Usually I like it because then I'm like, I'm going to get out and land on you. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4265.64s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4268.16s)]
*  But if it's somebody good like Greg, I'm fine. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4269.16s)]
*  There was a period where I was kind of figuring out, I was like pushing his lower leg down and catching it between my legs. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4272.12s)]
*  And I was doing that for a while and I was kind of defeating him a little bit. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4276.56s)]
*  Then he of course figured that out and still arm barred me anyway. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4279.4800000000005s)]
*  That's what being a black belt's all about. How much does he weigh? [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4283.08s)]
*  Greg's 200-ish, something like that. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4286.32s)]
*  So that's decent size. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4288.44s)]
*  It's decent size, but you have a significant advantage over him weight-wise. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4289.96s)]
*  I'm like 260. It's right now. Usually I'm about 250. I'm a little fat right now. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4293.24s)]
*  You kind of learn how to not use that. It's so counterintuitive. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4296.88s)]
*  Well, what he says is use it when you need it. I mean, there's times when strength is important. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4301.4s)]
*  And you don't want to... It's like telling a fast guy, don't be fast. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4305.4s)]
*  I mean, it's like you want to use what you have to some degree. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4308.12s)]
*  But that's in competition. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4311.04s)]
*  What learning and training is supposed to be about [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4312.32s)]
*  is drilling those techniques into your central nervous system, [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4316.12s)]
*  drilling those techniques into your mind and your body [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4319.04s)]
*  so that when the opportunity arises, like when you hit an arm drag, [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4321.599999999999s)]
*  your body immediately knows what to do. It's just instantaneous. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4326.12s)]
*  It's not like, oh, OK, I got the elbow and I pull. Now what? [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4330.92s)]
*  It's just... [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4335.4s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that makes total sense because it's like, you know, like, [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4336.599999999999s)]
*  it's kind of funny before I hurt my neck, I got all these Danahair videos. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4340.32s)]
*  I'm like watching them like, oh, yeah, because John is like, he's funny. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4342.96s)]
*  I mean, it's just like you listen to talking on his videos and he'll just say something off the wall. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4345.679999999999s)]
*  It's like, oh, yes, like when you're at the if you're hanging out at the strip joint last night, [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4349.719999999999s)]
*  I'm like, what? You know, he throws these funny things in there. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4352.88s)]
*  And he's such a good explainer. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4355.5199999999995s)]
*  He's such a good guy describing what you're supposed to be doing, [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4356.679999999999s)]
*  what you're supposed to be thinking, why you're doing it. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4360.32s)]
*  And I enjoy that. But but again, then you go to a live role and you're like, wait a minute. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4362.24s)]
*  It's to happen. It's changing too fast for me to keep up. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4366.48s)]
*  You can't picture that. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4368.72s)]
*  That's why drilling is so important. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4369.8s)]
*  Drilling is everything. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4371.4400000000005s)]
*  When you meet guys that drill versus guys that don't drill. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4372.68s)]
*  Another is a giant leap in their improvement. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4376.52s)]
*  The guys who drill another thing that really helps is teaching. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4378.92s)]
*  When my friends who realize that they really love Jiu-Jitsu [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4383.56s)]
*  and they started teaching lower belts to make a living, they didn't want to do their job anymore. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4388.04s)]
*  So they got a job teaching private lessons. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4392.280000000001s)]
*  Those guys got so much better. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4395.0s)]
*  It's really incredible. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4397.679999999999s)]
*  It's extraordinary, the leap that they make, because they're concentrating on the basics [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4399.04s)]
*  and they're explaining it to me, to people. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4403.5599999999995s)]
*  So when they're explaining these things to people, it's like cementing it in their mind, [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4407.28s)]
*  like really carving those grooves deeply in their mind, in their body. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4412.0s)]
*  So their body knows exactly what to do in those situations. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4416.84s)]
*  Yeah, we used to have a saying in surgery, see one, do one, teach one. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4419.679999999999s)]
*  I mean, it wasn't exactly that. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4422.84s)]
*  But I mean, if you could teach it, then you really had it down. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4424.28s)]
*  100%. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4426.76s)]
*  That's when I got really good at martial arts, when I was teaching. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4427.92s)]
*  When I was a kid, I started teaching very early on. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4430.56s)]
*  My instructor realized that I had some potential. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4433.56s)]
*  So he told me at a very young age, I think I was like 16 when I started teaching, [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4435.76s)]
*  he said, look, we need someone to teach white belts. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4440.96s)]
*  You're good and you're very dedicated. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4444.4800000000005s)]
*  If you teach, you can train here for free. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4447.0s)]
*  So I was great. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4449.12s)]
*  I was like, this is awesome. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4450.200000000001s)]
*  Now I don't have to pay dues. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4451.200000000001s)]
*  All I have to do is show up and teach, which I love to do anyway. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4452.240000000001s)]
*  And it helped me. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4454.72s)]
*  It made a big I got big leaps in my improvement from teaching. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4455.92s)]
*  Yeah, it makes sense. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4460.28s)]
*  You know, you know what really shocked me is because, you know, [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4461.12s)]
*  doing this carnivore stuff, a lot of people are reaching out to me. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4463.68s)]
*  And I had the first time I met a professional MMA guy. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4465.84s)]
*  His name was George, George Carcan. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4469.68s)]
*  And he thought it bellator. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4471.2s)]
*  And yeah, very good fighter. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4472.4s)]
*  And he goes, hey, would you mind if I came to your house and train? [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4473.4800000000005s)]
*  I said, yeah, sure. Come on over. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4476.4s)]
*  And he's such an I was like, this is a killer. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4477.4800000000005s)]
*  These guys are assassins. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4479.56s)]
*  I mean, their job is literally to beat people up. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4480.76s)]
*  Right. The nicest people I've ever met. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4482.6s)]
*  I've been I've been amazed at how just super nice all these guys are. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4484.88s)]
*  I've met a lot of them now. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4488.4800000000005s)]
*  And it's just like, well, I'll prove. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4489.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, it's just like that's that's the one thing. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4490.76s)]
*  One of the reasons I like about Jiu Jitsu is like it puts the rest of your life [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4493.16s)]
*  in perspective. You know, you go there and literally like someone's [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4497.2s)]
*  literally like trying to kill you. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4500.36s)]
*  Trying to choke you to death. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4501.52s)]
*  You'd be dead if they like continue. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4502.72s)]
*  You literally die. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4504.28s)]
*  And so you're like you're fighting for your life. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4505.64s)]
*  And then the rest of life is like, well, at least I'm not getting [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4508.08s)]
*  fighting so much easier. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4510.68s)]
*  It's what's the hardest thing you do is always the hardest thing you do. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4512.16s)]
*  Yeah. If the hardest thing you do is parallel parking. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4515.68s)]
*  Like, I can't do it. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4517.8s)]
*  You know, it becomes a fucking a real issue. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4518.88s)]
*  But if you're used to Jiu Jitsu, the rest of the life is easy. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4521.36s)]
*  Right. You know, you just try not to get your arm broken. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4525.2s)]
*  You try to like literally. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4527.88s)]
*  I mean, how many people are running around all day [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4530.599999999999s)]
*  where multiple times a day you're trying not to get your arm broken? [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4533.12s)]
*  Right. Yeah. It's pretty rare. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4536.16s)]
*  But in Jiu Jitsu, it's insanely common. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4538.08s)]
*  Yes, like like 10 times a half an hour. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4540.32s)]
*  So it's also it's such an insane stress reliever. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4542.5199999999995s)]
*  And it's a moving form of meditation because it's so engrossing [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4545.84s)]
*  and it's so all encompassing. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4549.96s)]
*  You're all your thoughts are on that movement at that time. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4551.96s)]
*  If you're training, you're rolling. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4555.759999999999s)]
*  All your thoughts are completely locked in. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4557.24s)]
*  You're not thinking, fuck my electric bill. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4559.92s)]
*  I forgot to pay it. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4561.599999999999s)]
*  Oh, my God, I got to do this. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4562.719999999999s)]
*  And what about the end of the month? [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4564.32s)]
*  I owe taxes. You're not thinking of any of that. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4565.759999999999s)]
*  If you're thinking any of that stuff, you're quickly going to be choked. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4567.88s)]
*  Yes, it's just like, you know, it's kind of funny because this is trying to explain that. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4570.2s)]
*  Just like my you know, my my spouse is like she sees me coming in. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4573.36s)]
*  My face is all scratched up. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4576.8s)]
*  I got black eyes. She's like, why the fuck? [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4578.44s)]
*  Doesn't she? It doesn't compute her. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4581.24s)]
*  But I'm like, it's so fun. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4582.88s)]
*  It's just like it's so there's such a positive trade off for that. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4584.8s)]
*  And you only like the like I said, I'm just thinking about for like, [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4588.76s)]
*  you know, think about longevity and stuff like that. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4591.0s)]
*  And it's like, yeah, if I get hurt, then I can't train. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4593.08s)]
*  And then that's going to have a negative impact on me. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4595.44s)]
*  So it's kind of balancing that out so that you can still continue [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4596.84s)]
*  to do the things that keep you healthy and still enjoy this thing. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4599.84s)]
*  Is training smart, finding good training partners like if you train with Greg, [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4603.2s)]
*  I guarantee you it's safer than training with someone who's like a brute of a blue. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4607.28s)]
*  He's never hurt me. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4612.400000000001s)]
*  You know, he's never hurt me, but he's he's submitted me like a gazillion times. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4613.400000000001s)]
*  And it's like, again, that's what being a black belt's all about. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4617.52s)]
*  But if you can just find training partners like that and then also drill, [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4620.64s)]
*  you'll be able to train. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4625.96s)]
*  I mean, Elio Gracie was training well into his 80s. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4627.32s)]
*  Yeah, you know. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4631.08s)]
*  But but if you watch him train, he was training with his sons and they were just [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4631.799999999999s)]
*  they were flow rolling, you know, so he's always going over the techniques. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4635.679999999999s)]
*  But there's no spiking them on his head. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4639.48s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? It's like that. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4642.04s)]
*  The problem is the actual chaos of rolling [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4643.799999999999s)]
*  where knees get yanked and, you know, fucking backs get fucked up. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4647.92s)]
*  That's where the problem lies. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4652.28s)]
*  But if you can train smart and train with other people [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4653.719999999999s)]
*  that are also dedicated to training smart, you can continue your improvement. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4656.68s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I look forward to getting back. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4660.320000000001s)]
*  I'm thinking probably with this neck thing, probably, you know, [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4661.96s)]
*  you know, three, four months down the road. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4666.64s)]
*  It's so addictive. Yeah. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4668.0s)]
*  I remember I was like, [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4669.400000000001s)]
*  I guess I was probably like twenty seven or twenty eight [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4672.0s)]
*  the first time I got hurt. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4674.04s)]
*  And I went to a doctor and the doctor was like, well, you got to stop doing Jiu Jitsu. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4675.12s)]
*  I was like, OK, fix this. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4678.84s)]
*  And I'm getting right back in there. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4681.200000000001s)]
*  I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4682.72s)]
*  Like all I was thinking is like, how long do I have to recover from surgery [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4684.32s)]
*  before I can get back to rolling again? [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4687.599999999999s)]
*  That's all I was thinking. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4689.2s)]
*  I was not thinking like, oh, I have to stop now. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4690.5199999999995s)]
*  I was like, what? He was saying stop. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4693.08s)]
*  I was like, stop what? [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4694.88s)]
*  Stop the one thing that keeps me sane. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4696.599999999999s)]
*  Like, because, you know, especially if you're a person [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4699.24s)]
*  that deals with other high pressure things, [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4702.4s)]
*  it makes those other high pressure things so much easier. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4704.88s)]
*  Yeah, it really does. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4707.719999999999s)]
*  And it elevates your human potential. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4709.12s)]
*  Like whatever you do in life will be easier to do [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4712.28s)]
*  because you do something that's so much more difficult than anything else. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4716.04s)]
*  Yeah. So it's kind of like, you know, taking the cold, the cold plunge, [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4719.2s)]
*  the cold showers, like if I get up and do that, the rest of it, [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4721.6s)]
*  like you see you that first thing in the first thing in the morning, [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4723.68s)]
*  the rest of the day is downhill from there. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4725.84s)]
*  Right. Exactly. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4727.16s)]
*  I get up in the first thing in the morning. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4727.96s)]
*  I'm fucking cold. I go out there. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4729.6s)]
*  I'm in a bathroom like fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4731.16s)]
*  It never feels good. I never want to do it every single time. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4734.32s)]
*  My my bitch ass brain tries to find some way [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4738.0s)]
*  to override my discipline and tell me, you don't have to do it today. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4741.92s)]
*  You've done it three days this week. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4746.68s)]
*  I will take a day off. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4748.32s)]
*  Let's go inside and get a cup of coffee and watch TV. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4749.2s)]
*  I'm like, shut up, pussy. Let's go. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4751.96s)]
*  And then you get in there and I just stare at my stopwatch. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4753.88s)]
*  I stare at the watch and I go, when three minutes is over, [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4757.52s)]
*  I'm going to be so happy I did this. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4760.2s)]
*  And every time three minutes is over, I get out. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4761.84s)]
*  I feel amazing. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4763.96s)]
*  Because you got like I think you've got this crazy, like you said, rapid river. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4765.36s)]
*  Like it keeps circulating water. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4768.8s)]
*  It's called a blue cube. We have it in here. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4770.48s)]
*  Yeah, that thing sucks, but it's awesome. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4772.639999999999s)]
*  But you don't have to have it on. You can turn it off. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4775.5199999999995s)]
*  It's still cold. It's still cold as fuck. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4777.5199999999995s)]
*  But if you really want to experience the stuff, the real suffer, [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4779.839999999999s)]
*  crank that bitch up and it's a raging river. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4784.24s)]
*  Yeah, it just pushes the thermal layer away from you. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4786.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And it's also like really well built. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4789.04s)]
*  It's an awesome machine. I can't recommend it enough. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4791.639999999999s)]
*  Blue cubes are the shit. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4793.959999999999s)]
*  I also at my home, I have a Morosco forge, which is amazing. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4795.36s)]
*  I've been in one of those. Yeah. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4799.16s)]
*  It's great. It's cold as shit. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4800.4s)]
*  The whole thing is just suffering. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4802.0s)]
*  The whole thing is getting your body to adapt to this insane environment, [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4804.04s)]
*  making more brown fat, elevating your cold shock proteins [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4808.5599999999995s)]
*  and also ramping up your dopamine in a significant manner. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4812.5599999999995s)]
*  When you get out of there, your dopamine ramps up for 200 percent. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4816.32s)]
*  And it's like that for hours. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4820.32s)]
*  I remember I can't remember like I used to do ice baths, you know, back [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4822.839999999999s)]
*  way in the day. And I would sit in there for like 30 minutes. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4826.12s)]
*  I mean, it wasn't as cold as it was, but I get out and I'd be euphoric. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4828.64s)]
*  I mean, I would literally be like euphoria. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4831.68s)]
*  It was like I'd shiver. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4833.52s)]
*  But I'd be like it was like I was happy for like hours after. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4834.8s)]
*  That's what it is. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4837.72s)]
*  I have a group of comedians that I'm running on like a little comedy [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4838.8s)]
*  like comedy training boot camp. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4843.6s)]
*  But get them on carnivore, too. I am trying. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4845.52s)]
*  Yes, they're all they're going to do it in January. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4847.8s)]
*  OK, I'm working them up to it now. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4849.96s)]
*  World Carnivore Month, which is when I first did it. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4851.68s)]
*  Yeah. So I've got them now where they're cold [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4853.72s)]
*  plunging after workouts. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4856.72s)]
*  And eventually, like within the next couple of weeks, [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4858.92s)]
*  we're going to start with a cold plunge, which is that's next level. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4862.0s)]
*  That's that's when it gets hard. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4865.360000000001s)]
*  Then I'm saying, look, we go through. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4866.6s)]
*  I start them off. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4868.240000000001s)]
*  Every workout starts out with 100 bodyweight squats, 100 push ups. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4869.16s)]
*  We do. And I tell them, if you can only do five, do five. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4873.08s)]
*  You don't have to do 100. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4875.88s)]
*  You know, like I'm doing sets of 20. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4877.2s)]
*  If you want to do sets of five to five, the most important thing is [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4878.92s)]
*  we want to build a base. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4881.360000000001s)]
*  So if you get to like five and you're struggling, stop right there. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4882.6s)]
*  I'm not trying to kill anybody. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4885.8s)]
*  I'm just trying to give you guys a base so you have a good time. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4887.160000000001s)]
*  So we're all laughing. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4890.04s)]
*  We're having a lot of fun. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4891.4400000000005s)]
*  I'm running through these workouts. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4892.64s)]
*  We're doing it three, four days a week. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4894.160000000001s)]
*  And then we get in the cold plunge. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4895.92s)]
*  We get in the sauna first, which is the way I've been doing it with them. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4897.52s)]
*  So they get to the point where they're actually kind of looking forward [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4900.92s)]
*  to the cold water. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4903.52s)]
*  I don't fuck around with the sauna. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4904.52s)]
*  I get that bitch up to one hundred and eighty five degrees. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4905.6s)]
*  We sit in there for 20 minutes. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4907.84s)]
*  If anybody complains, I throw water on the rocks like, come on, man. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4909.08s)]
*  This is this is the whole I know you can do this. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4912.76s)]
*  I know you don't want to do this, but the whole idea is when it's done, [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4915.28s)]
*  you're going to feel better because you did a thing that you didn't think [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4918.679999999999s)]
*  you could do or you think you had to quit. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4921.44s)]
*  You don't have to quit because sometimes they'll be in there like, [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4923.44s)]
*  I got to get out. Like, no, you don't. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4925.48s)]
*  You have four more minutes. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4927.0s)]
*  You can do anything for four minutes, almost. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4928.36s)]
*  But just fucking concentrate, concentrate and relax and just deal with it. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4930.92s)]
*  Count to 10 and then count to 10 again and then keep doing that. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4935.24s)]
*  And eventually it'll be four minutes. Just do it. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4938.8s)]
*  And then afterwards, I get them in the cold. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4941.12s)]
*  And when I get them in the cold, they get out. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4943.12s)]
*  They're like, oh, my God, I feel amazing. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4944.6s)]
*  I go, don't you feel great? [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4946.84s)]
*  So by doing it this way, where I'm just introducing them [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4948.360000000001s)]
*  first to bodyweight exercises, then to very light kettlebells, [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4953.240000000001s)]
*  you know, like 12 pound swings, cleans presses, some windmills. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4956.96s)]
*  And then now I've got them doing Renegade Rose, a little bit more difficult. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4961.56s)]
*  You know, and then now I've got them doing, you know, like [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4965.52s)]
*  the rogue glute ham machine. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4968.4800000000005s)]
*  So I've got them doing like those sit ups where you hang low [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4971.360000000001s)]
*  and come all the way up. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4973.88s)]
*  I'm like, if you only do three, do three. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4974.72s)]
*  I'm doing sets of 15. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4976.88s)]
*  You don't have to do what I'm doing. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4978.2s)]
*  Just do because I built up to this. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4979.56s)]
*  We're going to do those. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4981.92s)]
*  Then we're going to do some back extensions. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4982.64s)]
*  I'm going to strengthen your core. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4984.12s)]
*  We're going to do some reverse squats with the pulling machine. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4985.400000000001s)]
*  So we're going to do those at 50 percent of your body weight. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4989.4400000000005s)]
*  If you can only do two, do two. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4991.68s)]
*  I want you to get up to 10 and we're going to do sets of 10 eventually. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4993.400000000001s)]
*  But we're going to build a base. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4996.52s)]
*  And so we build this base. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4998.04s)]
*  And now these guys are fucking happy. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=4999.16s)]
*  They're confident. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5001.32s)]
*  They come into the green room before the shows like, dude, I feel fucking great. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5002.28s)]
*  So, yes, because I mean, I imagine like, I mean, you've been a comic for a long time. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5006.2s)]
*  Right. And that's got to be a tough lifestyle, though, in a way, [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5010.759999999999s)]
*  because you're out late at night all the time. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5013.759999999999s)]
*  Yes. Drink and smoke and party. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5015.44s)]
*  I mean, these guys, because I mean, obviously the UFC fighters are a different breed [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5018.04s)]
*  than the comics. And are you finding that like like in your own personal experience [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5021.8s)]
*  that being in shape helps you with your your craft? [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5026.12s)]
*  I mean, I think it helps you with everything in life. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5029.28s)]
*  Because it makes your mind function better. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5031.679999999999s)]
*  People want to think that the mind, the body are two separate things. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5033.639999999999s)]
*  They're not. You're an entity. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5036.5599999999995s)]
*  Your existence is all symbiotic. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5038.4s)]
*  It's all working together. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5041.28s)]
*  If you eat better, if you rest, but look, if I'm tired, [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5042.92s)]
*  like if for some reason I, you know, I had to travel or this or that or something [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5046.759999999999s)]
*  woke me up and I'm not getting any sleep and I have to do stand up and have four hour sleep. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5050.639999999999s)]
*  I don't have as much juice. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5055.04s)]
*  You know, I have to drink like a couple of espressos. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5056.759999999999s)]
*  I have to fucking do some jumping jacks, get my brain fired up. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5059.12s)]
*  And then at night, I'm significantly more tired that day. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5062.5599999999995s)]
*  If I sleep eight hours and I eat really good food and I come in there, [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5065.76s)]
*  I have more energy. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5070.12s)]
*  If you have more energy, you'll be better at everything you do. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5071.2s)]
*  There's not a thing you can do other than sleep, [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5074.36s)]
*  where when you have less energy, you do it better. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5077.5199999999995s)]
*  Nothing else. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5080.08s)]
*  So if you have more energy, you'll be better at comedy. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5081.24s)]
*  You'll be better at talking to people. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5084.28s)]
*  You'll be better at whatever the fuck it is you do. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5085.92s)]
*  Whether you're an accountant or a fucking songwriter, [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5088.679999999999s)]
*  you'll be better at it if you have more energy. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5091.639999999999s)]
*  It's not like mutually exclusive that you have to be a drunk fatso [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5094.44s)]
*  in order to be a funny comedian. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5098.88s)]
*  It's just not true. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5100.28s)]
*  A lot of drunk fatso's are funny comedians because they're wild, [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5101.719999999999s)]
*  impulsive people and that's fun to watch. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5105.639999999999s)]
*  But they can still be all those things and be healthy. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5107.92s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I I think, you know, I'm not not a comic. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5112.28s)]
*  I do some stupid skips or kind of funny. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5115.5199999999995s)]
*  But it takes a lot of creativity, intelligence to be funny. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5117.24s)]
*  I mean, I mean, you would know that. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5120.639999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's like something that a lot of comics are very, very intelligent people. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5121.88s)]
*  I mean, I would, you know. Yes. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5125.679999999999s)]
*  There's a lot of a lot of my friends are surprisingly funny. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5127.599999999999s)]
*  A lot of them are uneducated, but they're also very smart. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5130.4s)]
*  They're very smart. They're very what you call it. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5133.88s)]
*  Street smarter, wise. They get things. They understand people. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5135.5599999999995s)]
*  They're armchair psychologists. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5139.04s)]
*  They understand what makes people think and behave like Patrice O'Neill [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5140.96s)]
*  is one of the greatest comics of all time. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5145.08s)]
*  He was diabetic and he was a big overweight guy. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5146.48s)]
*  But he was brilliant. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5151.08s)]
*  And he had an understanding of human psychology that came from life experience [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5152.5199999999995s)]
*  and whatever shit he went through when he was younger that he brought to the stage. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5157.639999999999s)]
*  And he would have been better if he was healthy, [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5162.759999999999s)]
*  which is crazy because he was so good already. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5165.639999999999s)]
*  So these guys that are training with you, are they all they all live in Austin [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5168.32s)]
*  or local comics and so on? So they're they you've got like a new [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5171.36s)]
*  like a club or something like that, right? [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5174.92s)]
*  The comedy mothership. Yeah. That's in that's downtown. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5176.64s)]

*  A lot. Yeah. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5797.16s)]
*  Said over five, like somewhere in the range of five thousand people [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5797.879999999999s)]
*  texted one of those numbers or something like that. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5800.24s)]
*  I'm sure. I'm sure they did. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5801.96s)]
*  Because if you saw that new off, use this and I don't have to vote in person. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5804.44s)]
*  Yeah. If you're not aware, I could see how that could get you. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5809.08s)]

*  I mean, it's kind of a meme, but it really is. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5817.36s)]
*  That kind of falls under misinformation. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5821.719999999999s)]
*  I don't think the guy should go to jail for it, but it probably [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5823.48s)]
*  you probably shouldn't be allowed to maybe lose your account or something like that. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5826.5599999999995s)]

*  We can't have people eating meat and being healthy and working out. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5862.88s)]
*  That's fucked up. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5865.719999999999s)]
*  I don't know why you did it. And I hope you've changed your ways. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5867.08s)]
*  Well, I'm working on that. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5868.88s)]
*  So like I said, we talked about that debate with the WACOV. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5869.88s)]
*  Oh, my God. That was my favorite one you've ever done. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5872.84s)]
*  So I don't know when this took place, but I just recently it was like two weeks ago. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5875.599999999999s)]

*  But you are debating this guy. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5882.2s)]
*  And you, by the way, you played this brilliantly. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5885.08s)]
*  Well, you just had this like little smile on your face and you let him talk. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5888.5599999999995s)]

*  I think we should replace it with human infrastructure. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5906.320000000001s)]
*  He was saying that he thinks that all animal prey, [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5909.160000000001s)]
*  predators and prey, that's all problematic. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5913.0s)]
*  And we shouldn't have any of that. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5915.92s)]
*  So he's for eliminating all animal life. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5917.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, that's kind of bizarre. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5921.52s)]
*  It's like I was just like, I don't even have to say anything. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5923.04s)]
*  It's not even a debate. All I got to do is just let you talk for like. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5925.0s)]
*  By the way, where does this motherfucker think fertilizer comes from? [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5928.160000000001s)]
*  How are you going to grow your vegetables? [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5931.2s)]
*  Well, he doesn't he doesn't care about that. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5932.76s)]
*  He said basically, I don't care if you kill billions of creatures to grow avocados. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5934.68s)]
*  It doesn't matter to me that that's fine. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5940.2s)]
*  Even if they were he said, even he went as far as say, [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5943.0s)]
*  is even if they were humans, you were slaughtering to produce crops that I ate. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5944.88s)]
*  That's fine. But if you feed it for a cow and then kill the cow, [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5948.8s)]
*  that's a rights violation. That's a problem. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5951.56s)]
*  I'm like, and then he was like, he said he won the debate because I said, [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5953.52s)]
*  I probably wouldn't eat a homo erectus. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5957.88s)]
*  You know, like he said, well, if we could bring back something [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5959.76s)]
*  as close to human human homo sapien, but not exactly. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5961.4400000000005s)]
*  Try to get me to say it's OK to eat humans. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5964.88s)]
*  But but that's how we won the debate. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5967.280000000001s)]
*  That's what I say. He claims he won the debate. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5969.400000000001s)]
*  If you say, I don't think you should eat orangutans. Right. Right. Right. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5971.24s)]
*  Then you're he won. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5974.76s)]
*  Then he won. That was the whole thing. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5976.320000000001s)]
*  It was just it was bizarre. I was just funny. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5977.8s)]
*  I mean, it was hilarious. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5980.4400000000005s)]
*  Well, he's in a cult, you know, whether he realizes it or not. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5981.4800000000005s)]
*  He's in a cult. And this cult is not it's it's not based on any objective [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5984.64s)]
*  assessment of the reality of biological life on Earth. It's just not. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5989.08s)]
*  It's like to say that you think all animal life should die. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5993.24s)]
*  Are you including insects? [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5996.92s)]
*  Because if you include insects, then you're including bees. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=5998.84s)]
*  Then you're there's no pollination. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6002.4s)]
*  You know, what are you saying? [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6004.6s)]
*  Well, I mean, with our species, we if there are no animals, [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6006.24s)]
*  we would all be dead to write. Everything would be gone. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6008.84s)]
*  So it's like, you know, it's almost like, well, you don't really seem like you fit [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6010.84s)]
*  too well on this planet. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6014.12s)]
*  Well, I think that's a deeply unhappy person that's probably very depressed [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6015.72s)]
*  and also a contrarian to the point of complete illogical thinking. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6020.88s)]
*  Like the idea that you would think that all predator and prey animals [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6027.88s)]
*  that exist on Earth, including Africa in the wild, like areas where there are [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6032.72s)]
*  no human beings ever. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6038.16s)]
*  And these animals all coexisted in this very balanced food chain [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6040.32s)]
*  where you have predators and prey and the predators keep the prey animals in check [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6046.88s)]
*  and that there's this like balance in terms of population. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6052.0s)]
*  The fact that you think that human beings should somehow or another stop that [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6055.32s)]
*  and replace it with human infrastructure. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6060.16s)]
*  That's basically what he's saying, right? [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6063.24s)]
*  Pave it all over the parking lot and grow food in a factory. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6064.96s)]
*  And we'll see if you can find that guy. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6067.639999999999s)]
*  It's hilarious because I don't think he understands like plants literally [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6069.08s)]
*  survive on biological material that is being broken down by the natural process [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6074.32s)]
*  and converted into fertilizer. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6082.92s)]
*  That's a literal there's this symbiotic relationship. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6085.0s)]
*  They breathe in carbon dioxide and breathe out oxygen. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6088.84s)]
*  We breathe in oxygen. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6093.4s)]
*  We breathe out carbon dioxide, the more carbon dioxide, which is a real problem [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6095.24s)]
*  with the whole climate crisis things. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6100.2s)]
*  The earth's literally never been greener in observable history. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6102.28s)]
*  Right now, with the higher levels of CO2 in the atmosphere, you literally have a [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6106.599999999999s)]
*  greening of the earth. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6111.5599999999995s)]
*  The whole thing is super complicated. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6113.72s)]
*  And to try to boil it down into some very easy to follow way because it supports [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6116.16s)]
*  your ideology is what most people are doing. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6121.32s)]
*  Yeah, Jamie, if you go to my Instagram, like a couple back, like there was, I [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6124.280000000001s)]
*  think it's like I take on the final vegan boss or something like that. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6129.120000000001s)]
*  It was like, did you put those seed oil bottles behind? [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6131.88s)]
*  No, he did. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6134.88s)]
*  It was his. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6135.72s)]
*  Because he's a big promoted. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6136.88s)]
*  And he thinks, you know, there's a whole argument about, you know, you should be [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6138.0s)]
*  drinking gallons of canola oil and it makes you healthy. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6141.4800000000005s)]
*  So he did this. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6143.4400000000005s)]
*  Is it give me some volume and refresh this so I could hear what this guy says. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6144.240000000001s)]
*  Because it's really funny. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6148.72s)]
*  World into non-existence. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6151.72s)]
*  Right. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6153.28s)]
*  Like I think the wild, I think the natural world is actually morally [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6153.5199999999995s)]
*  problematic and I advocate for its non-existence. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6156.24s)]
*  Can you expand upon that? [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6161.08s)]
*  What does that mean? [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6162.08s)]
*  You advocate for getting rid of the natural world and we are living. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6162.599999999999s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6165.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6166.28s)]
*  The natural world is filled with death and destruction. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6166.5599999999995s)]
*  Things I find morally problematic. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6169.48s)]
*  So I wouldn't, I, what would you replace that with human infrastructure, human [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6171.4s)]
*  infrastructure, and we do, and you're saying we would do a better job as humans. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6176.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6179.88s)]
*  I would even go so far as I think the end goal should be to ditch this ball [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6180.12s)]
*  because it's a liability in and of itself. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6183.599999999999s)]
*  But a lot of people might find that problematic. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6186.32s)]
*  It's fine. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6189.12s)]
*  People are free to think that I have a weird position. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6189.48s)]
*  Just on that show, like, do you see where he's coming from there? [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6191.84s)]
*  I haven't given this. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6194.5599999999995s)]
*  I can, I can see his argument. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6195.36s)]
*  I would disagree with that pretty. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6197.04s)]
*  I don't think you know, that if you make human infrastructure over where there is [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6199.72s)]
*  usually a huge amount of suffering and death and rights violations, most likely [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6204.08s)]
*  this year, so I guess if we're calling. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6208.16s)]
*  Violation, a lion eating a zebra is that would that fall into your [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6210.88s)]
*  definition of a rights violation? [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6213.84s)]
*  On my definition. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6215.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6216.84s)]
*  Okay. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6217.32s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6217.8s)]
*  So who's the other guy? [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6218.16s)]
*  Obviously that is, I'll tell you this. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6218.92s)]
*  So the other guy's name, he's a, he's a vegan activist. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6220.72s)]
*  His name's James Aspie. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6223.2s)]
*  And he would just be like a drug addict and I was vegan. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6225.16s)]
*  And he was like, he made this like rap video saying I wouldn't, I was afraid of [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6227.28s)]
*  him and wouldn't debate him. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6231.16s)]
*  And I was like, okay, whatever. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6232.04s)]
*  So he, he wanted, but he wanted a partner to debate with me. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6234.48s)]
*  And I said, I don't go bring somebody on. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6237.04s)]
*  And this, this is the other guy he picked as his backup as his, and I'm like, [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6238.24s)]
*  he's probably regretting he brought this guy on now. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6242.92s)]
*  Cause he's like such a wacko, but, uh, [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6245.12s)]
*  the guy that you're the other guy, not the final vegan boss, but the other guy [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6247.719999999999s)]
*  is like, don't you see his point? [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6251.8s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6253.32s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6253.92s)]
*  Rights violations, rights violations. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6254.16s)]
*  So a mountain lion eating a mule deer is a rights violation. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6256.92s)]
*  Well, then I asked him, I asked him, cause then I go on to ask him, I said, [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6260.88s)]
*  well, what about the lion that needs to eat? [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6263.84s)]
*  Doesn't he have any rights? [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6265.719999999999s)]
*  He goes, Oh, I don't care about them. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6266.84s)]
*  I'm like, Oh God. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6269.16s)]
*  So let's eat them. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6271.4400000000005s)]
*  Let's eat the lions. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6272.52s)]
*  Let's only eat predators. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6273.4800000000005s)]
*  No, that's a rights violation to a violation to the other. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6274.64s)]
*  They're, they're, they're bizarre. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6278.16s)]
*  It's kind of, well, it's just a complete, it's convenient thinking. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6279.4400000000005s)]
*  That's not based on facts. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6283.2s)]
*  And if you mean, it's one of the things that's been discussed ad nauseam, but [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6284.64s)]
*  Ted Nugent covered it that if you want to kill the most things, eat a vegan [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6288.68s)]
*  diet, if you're thinking, like you made this argument that one cow, like one [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6294.36s)]
*  cow is one life and it's probably better to eat cows because if you eat a cow, [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6299.2s)]
*  that's an enormous animal and you could eat that cow for like six months. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6303.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6307.48s)]
*  How long, how long was that? [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6307.599999999999s)]
*  I'll class you too. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6308.24s)]
*  Months. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6309.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6309.639999999999s)]
*  Months. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6309.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6311.28s)]
*  It's itchy. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6311.44s)]
*  I was just, so I was just in Oregon and that's the end of the Lewis and Clark [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6311.759999999999s)]
*  trail, right? [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6315.839999999999s)]
*  And you read back there, if you ever read like the history of the Lewis and Clark [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6316.719999999999s)]
*  exposition, those guys were eating up to nine pounds of meat a day when they had [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6319.639999999999s)]
*  a lot of game. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6323.639999999999s)]
*  They would like, they had 31 dudes and they would go through like every day they [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6324.16s)]
*  go through four deer or an elk and a deer or a buffalo, a bear, stuff like that. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6326.839999999999s)]
*  Have you ever eaten bear? [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6331.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6332.4s)]
*  I've never had it. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6332.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6333.08s)]
*  How's it taste? [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6333.28s)]
*  I got some here. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6333.919999999999s)]
*  You can have some. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6334.599999999999s)]
*  I'd like to try it. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6335.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6336.2s)]
*  Awesome. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6336.36s)]
*  I'll give you some. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6336.799999999999s)]
*  Awesome. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6338.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6338.32s)]
*  Cam Haynes shot a bear and he turned it into pepperoni sticks. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6338.879999999999s)]
*  What kind of bear was it? [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6341.08s)]
*  Black bear. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6342.0s)]
*  Black bear. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6342.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6343.0s)]
*  But you can eat grizzly bears too. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6343.4s)]
*  The problem with bears is, well, not the real problem in society is that people [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6345.679999999999s)]
*  view them as what my friend Steve Rinell likes to call charismatic megafauna. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6352.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6357.0s)]
*  Because we think of it as like Yogi bear and only you can prevent forest fires [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6357.36s)]
*  and, you know, Teddy bears and all that shit. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6362.16s)]
*  Not teddy bears. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6364.5199999999995s)]
*  But yeah, they're fucking giant predators. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6365.28s)]
*  But when you eat grizzlies and you eat particularly brown bear that are coastal, [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6367.919999999999s)]
*  which are the really large ones, they're eating a lot of fish and they might taste [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6374.799999999999s)]
*  like shit. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6378.2s)]
*  Whereas if you get a black bear that is munching on blueberries, they're sensational. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6379.16s)]
*  Steve Rinell says it's some of the best meat he's ever eaten in his life. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6384.5599999999995s)]
*  And when there's a video of him, see if you could find a Steve Rinell blueberry bear. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6387.8s)]
*  So they specifically target these fall bears that are eating blueberries. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6393.76s)]
*  And when he opens it up, he says, they smell like blueberries. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6400.36s)]
*  Their fat is purple. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6403.72s)]
*  And he said the meat is delicious. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6405.599999999999s)]
*  So this is an interesting thing because this is like, oh yeah, see. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6407.64s)]
*  So that's so this is him, right? [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6412.120000000001s)]
*  What he's doing now. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6414.84s)]
*  Yeah, this is Steve after he's shot the animal. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6415.76s)]
*  And these are pieces of meat that he's quartered up. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6417.68s)]
*  And so he's taking this fat and this fat has a blue. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6420.4400000000005s)]
*  See how it has like a blue hue to it. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6424.52s)]
*  Yeah, that's from the berry. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6426.52s)]
*  And give me some volume. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6429.08s)]
*  So it's saying, oh, there's good stuff right there. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6433.08s)]
*  So he's going to start. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6436.72s)]
*  He's up in Alaska or something like that. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6437.96s)]
*  Well, he lives in Montana, but he has a fish shack in Alaska. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6439.56s)]
*  And I think I believe he was hunting them in Alaska. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6444.6s)]
*  Because that's where, you know, he just he'll specifically target them [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6450.04s)]
*  where they're eating blueberries. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6454.2s)]
*  Getting in the third line here by some rare red meat. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6456.0s)]
*  There's some good stuff. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6460.96s)]
*  And so what he's doing now is he's going to use a jet boil. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6462.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6466.08s)]
*  And he's going to cook the meat in the fat. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6466.44s)]
*  So that fat, if you look at it, it's got like a blue hue to it, [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6470.16s)]
*  like a reddish blue hue to it from blueberries. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6473.48s)]
*  So he cooks that down, gets the oil, gets it fat. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6476.5199999999995s)]
*  And then he dunks. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6480.68s)]
*  So he gets a bunch of hot melted fat and then he cooks. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6485.04s)]
*  It's like confit. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6487.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6488.28s)]
*  Confit duck. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6488.5199999999995s)]
*  Yes. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6489.24s)]
*  You have to make sure you cook it to 150 plus degrees to avoid trichinosis. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6489.64s)]
*  I forget what the number is. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6494.48s)]
*  That fat will wind up sitting on top of the water. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6495.5599999999995s)]
*  But for deep frying meat, it's better to have pure oil. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6499.2s)]
*  But if you just wanted oil out to drink, just if you needed like, [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6504.12s)]
*  you know, a quick energy charge, you can do it that way a lot faster [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6508.08s)]
*  than rendering it like this. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6511.96s)]
*  My brother, one time I watched him, he like rendered a mug full of bear [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6513.2s)]
*  fat and just drank it like coffee. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6516.639999999999s)]
*  That's how good that stuff is. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6518.96s)]
*  And hunters like Daniel Boone, I mean, that guy would shoot [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6521.0s)]
*  bears just for oil. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6523.68s)]
*  You can sell the stuff that was a marketable commodity. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6525.12s)]
*  You can continue to cook these fat pieces down, down, down. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6528.76s)]
*  And those might be crispy little treats like a little pork. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6532.360000000001s)]
*  How hard is it to get a bear tag? [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6534.76s)]
*  It's not that hard, depending on where you go. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6537.08s)]
*  They're overpopulated in a lot of areas. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6539.08s)]
*  You want to hear something crazy? [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6541.400000000001s)]
*  What state would you think has the largest population of bears per capita? [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6542.64s)]
*  Per capita? Yeah. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6547.0s)]
*  Take a guess. Per capita, Wyoming. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6548.4400000000005s)]
*  New Jersey. New Jersey. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6551.56s)]
*  New Jersey is a real bear problem. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6553.08s)]
*  There's a lot of people living in New Jersey. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6554.16s)]
*  I know a kid a few years back [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6555.48s)]
*  who was going to Rutgers got killed by a bear out there. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6558.36s)]
*  Wow. Yeah. Black bears. Black bear. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6560.68s)]
*  Yeah. Black bears are more likely for some reason to kill people for food, [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6562.68s)]
*  whereas brown bears and grizzly bears, generally they kill people [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6567.84s)]
*  because they get startled or it's a mama and her cubs. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6571.04s)]
*  I had a black bear walk through my backyard. [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6574.24s)]
*  It was like got on video with like up in Washington. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6575.96s)]
*  Pretty cool. Yeah, it's pretty good. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6578.32s)]
*  My my my spouse is taking a bath. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6579.5599999999995s)]
*  She heard the dogs bark and she looks out there as a frigging bear walk. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6582.0s)]
*  I was out of town. She's like, oh, my God, there's a bear. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6584.240000000001s)]
*  But the interesting thing, you know, it's about the blue. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6586.280000000001s)]
*  You said about the blue stuff in the fat. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6587.92s)]
*  So and I, Jamie, I've got a paper, I think, is from Stefan van Vliet [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6590.0s)]
*  about phytonutrients in meat. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6593.16s)]
*  So we talk about phytonutrients, right? [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6594.96s)]
*  You got to you got to get all your plants, get your phytonutrients. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6596.68s)]
*  Meat actually contains thousands of phytonutrients. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6599.52s)]
*  So one of those animals graze, they actually absorb that phytonutrients [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6602.88s)]
*  and it goes into their fat, into their tissue. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6605.96s)]
*  And so you actually get it [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6607.72s)]
*  in almost as much or even more than you can get in plants, [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6609.4s)]
*  because we ignore that. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6612.44s)]
*  But meat like Stefan van Vliet, who is a researcher [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6613.679999999999s)]
*  out of initially out of Duke, he's not like Utah State, [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6617.32s)]
*  showed that meat has something like 50000 unique compounds. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6620.639999999999s)]
*  It's not just amino acids and a little bit of vitamins and minerals. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6624.679999999999s)]
*  It's 50000 unique compounds, and many of them are phytonutrients. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6627.599999999999s)]
*  So it's pretty amazing. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6632.04s)]
*  Because like a bear can eat a lot more than I can. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6633.32s)]
*  Health-promoting phytonutrients are higher in grass-fed meat and milk. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6636.4400000000005s)]
*  But you don't necessarily gravitate towards grass-fed. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6639.76s)]
*  I do both. You know, it's one of those things is, you know, I mean, [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6642.52s)]
*  I don't know what your opinion is on taste. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6645.16s)]
*  I mean, I know you like a lot of a lot of elk. And so I [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6647.08s)]
*  you know, I get it's kind of funny because I become like the meathead guy. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6651.16s)]
*  Right. Like everybody. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6653.4800000000005s)]
*  I get a lot of ranchers to send me stuff. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6654.64s)]
*  They're like, here, have some have some meat, have some free meat. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6656.36s)]
*  I'm like, oh, yeah, I'll eat that stuff. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6658.4400000000005s)]
*  And I get, you know, I get a little bit everything. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6660.32s)]
*  I get some really crazy like there's a there's a well, one in Colorado, [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6661.88s)]
*  craft beef, which Jaco is invested in. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6666.04s)]
*  He's part of that partnership. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6667.96s)]
*  They got really good meat. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6670.4800000000005s)]
*  But it's it's it's you know, it's pasture raised and then they feed it. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6671.400000000001s)]
*  They finish it out themselves and then have their own facility. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6674.4800000000005s)]
*  But there's like one in like Montana. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6677.24s)]
*  They finished their cows out on sprouts, which is kind of interesting. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6680.400000000001s)]
*  And sprouts can grow like you don't even need light. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6684.76s)]
*  All you need is water and you grow and they grow very massively. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6688.16s)]
*  And so this guy said in a building that's like 40 by 60, [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6691.0s)]
*  he can grow enough sprouts to finish out 400 head of cattle, [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6694.84s)]
*  which takes almost no room. It's like amazing. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6698.280000000001s)]
*  So it's called McCafferty Ranch Beef up in Montana. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6700.64s)]
*  And they're trying to, you know, trying to spread this [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6703.72s)]
*  because you think about we're talking about how do we sustainably feed people [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6705.84s)]
*  more meat, because I think that's a real issue. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6708.88s)]
*  And that's, you know, one of those things that's that's out there. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6711.240000000001s)]
*  So it's kind of because I think, you know, again, [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6714.04s)]
*  I don't think everybody needs to be on carnival, [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6717.04s)]
*  but I think we should probably eat less junk food, more meat. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6718.8s)]
*  I mean, I think that would be a clear win for for society in general. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6721.32s)]
*  And it's like, well, how do you do that? [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6724.639999999999s)]
*  I mean, we used to have, you know, this is this goes back to the beef checkoff. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6725.8s)]
*  I mean, their job is to promote beef. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6729.0s)]
*  But since 1977, our beef consumption in the U.S. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6730.32s)]
*  is down like 30, 40 percent. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6733.5599999999995s)]
*  And yet diseases are going up. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6735.8s)]
*  So it's like the exact opposite direction. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6737.2s)]
*  And literally like half a million ranchers have gone out of business since the 70s. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6739.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean, it's like we talk about three thousand ranchers [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6744.719999999999s)]
*  or three thousand farms closing in in the Netherlands. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6746.88s)]
*  Half a million have gone out of business here in the U.S., which is crazy. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6749.6s)]
*  I'm always trying to support your local rancher, you know, [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6752.8s)]
*  whatever your preference is, but, you know, get these guys out there. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6755.320000000001s)]
*  Because I don't know. I mean, these guys are good. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6757.88s)]
*  I mean, this like everybody. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6759.68s)]
*  I mean, the ranchers are hardworking people. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6760.4800000000005s)]
*  I think they're one of the backbones of this country. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6762.280000000001s)]
*  I mean, you know, you get people that they feed you. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6765.120000000001s)]
*  I mean, what it was because it used to be back in, you know, 200 years ago, [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6766.8s)]
*  everybody had produced their own food. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6770.320000000001s)]
*  Now you got like two percent of the population feeding all the rest of us. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6772.4400000000005s)]
*  And I mean, you know, I mean, I had Walt Harris, [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6776.080000000001s)]
*  a Will Harris, Will Harris, Will Harrison is sorry, Will, [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6778.759999999999s)]
*  and his daughter, Jenny on recently, and they explained. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6782.24s)]
*  I've had Will on twice and explained his situation [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6785.48s)]
*  where he developed this regenerative farm from what used to be an industrialized [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6789.48s)]
*  farm and how difficult it was. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6794.24s)]
*  I'm reading his book right now. It's amazing. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6795.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, it's amazing. I've interviewed Will before tonight. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6797.36s)]
*  I've interviewed all these regenerative guys and I'm totally for that. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6799.44s)]
*  I think it's wonderful. It's great. It improves the ecosystem. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6802.919999999999s)]
*  It's like something we need more of. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6806.08s)]
*  It's just, you know, incentivizing the guys because a lot of the guys are on [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6808.08s)]
*  like more kind of a commodity beef, which he likes to call it. [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6810.76s)]
*  He doesn't like it anymore. [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6813.96s)]
*  But a lot of those guys like I just I'm worried I'm going to go out of business [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6814.92s)]
*  if I try this because maybe they're maybe they're up in North Dakota [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6818.5599999999995s)]
*  or it's snowed all the time. Right. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6821.5199999999995s)]
*  Where am I going to get the alfalfa and the hay to feed the stuff? [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6823.68s)]
*  And it's just it's kind of, you know, it's what you have to do. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6826.24s)]
*  You have to do. Yeah. He's lucky he's in Georgia. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6829.84s)]
*  Well, he's in a good place. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6832.16s)]
*  He's like he admits I've got perfect land for this and everybody has it. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6833.04s)]
*  So but he's also recreating nature in a contained environment, [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6836.44s)]
*  which is really what we should all be striving for. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6840.5199999999995s)]
*  What we want is these animals to exist in a way that's ethical, humane, [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6842.879999999999s)]
*  and that they exist in a way that they have existed for hundreds of thousands [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6847.599999999999s)]
*  of years. And that's how they're healthy. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6852.36s)]
*  And if you eat that, you will be healthier. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6854.48s)]
*  There's no pesticides, herbicides, no no bullshit involved. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6857.08s)]
*  Well, that's really because you've heard of glyphosate. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6861.0s)]
*  They spray it on everything. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6863.48s)]
*  They've been spraying on everything since, I don't know, the 1980s or something like that. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6864.32s)]
*  Now it's showing up in your urine. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6867.24s)]
*  And it's most of it accumulates in like grains and legumes and stuff like that's [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6869.32s)]
*  where it's most densely found. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6875.24s)]
*  So if you want to avoid that stuff, don't eat that stuff. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6876.44s)]
*  Eat more of a meat base because because mammals basically, you know, [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6879.16s)]
*  break it down so it doesn't really show up in their meat and their milk very much. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6882.599999999999s)]
*  It's very, very limited. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6885.48s)]
*  But it's you know, it's like these guys that are doergenic, they don't they don't [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6886.599999999999s)]
*  need any herbicides. They don't need any pesticides. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6891.48s)]
*  Yeah. Get rid of all that stuff saves them money in the long run. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6893.32s)]
*  But it's like like they said, you've got to go through the threat of going out of business [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6896.5599999999995s)]
*  for five years or six years before you can make it. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6900.599999999999s)]
*  Which is what took him like 20 years to convert that farm. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6902.879999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Which is an amazing task that he achieved. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6906.0s)]
*  And but because of that, it's like a shining light to all these people. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6909.839999999999s)]
*  I mean, we should subsidize that stuff is what we should do instead of subsidizing all these [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6914.12s)]
*  wheat and grain and corn commodities, which go into potato chips and garbage. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6917.48s)]
*  Yeah. Well, that's what's crazy about, you know, we demonize Russia, but Putin banned GMO foods. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6921.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, do you see what they did in Italy? Maloney said no, no lab grown meat. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6927.32s)]
*  Because that's another thing, you know, that's because, you know, the plant like people have [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6930.879999999999s)]
*  caught on to the Beyond Burgers and Impossible Meat. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6934.919999999999s)]
*  It's just all ultra processed garbage and nobody and the people are speaking [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6937.679999999999s)]
*  with their wallet, which is what I look at. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6941.5199999999995s)]
*  You know, when I look at all the corporate sort of malfeasance and the corporate influence, [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6944.2s)]
*  you know, the corporations own the politicians, you got to know that. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6948.8s)]
*  I mean, they're they're paying the politicians and, you know, in one way or another. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6952.16s)]
*  And it's like, what can I do as a what can I do as a lone individual? [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6956.400000000001s)]
*  And it's like all you can do really is vote with your pocketbook. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6960.16s)]
*  And just every time you go to the store and you buy that bullshit, that crappy food, [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6963.16s)]
*  you put more money in their pockets and they have more power over you. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6967.16s)]
*  And so I'm just like, you got to you got to turn it around. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6970.0s)]
*  Yeah, in a perfect world, they would invest all their money into regenerative farming. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6972.4s)]
*  And they would change if people change their diet and they realize, look, [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6977.24s)]
*  the only thing people are buying is grass fed meat and organic vegetables, [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6980.72s)]
*  all from regenerative organic farms. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6985.68s)]
*  If that really became something that was sustainable, they would try to pursue that. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6988.12s)]
*  Yeah. No, I think I think the market will dictate where things go. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6993.08s)]
*  And it's just convincing the market that, hey, look, you know, [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=6996.72s)]
*  if you want to continue to be sad and depressed and miserable, [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7000.24s)]
*  keep doing what you're doing. But you got to change it. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7005.4400000000005s)]
*  You know, you got to make a big change. And that's what, you know, I mean, [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7007.400000000001s)]
*  we're told not to do it. It's like that USDA study. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7010.52s)]
*  Hey, 91 percent processed food diet. I'd say, OK, keep eating this way. [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7013.16s)]
*  So crazy. It is crazy. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7016.84s)]
*  That's why what makes that sort of propaganda so insidious is like [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7018.400000000001s)]
*  you're literally holding back people from gaining health and gaining control [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7022.28s)]
*  of their health. And you're the evidence is clear [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7025.96s)]
*  in terms of you just look at what people used to look like and what they look [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7029.56s)]
*  like now. Something's wrong. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7032.64s)]
*  Something's really wrong. And all that comes from diet. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7034.76s)]
*  Yeah. Centenary lifestyle and diet. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7038.240000000001s)]
*  Well, that's but I mean, I will say this and because I mean, I'm sure you agree [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7040.360000000001s)]
*  that what distinguishes healthy people that age in a very healthy manner? [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7043.88s)]
*  I mean, diet is important. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7047.88s)]
*  And I'm a huge proponent of that. But physical activity and exercise [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7048.88s)]
*  is such a huge. I mean, I don't care what diet you are. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7053.4400000000005s)]
*  You need to be taking care of your health. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7056.4800000000005s)]
*  And I think, you know, because I hear because I hear it all the time. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7058.44s)]
*  Well, you're in your 50s. You need to slow down. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7061.599999999999s)]
*  You need you not. You need not be doing that stuff because you're going to get hurt. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7063.5199999999995s)]
*  And it's time to get down. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7066.28s)]
*  But I mean, I've heard that since I've been 20 or 30. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7067.5599999999995s)]
*  Oh, you're 30. You got to slow down. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7069.879999999999s)]
*  Yeah. I think once you lose capacity, like, you know, if you say like my 100 [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7071.759999999999s)]
*  percent was here and then you say, I'm not going to do 100 percent anymore. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7075.44s)]
*  I'm just going to do 90 percent. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7078.28s)]
*  Well, that 90 percent is now your 100 percent. Yeah. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7079.36s)]
*  And then you keep doing it. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7081.599999999999s)]
*  And all of a sudden, it's like, you know, walking down the street is now a chore. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7082.4s)]
*  You know, right. And you see so many people. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7085.719999999999s)]
*  It's like I had a guy talk to me about I thought it was a good this guy named Ted [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7087.52s)]
*  Naiman. He's a doctor that I interviewed one time. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7091.160000000001s)]
*  He said, you know, what happens is over life, you have this sort of spectrum of [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7093.0s)]
*  things you can do. This is me laying in bed and this is me doing backflips. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7097.64s)]
*  Right. And then it gets smaller and smaller and smaller. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7101.320000000001s)]
*  And eventually you're like, all I can do is walk around the house and then I can do [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7104.68s)]
*  the lay in bed and then you're dead. [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7107.6s)]
*  So you need to keep this as broad as possible. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7108.72s)]
*  And that's why I say when people say you need to slow down, I'm like, bullshit, man. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7111.6s)]
*  I'm going to get you know, you got to be trained. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7115.0s)]
*  You got to train smart. You don't get hurt. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7116.080000000001s)]
*  But you need to push yourself. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7117.839999999999s)]
*  Well, also, if anybody watches your workouts, clearly you don't need to slow down [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7119.28s)]
*  because you're doing some pretty extraordinary stuff and you're deep into your 50s. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7124.0s)]
*  Yeah. It's like when the same thing. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7128.32s)]
*  Right. Yeah. And we were kids. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7129.919999999999s)]
*  We were told that when you get into your 50s, it's over. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7131.4s)]
*  You know, it's have you ever seen those images where they show the Archie Bunker [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7134.44s)]
*  and Judith Bunker? [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7139.08s)]
*  When they're like they're like they're like 38. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7140.2s)]
*  I'm like, shit, Fred Sanford was like 48 when he was at Sanford and Sons. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7141.919999999999s)]
*  It's crazy. Big belly, gray hair. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7145.24s)]
*  I can't believe that stuff. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7147.16s)]
*  They weren't healthy. They didn't take care of themselves. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7148.599999999999s)]
*  That's amazing. They didn't work out. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7150.68s)]
*  But if you look at some people today like yourself and it's like [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7152.4s)]
*  this whole new standard. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7155.32s)]
*  You look at guys like Stallone and Swartz and Herthen in their mid 70s now, [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7156.04s)]
*  and they're still like, I mean, granted that, you know, they're taking stuff. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7160.36s)]
*  But I mean, at the same point, we've never had a time in human history [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7163.16s)]
*  where we've experienced people that are pushing it that way and still training [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7167.4s)]
*  hard in the late years. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7170.32s)]
*  And I've seen, you know, I've seen people like in their 90s. [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7171.96s)]
*  I saw a guy who's 91 years old. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7174.68s)]
*  He's deadlifting 405. [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7176.84s)]
*  That's for a triple at 90. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7178.72s)]
*  And he only weighs like 148. That's incredible. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7180.28s)]
*  It's like, where did this guy come from? [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7182.360000000001s)]
*  Right. It's like, what is going to be possible? [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7183.92s)]
*  And, you know, you know, like I said, I don't know. [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7185.88s)]
*  I always the longevity stuff. [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7188.16s)]
*  I was like, I don't know. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7190.32s)]
*  I mean, I don't think anybody really, really knows. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7191.400000000001s)]
*  I think you're just speculating. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7193.28s)]
*  My thing is like, let's get healthy today. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7194.68s)]
*  Let's stop being sick. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7197.56s)]
*  And then and then just keep doing that. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7198.76s)]
*  And then if you live extra long, great. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7200.4400000000005s)]
*  But, you know, because a lot of people say, well, if you eat a carnivore diet, [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7202.28s)]
*  you're going to have a heart attack at 60. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7205.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm like, I don't know that that's true. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7207.32s)]
*  I mean, maybe I will. But I don't think that's I don't think we have enough data [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7209.36s)]
*  to support that. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7212.2s)]
*  What I can say is like, if you're sick, you're diabetic, you're fat, [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7213.32s)]
*  you're high blood pressure. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7216.32s)]
*  I can fix that by diet. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7217.5599999999995s)]
*  Let's just do that. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7219.4s)]
*  And I think we would just focus on that instead of like protecting people [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7220.28s)]
*  from cancer when they're 90, which is like you don't even know. [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7223.5599999999995s)]
*  It's the evidence is so bad on that stuff. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7226.48s)]
*  Well, what we know, what you can do for what you are right now, [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7229.16s)]
*  where you are right now, that if you change your diet [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7234.12s)]
*  and you eat healthier foods and you exercise, you'll feel better. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7237.24s)]
*  You'll be better. That's a fact. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7240.96s)]
*  Whether or not you're looking at like, look, clearly, these people [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7243.44s)]
*  that are eating off the Twinkie tree, they're not worried about being [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7246.48s)]
*  150 years old either. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7248.92s)]
*  Like that's this is nonsense. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7250.44s)]
*  And that's a bullshit argument. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7252.08s)]
*  Like you're going to get a heart attack or die young. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7253.5199999999995s)]
*  And what your sedentary lifestyle eating fucking Oreos, [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7255.76s)]
*  you're going to be OK. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7259.44s)]
*  I mean, there's some people that say we've only got a limited number of heartbeats. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7260.76s)]
*  And I don't want to hear that argument. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7264.12s)]
*  I'm just like, what? You got to be crazy. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7265.96s)]
*  But that's based on who and what? [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7267.32s)]
*  Like based on what says who? [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7269.5199999999995s)]
*  That doesn't make any sense. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7272.72s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7274.36s)]
*  Do we have a number of calf contractions that you're allowed to have? [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7276.0s)]
*  Your heart is a muscle. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7279.92s)]
*  Like, who says if your heart is healthier because your whole body is healthy [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7281.08s)]
*  and you're more metabolically healthy, I would imagine that everything's healthier. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7285.28s)]
*  Your brain, you're like people that are fit and older. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7288.96s)]
*  Their brains work better. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7291.96s)]
*  Everything works better. [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7293.08s)]
*  Yeah, good. Let me. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7294.8s)]
*  Hey, Jamie, there's a picture of a gal with blonde hair. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7296.44s)]
*  Do you see that one? [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7298.68s)]
*  I just want to I just want to show this guy because it's quite interesting [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7299.72s)]
*  because people are asking, where's the people that have been doing carnivore for a while? [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7302.28s)]
*  So this is there's a rancher. Her name is Maggie. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7305.92s)]
*  I can't remember. Maybe Maggie Widersom. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7308.2s)]
*  She's up in Alberta, Canada. [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7309.48s)]
*  She's been doing supposedly a carnivore diet since she's like 15. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7310.64s)]
*  She's now 82. [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7313.92s)]
*  And if you can find a picture, she just looks like that's her. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7315.8s)]
*  She's 82. That's insane. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7318.68s)]
*  And she's busting her ass, working on a ranch every day. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7320.32s)]
*  She's learning Spanish because she's getting tired. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7323.64s)]
*  How the Canadian government screwing her answer. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7325.48s)]
*  She wants to move down to Bolivia and start a new ranch in Bolivia. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7327.28s)]
*  She's 82. She's starting a new ranch in Bolivia. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7330.04s)]
*  And that's that's a current picture. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7333.16s)]
*  And a friend of mine went to go visit her and like look at her birth certificate [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7335.24s)]
*  and her driver's line verified. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7337.96s)]
*  And that's literally what she looks like at 82. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7339.72s)]
*  So it's like, well, that's 82 years of no bullshit in your body. [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7341.4s)]
*  I'm being physically active. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7344.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, it's amazing. It can do that for you. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7345.8s)]
*  So we'll see what happens. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7347.6s)]
*  You know, like I said, if the vegans are right, [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7348.6s)]
*  we're you and I are dropping dead of a heart attack in six months. [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7350.12s)]
*  They're going to drop dead, too. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7353.32s)]
*  Listen, that's that's the funny thing. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7354.52s)]
*  So I had, you know, talking about debating the vegans. [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7356.4400000000005s)]
*  I used to not do it because it's such a waste. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7358.84s)]
*  I find it was a waste of time. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7360.92s)]
*  But now I'm kind of humoring it just because I don't know. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7361.96s)]
*  I guess I'm bored. But well, listen, if you can get a result [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7363.96s)]
*  like the guy with the canola oil behind him, that's amazing entertainment. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7366.2s)]
*  It was. I thought it was it didn't. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7370.2s)]
*  I didn't learn anything except how crazy these people are. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7372.2s)]
*  But I had a guy that I was like, you know, he said, well, you know, [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7374.52s)]
*  you're going to get cancer or heart disease. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7377.16s)]
*  And I said, hey, well, what do you think vegans are dying of? [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7379.32s)]
*  Right. What do you what do you think they die of? [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7382.12s)]
*  And he goes, oh, I don't know, skiing accidents. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7383.5599999999995s)]
*  And I was like, that's bullshit, man. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7386.04s)]
*  They're all dying skiing. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7387.64s)]
*  So they didn't ski. They'd live forever. [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7388.92s)]
*  Right. Right. So I go. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7390.44s)]
*  So I looked it up and I looked I looked up studies [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7391.96s)]
*  that actually had endpoints of death on vegans. [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7394.36s)]
*  And number one cause of death is heart disease and cancer. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7396.76s)]
*  It's like, you guys have the same thing. Everybody else. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7400.12s)]
*  So I got all those years of suffering and farting and pretending, you know, [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7402.28s)]
*  virtue for what you die, drop dead anyway. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7406.04s)]
*  Well, another part of the problem is they've become attached to an ideology [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7409.24s)]
*  that's very difficult for them to escape. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7412.68s)]
*  And when they do try to escape that ideology, they get attacked. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7414.599999999999s)]
*  Oh, it's amazing. By their people. Oh, my God. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7418.2s)]
*  There was this one vegan influencer who ate a piece of salmon [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7421.0s)]
*  and just felt amazing. I believe so. [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7424.599999999999s)]
*  And then they started fucking attacking her and she was crying and oh, [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7427.32s)]
*  but immediately started feeling better because she's giving her body what she needs. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7432.44s)]
*  How many of these people are suffering and how many like if you think of the vitriol [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7437.4s)]
*  that comes from the vegan community and so much anger and so much hate and [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7441.08s)]
*  just horrible things they say about people. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7446.679999999999s)]
*  How much of that is based on like hurt people hurt people. Right. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7449.08s)]
*  How much of that is based on them being in pain and them being in agony, [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7452.28s)]
*  whether it's mental anguish because their brains not functioning well, [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7456.759999999999s)]
*  their bodies are fine. They're overwhelmed with inflammation. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7460.04s)]
*  Their guts are filled with fiber. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7462.679999999999s)]
*  Well, I mean, if you imagine like if you literally like believe the ideology really hard, [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7464.52s)]
*  you literally hate almost all of humanity. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7470.040000000001s)]
*  It's like every ninety nine out of 100 people you see, you're like, [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7472.52s)]
*  I hate you because you're a murderer. Right. [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7475.160000000001s)]
*  You know, it's like, how do you how do you even live in a society where you literally [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7477.080000000001s)]
*  hate every human being around you? I mean, it's got to be crazy. [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7481.400000000001s)]
*  It's not good for you. Yeah, that's not good. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7484.280000000001s)]
*  For sure. Yeah, there was a guy in that movie, Game Changers, you know, that vegan sports film. [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7486.6s)]
*  And he was he was he was going to be in the movie. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7491.0s)]
*  They had they had film boss of his name is Tim Sheaf. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7494.12s)]
*  He was like an obstacle course, like, you know, those obstacle race guys, right? [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7496.52s)]
*  Ninja guy, American Ninja type thing. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7500.04s)]
*  And he was like the vegan prince. Like they loved him. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7502.12s)]
*  And then he said he got sick and he was like, I couldn't do it anymore. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7504.76s)]
*  And they like literally threw him out of the movie. [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7507.72s)]
*  Well, there's so many stories of that. Yeah, that's what's fascinating. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7511.4s)]
*  There's so many stories of people who were vegan that had to abandon it, [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7514.68s)]
*  including a lot of celebrities that have come out. [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7518.52s)]
*  And when they do that, they get attacked. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7520.5199999999995s)]
*  They get attacked viciously instead of people going interesting. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7522.2s)]
*  That's an interesting point of data. Instead of saying it that way, [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7525.0s)]
*  you're going against an ideology. It's not about facts. [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7528.04s)]
*  It's not about the reality of the science or what we know about nutrition in the human body. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7531.16s)]
*  It's about being attached to this ideology that makes you superior [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7537.4s)]
*  morally to the people that are around you. Yeah, I always laugh when they say I'm going [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7540.599999999999s)]
*  to eat this guilt free whatever salad. I'm like, no, there's a lot of things [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7544.28s)]
*  that die to get you that salad. They're just like, although that doesn't count. [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7548.2s)]
*  Or it's kind of crazy. But they'll point out there are some, [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7551.24s)]
*  there literally are people that do reasonably well on a vegan diet. [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7555.24s)]
*  I mean, you probably see, I don't know if you know, I'm sure you know him. [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7558.92s)]
*  They talk about Nate Diaz. He's a UFC fighter. He's not vegan. [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7562.2s)]
*  That's what I heard. He eats fish and stuff like that. [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7564.599999999999s)]
*  No. But they always point to Nate Diaz. [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7566.5199999999995s)]
*  He eats eggs. Right. They point to him as the guy. [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7567.88s)]
*  No. Like Novik Djokovic, who also is not vegan, [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7569.88s)]
*  but they keep pointing to him. It's just kind of like, [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7573.16s)]
*  as he also eats fish and stuff like that. Well, how about when they put athletes on [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7574.84s)]
*  vegan diets, they get these catastrophic injuries? Yeah. [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7577.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. We have, Cam Newton was the prototype for that. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7580.360000000001s)]
*  I mean, he's just clear with them. There's a bunch of those guys because [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7583.88s)]
*  you're not getting a lot of the things that you need. You're not getting creatine, [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7586.12s)]
*  unless you're supplementing. You're not getting... You're not getting taurine, [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7590.12s)]
*  carnitine, carnitine. I mean, all these things that are either conditionally [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7593.400000000001s)]
*  beneficial or absolutely needed. And you just not seeing that. So we see that. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7597.08s)]
*  There was a depression study, Stanford University, 2018. People with major depressive [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7601.5599999999995s)]
*  disorders have low levels of carnitine. Where do you get carnitine from? You pretty much only [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7608.28s)]
*  get it from animal products. And so it's like your brain turns back on these people, [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7612.44s)]
*  say like their brain reset when they got the right food. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7617.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, listen, man, I'm glad you're out there preaching the gospel and I'm glad you're still [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7620.04s)]
*  alive all these years later. You're still healthy and everything's fine. And I think what you're [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7626.28s)]
*  doing is important because I think people need to understand that we've been kind of hoodwinked in [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7631.96s)]
*  more ways than one and that you can kind of follow the chain of evidence and you can figure out how [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7637.32s)]
*  this happened and why this happened. And it's not to preserve your health. It's not evidence-based. [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7642.2s)]
*  And when you look at the real evidence that supports vegan diets and supports that meat is [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7648.44s)]
*  bad for you, you find out that that's a bunch of chicanery too. There's a lot of bullshit going on [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7653.32s)]
*  there. And so I'm glad you're out there, Sean. Appreciate it. Appreciate you giving me the [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7657.32s)]
*  platform to talk on this joke. Because I think, like I said, it's literally, it's helping people. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7660.599999999999s)]
*  And I think anything that helps people we should be in favor of. And like I said, I think because [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7665.4s)]
*  we're seeing people are like saying we need to shut down meat. We can't eat it anymore. And I [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7669.96s)]
*  think that's a really, it's going to have some really bad unintended consequences. I agree. So [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7674.44s)]
*  tell everybody where they can find your content and your social media. [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7679.16s)]
*  Yeah. So first thing company, revero.com, R-E-V-E-R-O, if you want to get your health taken care of, [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7682.2s)]

*  I'm at SbakerMD. I've got a YouTube channel, it's Sean Baker, MD. And that's mostly where I'll be. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7698.28s)]
*  All right, brother. Thanks for being here. Appreciate you. [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VftiRHObhcU&t=7705.32s)]
