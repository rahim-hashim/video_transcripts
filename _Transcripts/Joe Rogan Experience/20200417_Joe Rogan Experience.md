# Joe Rogan Experience #1460 - Donnell Rawlings
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [April 17, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXFlwSr5u_k)
*  One done. Oh, we're live. Mm-hmm
*  So good to see you
*  Okay, this is not the cough that people expect this is just a weed cough
*  Don't know has not been tested he will be tested
*  podcast
*  Give me a chance
*  Give me a chance and and and I understand
*  But I have subscribed
*  Six feet I have my measure. I have subscribed to social distancing social distance
*  I want to be sent but the new normal to do this. I'm can't we should move over a little bit
*  Don't the new normal in a new normal
*  Joe but just
*  I'm protected possibly protected myself
*  From me for me right to you. Okay, and I love you
*  We have a certain amount of trust factor, but this 19 shit is kind of dead and how
*  trustworthy
*  This is well, first of all, I think what's really important for everybody right now is to strengthen your music first of all
*  Can I tell you something?
*  Yeah, we will take that fucking thing. All right, I knew motherfuckers don't give a fuck about
*  Yo, what's he help you don't give a fuck about no cove
*  Well, that's one thing is like eating well eat healthy take vitamins
*  This is what you need to take for sure vitamin C
*  Large doses of vitamin C vitamin D and zinc those are very important right now, right and just
*  Doesn't isn't zinc aphrodisiac?
*  It's good for lose so you can get your immune system up and get everything
*  That's all connected to your body being healthy, you know, the more vital your body is the more vitality you have
*  You know the more your everything's gonna work better your hormones your immune system everything
*  So those are those are things that I recommend to everybody and nobody's thinking about that Joe. Oh you got to that's not
*  I'm saying you you have to but nobody is thinking about that. Like everybody everybody is like so afraid
*  Kobe to Kobe Kobe, but I personally think that you should be more afraid of catching a cold and the flu didn't get in Kobe
*  19 I think you should be afraid of kovat 19, but you should also be afraid of catching the flu, right?
*  Those all that's bad all that's bad, you know, it's not good to be sick
*  But when you when you protect your immune system and keep your body healthy and strong it it definitely
*  It's like you have troops. All right, you got to think of the virus is like an invading army
*  Why does all these viruses and apparently that Lex Friedman quote?
*  What was it? How many different viruses are there hundreds of thousands that are constantly competing?
*  Like he was describing it this is this genius Russian scientists that I have on the
*  Specifically the kovat virus. We're talking about all of ours in general
*  He says it's like a world war out there viruses
*  But what I hear in and when it comes to it being a world war I've heard that here's Kobe
*  I'm this guy wrote there's three hundred twenty thousand plus distinct viruses and mammals and a hundred million
*  Invertebrates invertebrates and plants there's an epic microscopic world war going on
*  All around us and inside us nature is beautiful and terrifying and then so why is this?
*  Why is this one getting the headlines? Well, that's the case
*  It's called it's a novel coronavirus meaning. No one has an immune system for it
*  No one has developed immunity, you know when you think about other diseases like the common cold or you know
*  Different flus like we've had flus people have a certain amount of immunity to flu you get flu shots
*  You can get a flu shot. It gives you an immunity to a certain amount
*  Even even when they get the flu shot wrong apparently because sometimes they they guess the wrong flu strain
*  It still has enough of what a flu is to protect you somewhat
*  So to keep you from getting more so Corona is actually a strand of it's like the baby brother of the flu
*  Not really. It's a it's a type of virus a coronavirus is a is a whole category of viruses that includes the common cold
*  This is they call it SARS 2 or COVID
*  19 and this is a new one
*  So then the problem with this is no one knows how it gets spread like even back as far as January
*  They were thinking it didn't spread through the air. They were thinking
*  And I know this might be some ignorant questions, but I know
*  Like none of us really know it's it's we're learning so
*  is that with the
*  Like you said, I think what people are fearful of the most if it's airborne. Yes
*  I mean, I don't know if that is the specific reason why they're enforcing wearing masks or whatever
*  Yes, and I don't know if we've got to that panic stage
*  I know none of the people have announced it or anything
*  But it hasn't it hasn't been classified as a virus that's airborne like it doesn't just fly around
*  motherfucking
*  Fly around shit all day
*  Well when a virus is airborne what it means is like when you sneeze or you cough or you you know
*  Breathe on someone there's moisture that's going through your mouth and into the air and it's spreading
*  It's traveling a certain amount of distance. That's how things are airborne
*  It's not like they're just flying around it's they're coming out of people and they're getting in other people
*  So the average space a motherfucker can spit some shit at six feet before it can affect you
*  There's a lot of theories. Some people think it could be as much as 13 feet. Yeah, they don't know it's all guesswork
*  It's all guesswork
*  They're learning as they go along how far but they do know it travels through the air
*  they definitely know that there was a really sad story about a choir that got together and
*  I don't know. I don't know. They didn't say
*  I don't know how many people that a choir a couple people died because they were all singing together
*  And when you're singing together, you're raising your voice you're projecting so probably filling the air right with all this stuff
*  you know, I just
*  it's just interesting man because
*  you like
*  Everybody all you hear people say is like I can't wait for it to get back to normal again
*  I can't wear it people like people and I think that people are
*  Want to have enough confidence in the government or Donald Trump for Donald? I think some people are just waiting for him to say, okay
*  We're good. It's over and that's not gonna be the case. No, it'll never be like
*  Charlemagne posted something
*  And was it a booty picture
*  The booty picture was the picture we have kiss the tongue kiss him a league yobas
*  Did you go to the show?
*  No, you can't bring that name up around me said yes. Love each other. Oh my god booty booty booty
*  Can you do this? This was a boot beauty booty music at least said you just started a fucking fight. I
*  Didn't I didn't what he posted? Oh my god, and his name is Lenard Joe. Okay. Charlemagne is a great name
*  Yeah, but the guy part is the thing I would never connect with oh, yeah
*  Yeah, that that's well he can get away with it somehow Lenard even says that if you go to his Instagram
*  There's something he posted about Spanish flu. Why you ain't go to the one I posted about here
*  Oh, oh, that's my but go ahead and Spanish flu. Go ahead
*  No, it's a is it's a photograph I think
*  Damn it my wrong. I was pretty sure what about that with a Charlemagne?
*  What about
*  Now that's the one you know, I don't know that Charlemagne. I know that motherfucker with them yellow Richard Simmons booty
*  And I promise I won't interrupt it I know no I'm just saying Joe
*  I know you guys I'm trying my hardest not to interrupt man, but I can't stay in them booty shows, but go ahead. I'm sorry
*  Go ahead, maybe it wasn't his I saw I swore I did not bring I swear I did not bring this up
*  You set me up I would never do that I would never do that I only did it because he so whoever I thought it was
*  Him someone posted maybe did it on Twitter
*  I don't know someone posted something that was a picture of these people that got tired of social distancing after the
*  1918 flu and they were out in the streets celebrating the end of the war and they said that that started a
*  Resurgence in cases and the second wave wound up killing more people than died in the war
*  You know who those people were?
*  Young men a lot of no they were motherfuckers. It was a fucked up relationships
*  Joe if Corona don't has anything
*  Yo, if Corona don't test anything is gonna test the love that you have for the person that you supposed to love
*  Yes, and I'm pretty sure like nobody wants to die, right? Right. Definitely. Nobody wants to die, right?
*  But sometime I'm addicted to bitches that you know what?
*  Huh, you finding out I made a mistake
*  Mistake, but you start and I hope this is not the case with people you start weighing it
*  Oh, yeah, oh fuck man. I swear well women with men to men
*  Imagine being living with a guy who's falling apart right now fall apart and the health wiles are just no in their life
*  Just like if you're together you're together in a house 24-7
*  right and you know, you're you're falling apart as far as
*  Like the way you're handling this like some people just can just accept okay, this is a new normal
*  There's what there's a lot of people running around like this open the fucking cover me back up
*  There's people that are freaking out right now
*  Right and there's people that have points and there's people that don't have points but men and women like everybody's a mess right now
*  You know you you're absolutely right and this is where and I know you've got it. You're a fan of David
*  You know, I'm saying love him David and David Goggins. Oh love him
*  Like like I agree with you like you have different mindsets with something like this happened
*  Yeah, you have the mindset of like oh fuck. What am I gonna do? How am I gonna get money fuck?
*  Oh my god, I only can survive off for one week somebody please help me
*  You got that motherfucker the bitch motherfucker. Then you got a motherfucker that's calm and says, okay
*  There will be some challenges
*  I'm not I'm not sure where the next money's gonna come from
*  But I can't just sit there and bitch about I got to do something about it
*  You gotta do something like you say and one of the things that this is gonna what's gonna happen with this?
*  It's gonna be it's gonna increase awareness on so many fucking levels because they do these Covey fucking um
*  Briefs every day right and there's three things they say it's gonna really fuck you up if you do
*  Drugs alcohol and it's another one drugs obesity drugs and alcohol
*  Obesity was the number one factor in New York City
*  This what you this is what they don't report and I'm not just I'm not shitting on anybody, you know, do God bless
*  I mean, hopefully nobody I know gets it or just I don't want shit to happen anyway
*  But this is what they don't mention when they say these numbers, you know, and it's crazy. I ain't trying to be asshole of
*  500 people died today. They don't break it down. Is it 500 Joe Rogan niggas?
*  Is it 500 David Goggins niggas? No, it's probably it's
*  You know what it is. It is but sometimes it's not that's what's scary about that
*  I know sometime is not but we do know Joe did it contributes. Yes. It has a major factor
*  It's a major factor and people need to know that it's a major factor and stop saving their feelings
*  Yes, letting them know as a fact. Yeah, so some other motherfuckers is dying to Kovie
*  Yes, and sometimes like when you're just
*  This nigga was live with a ventilator, right he sound like biggie small so he was like
*  Y'all know it's a serious nigga. Yes, it's serious
*  You know what else is serious to those ten pieces of chicken that extra sweet tea
*  That motherfucking potato salad with mayonnaise and mayonnaise and mayonnaise and mayonnaise all that shit is important. All of it is relevant
*  All of its role all of it is fucking relevant you it's delicious food
*  But you know what you're doing when you're eating it when I talk when you drink something
*  That's like, you know why you're drinking it like if you drink it like a regular coca-cola, right? It's goddamn delicious
*  But you know, you're gonna pay for you know what you're doing though. It's like fram oil filters
*  You can pay me now or you can pay me later
*  That's the one of my shop teachers used to tell that tell me that all the time
*  Like I was a fuck up in school, right and he'd be like Don L
*  I'd be fucked and be like Don L listen my lessons are like
*  Fram oil filters you can pay me now or you can pay me later
*  I was young and dumb when you young and dumb you don't know what wisdom is you like this old motherfucker need to shut the
*  Fuck up. I didn't know what he meant until that's those lessons. He tried to teach me then
*  As I got older I was like now and I know the fuck he's talking about
*  You could pay me two dollars for this elf air filter now or three thousand for a whole new transmission, right?
*  You know I'm saying and people don't people don't people don't understand that
*  That's a way of looking at it for sure
*  the but with the the problem with people's bodies and like what they put into them is they
*  Get this connection in their head that this is rewarding them that food is rewarding that sugar. Yeah, right sugar
*  It's a trap. It's sugar and it's carbohydrates. We've been trapped for so long
*  Well, no, no more than you black people you go to any black person house
*  You're gonna have sugar in the cabinet and salt right you go to a white person house. You have oregano
*  You have time you have rosemary and shit. I where the fuck is the sugars? Where's the salts? Well, you cook right?
*  Yeah, I do. Do you do you like are you big in the spices?
*  I know my spices
*  But one of the things that I'm trying to do and not like Heather B because Heather B is a good friend of mine
*  Right, and she just everything is fried right what I want to do and I get impressed. It's trying to cook cleaner
*  And for a black person telling the black person to eat clean. It's like that shit nasty
*  Do you know your health work done? Do you get like blood work done to see? Yeah
*  I know don't know where my kovie shit is right now. They're gonna come here
*  Who's gonna administer is it gonna be is it gonna be a nurse Charlemagne
*  And I and I want to know and that's another thing that's like
*  that's a
*  Drawback of this whole process like who has access to a test
*  You know, you know I mean like who has access to a test there's a whole line outside if you go
*  There's like a well a bunch of these stations
*  They've set up all around the valley where you can pull in and they'll they'll give you a test
*  But is that is that something is that something that?
*  The government's paying for is part of your insurance. No, it's good question. Jamie. Do you know?
*  The one before you need like a doctor's prescription, but eventually they're gonna have to be able to eventually
*  It's gonna have to be it should be accessible to everybody should be free
*  Right should be look if we're gonna spend money on anything we should spend money on that right?
*  God damn like the idea that I'm gonna make people pay for that. You can't crazy. Yeah, you can't this is the thing
*  That's happening right now. It's almost like
*  that there's a lot of dangerous shit that happens when things go into chaos because there's people that take advantage of those moments and
*  They use rich the people get rich
*  But more importantly laws get passed because people are scared
*  And those laws can like be they could sneak something in where they ban encryption or they sneak something in where they stop
*  Digital currencies that aren't controlled by a certain certain companies
*  They can sneak weird shit in while people are freaking out 24-hour surveillance because we want to make sure that people don't loot and riot
*  That weird shit can happen that can erode your civil liberties when things get chaotic different change. This is a weird time
*  You know, but this is where we live. This is life right now
*  Do you think something like this had to happen?
*  For people to put real family values and what's important in perspective?
*  Is it do you believe like we talked about it off like and I'm like, um
*  I'm a religious person to the extent that I know that it is something that makes people feel good about
*  Yeah, you know, but you know with and but then you have those holy holy holy people that celebrate God
*  On one level but then when something like this happened
*  They don't understand that if you believe that God can fix anything is going to take you to the promised land
*  You got to believe that he had to be part of the narrative of this of this curse
*  I think it's how much responsibility you put on yourself and how much responsibility even if you believe in God you put on that
*  Like you got to do some work yourself too
*  Like even if you believe in God don't get so fat that you're gonna die. You got it. Yeah, don't do that
*  Don't let yourself do that start drinking water. Just exercise stopped eating as much sugar
*  You can do it Joe motherfuckers all the fucking time
*  You got a fucking help God help them. You got to help them. You can't you can't just be like, oh shit guy
*  I hope I don't get diabetes. Let me get the cotton candy. Let me get the extra sweet tea. Let me get the funnel cake
*  You can't do that
*  Right, you're right. You can't shouldn't if you do you're you're you're doing a disservice to the gift of life
*  You know many people out there in wheelchairs they're born with horrible debilitating diseases
*  They can't do shit people have been in accidents people that have been blown up in war
*  They can't even move around and here you are taking a perfectly good body
*  And just dump and bullshit into it while it just explodes and I understand that people get addicted to things you get addicted to that
*  Feeling of the rush of eating but you got to get yourself off of it
*  You know, it's not a way to live your life better. It can be done other people have done it
*  To
*  You're gonna be you and I it was I really enjoyed meeting RZA. He's a fascinating dude. I have a lot of respect for him
*  He's a genius is a really interesting guy, but it was funny to watch
*  I'm gonna take a funny thing about it and I haven't said this I was like this one
*  I'm gonna do rogue and people like what you gonna talk about like nigga
*  I'm just gonna talk about did I just I felt like we had so much to talk about right? Yeah, and I don't feel like I
*  Oh
*  Anybody and an apology or anything, but I would like to give an explanation
*  Please don't you're great. You're just being you
*  Don't try to tone it down people that you read hate you can't say they hated you there's so many people
*  I don't give a fuck about me. I know nobody cares about
*  I
*  Already got them in the bag, bro. Give a fuck. I love you. Fuck you. Who's an asshole?
*  You know, it was you can never you can never get to a zero point
*  You can never get to a no haters point. It doesn't exist. It doesn't exist. I just need to bring it down just a little bit
*  Cuz you said they weren't mad at you. This is how you some of them were mad
*  A lot of them were mad you're reading too many of the comments and you did when we left and this was this was
*  Before Kobe 19 when we would embrace when I see you I hug and the funny the irony of that interview
*  Was at the end of it you and I were feeling good about it. I love yo, I loved it. Listen, bro
*  I loved it like a motherfucker side damn it tongue kiss you pause. No, Charlamagne. No Charlamagne
*  Yo, you embrace me cuz you said I remember what you said you said at the end of it
*  cuz that's when RZA did the freestyle or whatever and you said and
*  Hearing you say this means a lot you said that might be one of the greatest
*  Outro's in podcast history a hundred percent coming from a motherfucker. That's 1200 plus you just seen it all right?
*  And I was like you right and we hugged and I do remember you telling me this too. Don't read the comments, right?
*  I'm hard-headed son. I'm hard-headed son
*  Ride or die and I'm looking at you like what the fuck do you mean Joe? The streets love me
*  The streets love me man, I had a good run and I
*  Let me tell you some joke you said don't read the comments. I know this might be excessive, but I think I only read
*  2782 oh my god, and it was nice
*  It was nice and then they started using words did only the vocabulary of a real podcaster cringe
*  Like what words word cringe? Oh cringe just straight cringe. Like I need a little bit more information
*  What the fuck is your definition of cringe? They was like cringe
*  Muffucker said and this is the real assholes. They didn't want anybody get to know me anything
*  They was telling people exactly where on the timeline
*  to find the
*  Disgust they had they'd be like I almost fucking killed myself at 1738
*  Okay, kid a motherfucking get 16 minutes before we get done now. I'm telling you you can't pay attention to that
*  Yo, you just gotta be you you're great you're sorry Joe Joe that's easy for you to say Joe
*  Yo, how many years it take you to just be you and comfortable like this and the reason I'm saying that when you first started
*  Right when you and after that in the birth of my podcast because when you first started
*  I know as calm as your demeanor is right now and as comfortable and I may be wrong as comfortable of
*  Saying fuck them. Don't worry about them
*  I know that could not have been your beginning. I
*  You had to have had
*  You and I may be wrong you had to like, okay. Why did that person say that? What do they mean by that?
*  Don't know. I think I have brain damage from what from getting hit in the head
*  And I don't think I worry about this same things that people worry about right? You're absolutely right cuz I thought that's a real possibility
*  Right, you know me that might be real right there might be something going on there, but it's also
*  I
*  Saw your whole career money, and I just wanted to stand up there was free
*  Okay, so you had see you had a I'm not a I don't buy a lot of shit. I don't I don't go crazy
*  I like cars. That's my only addiction, but I'm not when I did something like fear factor and making some money
*  It gave me this freedom to now just not worry about ever doing that. You always have been of that mindset
*  Yeah, but it reinforced it. It's just
*  Things like that reinforce it like having a
*  Having like savings in the bank is nice
*  But also doing what you want to do is nice to one of the things that I learned from fear factor
*  I'm gonna tell you I don't want to do that anymore. I don't want to do that kind of stuff anymore
*  You know what I don't want to be premature of it, but I can see you my podcast mentor
*  You know I'm saying but not being but you
*  I
*  Into it too early, but you made me feel that type of confidence in term and in terms of
*  controlling your own destiny being in control of your own shit, and this is what you want to do because I've talked to you about
*  Every time I get idea here. We think about this. It's a TV show and you told me like I was excited about this idea
*  And you were like the podcast brought you control that you don't want you're you right?
*  Like you're you at your best when you're just having fun being you and no one's gonna allow you to do that
*  Producers are gonna get greasy
*  They're gonna get their greasy hands on you and they're gonna try to do this or get you to wear that or don't talk about
*  This a don elf you could just lay back here and just let there's a bunch of people directing you
*  You're not gonna get to who you really are right you gotta do it by yourself and also find that I don't try to interview
*  You in your own show, but where did you wait? Where'd you when did you feel that?
*  I just knew that because I saw Tom Green interview you did yeah
*  And and this was like I don't know if this was considered the birth because this wouldn't technology the whole thing and you were like
*  Breaking it it was weird for me to hear you breaking down the future of it
*  Yeah to somebody that was actually doing it and you said you said you got to figure out
*  This is important. How do you make money off? How do you make money off it? Yeah?
*  But you also got to keep it the way it is where no one's fucking with it when I went to Tom Green's house
*  He just had these wires like this is 2007
*  He was lot any that was dial-up not only was it no people had cable and they had ISDN lines and 2007
*  It's like there's mostly a lot of people at cable
*  It wasn't the near the bandwidth that you got now
*  But he had all the servers and everything in his house
*  He had turned his house he had this dope house in the hills and he had turned this house into a TV studio his living
*  Room wasn't a living room anymore. It had a desk and had monitors behind it and all this was like these big fat fucking cables
*  So that was a show after Canada to connect
*  He did this all on his own and I had actually met with the company
*  I met them in the Denver Comedy Works and talked to them a little bit about doing something similar
*  But I was like my thought was like as soon as you start doing it with a company now
*  You're now you're doing the same thing again. You don't want them to do
*  You're just doing it online you just different kinds of people and it's not it's not a value judgment
*  But there's different kinds of people there's wild
*  Creative people and then there's studio executives studio executives are the people that have to look at these wild creative people and go
*  How do I make sure that Donald doesn't go crazy? I'm gonna put him on this show
*  It's too wild we gotta bring him down
*  Too much we gotta we gotta keep him on the commercials have to come in seven minutes
*  He has to be ready to make that break
*  They'll and they'll don't say look we've got numbers done
*  Now that shows when you start talking about this people get upset and they turn off, right?
*  But if you just you know talk about this we're better
*  So we've wrote you some talking points and they'll bring you some shit look we're not writing for you
*  We're just giving you some you like what the fuck is this?
*  But I do need the money and then you have to have a meeting and Debbie's gonna pull you into the office and go down
*  I just don't think you respect me. Okay, we have to work together. I'm your executive producer
*  You know, I'm here to put this show together
*  You have to work with me and I don't want to I would love to work with you
*  But I don't want to cuz you don't respect the fact that I that you don't respect what I'm doing
*  So how the fuck do you get to respect the wild creative people?
*  It doesn't always work out like sometimes they don't
*  Doesn't pan out a podcast doesn't panel or a TV shoot doesn't pan out
*  But at least you they have a chance right like you can't have a podcast like
*  Yours yours is a perfect example. You're just you right?
*  You just a lot of it is just you ranting into the camera about shit
*  You can't no one would ever let you do it that way and let us build an organic. That's why and that's why
*  When you were trying to tell me the beauty of it
*  I wasn't understanding because another reason I wanted to I was like, all right motherfucker
*  When do the money kick in you know I'm saying like I understand that you was like, yeah Donny
*  It was gonna be one. I was like this. All right, what number do I hit when I start?
*  Genuinely, they say it's like when you start getting I think it's like a hundred thousand downloads, right? That's when
*  Advertisers become interested in you because that's legitimate. That's a hundred thousand people and as long as you pick your products carefully
*  I definitely did good man right now
*  Come dick pills mine was the flesh light was the first one flashlight flesh light
*  What's the flesh like the flesh light is a fake pussy that comes
*  And I want y'all to pay me for that one right now, let's do some fucking business
*  I'll do some business with you. I bet if they still do podcasts do they do anymore?
*  Well, that's how I met my friend Aubrey when we started on it together. He was

*  It's the same shit. It's the same thing as a white man's air freshener. It's the same shape
*  It's the black last matter of air fresheners joe. It is hilarious though. They pretend look
*  It's like a tree made out of chemicals, but joe, oh, it's like the woods joe
*  I don't want to distract but getting back to the candle. Um, this is the donnie ross candle, right?
*  And I want to handle yeah. All right, check it out
*  And one of my um, whitney whitney comings has one angela ye had one

*  It smells see that's another thing this is a this this candle helps you during corona
*  Like you burn that candle and the minute you don't smell it nigga go get a test
*  But more importantly joe more importantly joe it's could you read the description?
*  Could you read the description and the ingredients in it this shit back here? Yes, sir. Get your glasses, man
*  I have it on the screen if you can get that better. Yeah, much better. There you go
*  Uh from marcy projects to hollywood donnell captured six true smells oils
*  Going from ashy to classy breathe in the memories of cold air hitting your skin on a winter's day
*  Shades of your skin getting ashier and ashier as the brisk wind hit your arms and ankles
*  Captured the energy of a good lotion without having it black ash eliminates the smell of twerk
*  And replaces it with his exotic smells the ingredients joe
*  Uh, I don't know the first one. What is that bergamot bergamot?
*  I don't know what that is. You know what that is. Jamie bergamot. We don't sandalwood. I've heard of that musk. Uh-huh elon
*  lavender jasmine and
*  amber
*  Ambergris ambergris ambergris
*  Ambergris, do you know what that is? And this okay ambergris? This is where um,
*  Because I have a really professional person that does these candles, right?
*  Ambergris and I was talking to somebody that's really a health nut into raw stuff ambergris
*  This is what I heard ambergris was at first. It was sperm
*  From a whale I knew you were getting excited about this even I thought about it
*  This is what I heard first. It was sperm from a whale that they mined for it, right?
*  But come to find out it wasn't I thought it was I was like, oh shit my candle got a
*  Whale nut, right? But it's not that it's the byproduct of an actual sperm whale
*  Do you know when you see no cruelty no cruelty?
*  That's the most important the load out of the whale without being cool. See that's when the story started to start
*  That's when the story got flaky. You know, I mean I needed to know more. I was like who was jerking the whale 60 000
*  What? Yeah, you fucking pop-up ads you son of a bitch
*  What is it?
*  Oh, you have to give them an email
*  Oh shut up. I know you got somewhere else on it because I was gonna say is that red bull
*  We found out that red bulls made with taurine and the original source of taurine. They used to get it from bull testicles
*  Really? Bull nuts. Yeah, like hitler apparently was into taurine
*  Bull nuts. Yeah. Yeah, it's like some form of testosterone or something or some form of stimulant
*  Why anything that has something to do with sperm?
*  It feels like it's supposed to give you soup the super strength or something people are silly
*  Ambergris how to tell if you struck gold with the whale vomit
*  Or stumbled upon sewage. Oh, so sometimes you they find it like floating around. Yeah
*  Oh, is it now?
*  The first thought I thought it was sperm. So I was like who the fuck is swimming through? Oh my god
*  Look at that shit
*  It it can be up to seventy one thousand dollars for a 1.57 kilogram lump. That's like three
*  Three and a half pounds right something like that. And it's saliva. What is the whale? What what is it the whale?
*  It said whale vomit. So it's like truffle. Yes. Look I knew it
*  I knew it's compared to fucking truffles
*  My shit my candle got truffle ish type fucking ambergris. It's a product of the sperm whale
*  That's what it is. Scroll back up a little bit there. Jimmy and there's no cruelty. Nobody beats shit out the whale
*  It's not whale sperm. It's a product of the sperm whale
*  Only a sperm whale makes the compound responsible for ambergris allure. It's called ambrene
*  And different organisms biosynthesize different compounds such as caffeine made by cocoa coffee or tea plants
*  Ambreen is made by sperm whales only to glue together squid beaks. What the fuck?
*  So what you saying now joe is my candle is baller is shit man
*  Look at listen the rest of it listen the rest of his squid is the main diet of sperm whales, but the beaks can't be digested
*  They need to be passed out without causing injury and they do this by coating them with ambergrin
*  So the sperm whale creates this amazing shit just to dissolve beaks of squids
*  Or to be in my fucking candle god damn nature's and to be in my fucking candle
*  And to say all that off my black ash
*  But the thing is it's some quality shit in there joe
*  And the thing about it was it was I was going to launch this before the corona shit hit
*  But I had to ask myself like
*  This would put things in perspective for me. I'm a road rat. You know, i'm a road dog
*  Yeah, when you're a road dog, you start feeling company like I got you look at your candle
*  a comedian you look at your calendar
*  And see your calendar you like i'm good and the rhythm of my calendar
*  Before this shit popped I was rocking with martin
*  We had fucking dates coming on
*  You know what i'm saying? I had some yeah, I was looking for some good shit
*  New orleans, we were in nashville new orleans. I had one time where I was supposed to do you this was going to be my weekend
*  It was you and dave on a friday and then martin lawrence the next day
*  As they say in the streets god was good as a motherfucker
*  The last show I did before these mandates came in it was at the um at the milwau you probably played it before milwaukee theater
*  Yeah, the paps the paps theater. Yeah, so you've been down in the green room downstairs, right? Incredible. That was the last time
*  It was the last time I was on stage. Do you remember what weekend that was?
*  It's at the 14th
*  Or was it the weekend before that?
*  There was like a couple of weekends where people were still like I remember post malone had a big show
*  It was right when it was about the pop it was like, you know the reason why because seeing a daze road guy, whatever
*  Every like when we were on the road every day was a different news report
*  You know what i'm saying? It was right when it was going down joe like it was like where everybody was celebrating
*  Yeah, it was everybody was like oh fucking uh, this is what we was hearing the nba
*  Baseball and we was like this. We're good. We're telling jokes
*  The next thing you know the shit was shut down, but I said
*  I was like hold up motherfucker. You are really
*  unemployed right now
*  You know and when I say that
*  My flow of income is road and i'm like, what do you do? You got savings and shit
*  But you still nobody wants to just see money
*  Going out and no money coming in
*  And then I was like I was happy that this is why I was I could tell you I always thank you
*  But I was happy because you got me out the gate
*  So the momentum is there and I needed to put the focus in I was forced to put the focus in it
*  But I put the focus on and I said myself as all these comedians bitch what i'm gonna do
*  I'm like you got three months
*  To figure out what your rhythm is going to be and what you're going to do
*  You can wait for this shit is what you ever you consider to be over
*  You can wait for it's over and then like start now or you can start now
*  And the only reason i'm saying like that the candle thing it was going to be a novelty thing whatever
*  But I was like this candle is gonna gonna train me on
*  What it takes to come up with an idea?
*  Market it get people excited about it provide a quality product and see what the feedback is, you know
*  So I know it may seem like so simple to people but as i've always had a uh,
*  Entrepreneur spirit but never was forced to really engage it. Yeah. Well, you know you only have so much time, right?
*  That's it we're doing stand-up constantly and you're always on the road
*  There's only so much time to do other things and the worry is that if you do try to do other things that those things
*  Would take time away from your stand-up. That's what every comic worries, but I was a road rat
*  Yeah, so and I talked to you before it starts somebody said every time I do an interview
*  first thing people like oh it must be because
*  We're on the stage you and I are
*  We do this shit
*  You know i'm saying we don't just okay, I got an arena tour coming up. All right, i'm gonna take two weeks
*  I'm gonna yo yo, i'm terrifying that would be yo i'm gonna tape and look i'm gonna tape an hour special
*  I got one week to prepare for it and you see it. It's reflective of the show
*  You can we're not deaf people. No, we straight up
*  monday
*  tuesday
*  wednesday
*  You know you probably not so you you do clubs anymore. I do all the clubs
*  Like do you like do you go out and hit like a yeah, I still do I like to I like to do
*  Comedy works in denver. So you know what those reps those reps are that's what that and now you like for that person
*  it's just like
*  Everything we express and we's part of what we do it because it's somewhat about therapy
*  You know i'm saying you angry or something. Let me go fucking talk about it. You're happy about something. Let me go fucking talk about it
*  you know like
*  So people like that when it's time when it's when it's time to put up you you you fucking ready to do it
*  You know, I mean you're working out. Yeah, you have to it's just we've all tried stand up different ways
*  You know, there's been comedians since the beginning of stand up trying it different ways and pretty much everybody agrees
*  You got to do it constantly and that's and i'll always lose my thought this is where I start to interrupt
*  But the question that I had to bring my back and i'm learning to be better at this
*  As people always ask one of these interviews they say oh and I was this was a follow-up on us how we love performing
*  They say oh man
*  It's got to be fucking killing you
*  to not be able to get on stage
*  and if uh
*  If I didn't have my son
*  Like the thing now is i'm replacing stage time with dad time
*  And it doesn't affect me as much you know i'm saying it doesn't like oh I gotta get out
*  Because the time I was like, okay, I got to do three spots tonight i'm watching onward with my son
*  I'm building a goddamn fucking
*  Uh, uh a fake candy machine out of cardboard
*  So it's the transition for me hasn't been that tough because I just put that energy somewhere else and it's been
*  Amazing fine. My son's four years old joe
*  This is the longest stretch of time i've spent with him since he was born
*  and not because i'm a neglectful dad or anything because
*  You got shows
*  And it put things in perspective because at one point when I was like I can't miss this show fuck that you gotta go
*  Get the money got to get the money now that i'm getting this time with my son
*  uh
*  Going back out or whatever i'm like this. You know what?
*  Maybe I just should start considering counseling that weekend
*  You know you could do things around here, too
*  You know what i'm doing i've been thinking a lot about that about almost like doing like a la residency like find a place
*  It's like a 500 seat theater or something like that. This is what this is the this is the beauty of covey
*  If there's anything it makes you think on a different level what makes you think that this is really temporary
*  Just because it's always been there doesn't mean it will always be there what you mean the virus or anything
*  Whatever life is right the way our society is structured. This is new, right?
*  There's the cities themselves are new. They've only they've only been around here for a few hundred years, right?
*  We pretend all my friends think we the world started in the 60s
*  Whatever it is
*  Whatever the date is we all know that the world used to be very different
*  We just assume that the way it is now is the way it's going to stay
*  That's not a good assumption because it's all volatile and changes constantly and there's natural disasters that are way scarier than this virus
*  There's things like asteroid impacts that are inevitable. There's things like super volcanoes, which are inevitable
*  They're going to happen whether they happen a hundred thousand years from now or a hundred days from now
*  Somewhere in the world a giant volcano is going to explode and it's going to turn the whole fucking planet into nuclear winter
*  And a lot of shit is going to die. It's going to cloud out the sun
*  It's going to cool the temperature of the planet and it's going to do it for years and a lot of fucking things are going to die
*  That's happened a ton of times
*  Of that. I mean this what we're having right now is people are conditioned to it because they went through it
*  We never went through exactly but this is why we're going through something that is the good
*  If there's anything that's good about going through something is that you're forced to realize that something can happen something real can happen
*  That shuts the world's economy down and no one saw it coming something real. That's a real thing
*  But we really haven't had in america. We really haven't had that test
*  No, but this is for the whole world though
*  This is like a planetary test and the good thing about that is you get to see how different people try it different people
*  Have different, you know strategies they have to deal with their public and their their health care
*  And it's very different results all over the planet and they're going to analyze all that shit and try to find out why
*  Germany did so well and italy did so bad and this and that they're going to try to put all this stuff together
*  It's it's a it's a terrible time for the people that are affecting the people to get sick
*  But there's no there's no it's not a good thing
*  Do you think but people can get something good out of it?
*  You can get something good out of a bad thing and the good thing is to prepare yourself better
*  You know, I agree with you 100%
*  But do you think this because when you you talk about it, you know only motherfucker I would know
*  There were no more than 10 viruses most motherfuckers. I grew up with only know one virus
*  You know, you know all the viruses do you think and when I know all the virus, you know, you know more viruses than me
*  You know, I barely know what i'm talking about. Yeah, but it sounds good because i'm repeating
*  But you read off them 10 syllable words like you know, all the motherfucking viruses mother you didn't have to clap it out
*  But they say this is what they say about the virus, too
*  This is what they say about the virus too joe they say it's a bitch ass virus. Yeah, like they like
*  Is it for some people for some people do you think and i've heard that?
*  Will you think it'll be?
*  Flattening more or when it starts getting really really hot
*  I don't know you think because I heard it doesn't survive like 85 degree or 90 degree temperature
*  This is what i've read somewhere that it doesn't have the the likelihood of it living out of your body
*  Whatever is a lot shorter. Yeah, I don't know if that's true
*  But I do know that for whatever reason there are seasons right where people get colds
*  I mean it kind of makes sense. Yeah, because it wouldn't be on surfaces as long like that's why you
*  You hear somebody that have a cold in the summer. You're like, whoa
*  Yeah, you okay? Because those viruses them flu viruses and them corona virus. That's like some cold shit
*  Yeah, I don't know enough to comment on that, but I do know that their words is going to be a second wave
*  The word is going to be a first wave and then people are going to relax and there's going to be a second wave
*  So it'll be a second wave of people have to if people build too much confidence
*  It's definitely going to be a second wave. What's weird to me is how some people get it and it's nothing
*  They don't even they they just uh, I had a cough for a couple days. I can't believe I had that a person close to
*  Mind that works in my camp. I want his name or whatever right person goes this motherfucker had corona light
*  Yo, I noticed I had to be funny true this motherfucker said
*  I talked to that hurt. He said he heard he had corona. I was like, oh, I got corona
*  I was all fucked up, right?
*  I was like, oh shit, like all this shit, right?
*  And then the motherfucker said he was home like three days later. I'm like what fucking type of corona you got
*  So he's at the hospital for three days. Yeah, it was a hospital for three days
*  If you're in the hospital for three days, it means you got it bad
*  Michael Michael motherfucking Michael yo Michael yo and the weird thing about the Michael yo joint because like
*  Um, I love Michael yo, he's such a great dude. He's a great guy. Yo, joe. He's a great guy
*  So I was up early every morning four four thirty. I'm up early right and certain people are up like five o'clock hit
*  um
*  I posted something and yo liked it, which is okay normal of him and then he comment. I was like, oh motherfucker you up
*  Right. I'm like you want to comment you up you could you could like in your sleep, right? Right, but to comment
*  You can just automatic like oh how many I owe this motherfucker like blah blah blah comment is like okay
*  Put the glasses on right? So this is when I was up the notion. I was like
*  motherfuckers
*  Um the shit that's so fucked about this pandemic is that motherfuckers are afraid to die
*  And then I said and this was this was my mind when I was like
*  Only time motherfuckers really think about living is when they think they're going to die
*  That's when when someone what the doctor says well, how long does he have to live?
*  Three years their mother fucker want to do everything they want to see their parents more
*  They want to fucking do they bucket list shit, you know i'm saying I was like that's his motherfuckers
*  They afraid to die and you got to know that it's inevitable that's going to happen to everybody
*  You know, so I would just I just wanted to rap when yo so I told him
*  I said man and I told him this whole shit. I said man
*  Motherfucker ain't trying to live and to a motherfucker is um, i'm thinking about dying and j Michael yo said
*  Nigga almost died, right?
*  And that moment was so meant so much to me for so many reasons joe to hear michael yo say the word niggas
*  That I got the same feelings when wayne brady said is wayne brady gonna have to smack a bitch
*  I was like my
*  Finally I was so happy. I was so happy because michael. Yo is one of the most unscathed motherfuckers, you know
*  This mother it's see like michael yo name should have been preston or something like that, right?
*  And then he told me what his situation was whatever and he's getting better. He announced it whatever but he got it bad
*  He got it real bad. He was in the hospital and he legitimately told me he thought he was dead to my point
*  As much as we want to consider it. That's all we hear the death of it the death
*  Yeah, so so die at 24 hours, but the thing about michael yo you have to really consider is that he's healthy
*  He's young exactly. He's robust like he's a guy works out a lot does a lot of lifting weights when you hear that
*  He got it and almost died. You're like, oh, well, this is a different thing. I'm thinking
*  I'm thinking not that much. I think he's fried chicken, too
*  No, yo, yo, don't let him twist you up that nigga ain't no health health health nut like that
*  No, just like said michael yo got half 50 50 nigga. You getting in touch with your black side or your asian side?
*  Which side did michael yo have corona in? Yeah, but he's the black side of his family
*  Then and he works out a lot like he's not he is not overweight at all and he lifts weights a lot
*  We talked about on the podcast. He goes to this like weightlifting gym. I know that place he goes to
*  It's like some it's just all weightlifting
*  I know you talk about and and he's a healthy guy. That's why when I say
*  The point i'm making is like, you know, it's not like this makes me sound crazy. Like when you back in a day
*  When you heard about AIDS
*  you
*  Didn't hear when it first popped
*  Nobody survived that shit. It's true nobody it was like you get a nigga for months
*  It's a wrap and everybody thought they had it and everybody thought they had but the reason why and it took some time
*  For it. Now, it doesn't have a cure but people are living with it. People when did you get tested?
*  When did you get tested? About four years ago. It's scary first time you got tested for no
*  No, the first time the first time was like
*  I got tested for an insurance thing that I had to do for health insurance like 92
*  92 some 92 ish and I was so terrified. Yeah, just a slideshow of all the terrible decisions
*  I've made the corona joint but the point I was making but when that first when that first hit
*  um
*  when that first hit motherfuckers was
*  Like it was like but people didn't really take it as serious because they just thought it was just associated with a certain lifestyle
*  Well, originally we thought anybody could get it. That's what they were really worried. They're worried that I mean this was remember
*  They when did they even start calling it hiv? Like in the beginning they were just calling it aids, right?
*  People worried about and you know, I think before that they even called it the gay cancer
*  Like they were trying to figure out what it was. It was killing people
*  But when I took uh my first test in 92, I remember all my friends were going through a similar situation
*  Everybody was terrified to take the test because we were all convinced that it had some incubation period
*  Right you could have it in your body and you'd be fine for five years six years
*  And it would it would kick in but the point the point i'm making about that is that
*  like um
*  but
*  Like you hearing you hear these stories of people like michael yoke
*  You hear this story about the person I was talking about early you hear people that when you heard they um
*  Gathered whatever that they made it through people are surviving it, you know some people. Yeah some people
*  Yeah, yeah, but that's what's weird about it man. It's killing some people that are young and apparently there's something called
*  That I never took any consideration
*  called viral load and this is uh
*  From the sperm well, well, it's nothing to do with it. What is how how exactly to define viral load?
*  So it depends like someone who works as a nurse in an er who deals with a lot of these patients is much more likely
*  To get it than someone just gets in contact with one person who has it. That's the constant being around
*  Yeah, the load I mean they're these these poor people that are working in health care right now
*  They're dealing with this constant environment of sickness and a lot of young nurses are dying
*  Yeah, that's the that's the um young doctors that is
*  So fucked up and it's so that's interesting because
*  You like, you know, we have the shortage of these masks and everybody's doing masks and stuff
*  And one of my friends was like I need a mask. I was like you better get a scarf do something, right?
*  It was like no I need to to m
*  94
*  3m so and so I'm like if you're walking if you walk down the street
*  With one of those fucking surgical doctor's masks to go to the fucking store
*  You should feel ashamed yourself because the doctors and nurses are the people that need that stash
*  The people that are out there on the front line are the ones that need that stash that's true
*  But in california, you have to wear those now in la you have to wear those when you're out
*  Yeah, you have to i'm talking about the level like the one i'm talking about is the one that
*  Oh, you mean that the real filter one the real filter one and I know that they like at first
*  It was all about everybody was like of the notion. You gotta have this certain mess, but then they said, you know
*  You have to cover yourself have to do it. They won't even let you into certain spots because of it. Yeah
*  Yeah, no you there's a new law in los angeles and los angeles when you're out you have to have your face covered
*  Which is like why don't you miss him? Man? That that is is that just is that just for going into businesses or just
*  precedent to set yes
*  Now people in the future like when are you going to tell them they can't cover their face anymore
*  This is where it gets weird because before
*  They're never going to say that they'll hold on before it was weird if you saw someone with their face covered
*  You would get nervous if they weren't asian they were trying to rob you
*  If they weren't asian imagine if you're a guy who works at a 24-hour convenience store and everybody's got a fucking face mask
*  Yeah, you know how much that guy's his tension has spiked. Your anxiety is spiked. Everyone could potentially rob him
*  You're not gonna believe this late night shift. You're not gonna believe that's why I got a see-through mask, you know
*  Child of motherfuckers you want to get back to really racial profiling? All right
*  But you're right that has to make people work in a liquor store and yeah, like you're you're
*  Your liquor store has been robbed a couple times already. I'm first off if I were here's the deal liquor store
*  Anybody's thinking about rob licks or keep in mind?
*  That i'm almost
*  Certain that every motherfucker that owned a liquor store got a shotgun or a pistol back there
*  Yeah, I don't give a fuck they're gonna have something back there
*  So you can roll up in there with your fucking spider-man mask if you want to you're gonna get your head split
*  That's a crazy job to be in man put yourself in a situation where every day you go at work
*  You might have a gun stuck in your face and be told to empty out the cash register like any day
*  Like you're living fear that the people coming in might rob you
*  I said I was at I have a routine
*  I don't socialize, but I go out get coffee, right? It's a 7-eleven. I go to
*  and um
*  I know the motherfucking mexican motherfucker that work in there, right and I was outside the car
*  And it was a black guy in here
*  And I could tell him this guy was looking at black guy next thing
*  You know, I was about to do a radio interview for dc my man joe clare shout out
*  And these motherfuckers started rumbling like fighting
*  Like going at it like pop pop pop fuck you fuck you
*  and my instinct was to
*  Try to go help or do something
*  And for a second, I was like, oh, this shit is fucked up man. Stop that then I was like
*  Rona out there motherfucker
*  I'm not getting it and they finally they stopped but it just it was just weird like that kind of contact
*  Yeah, unless you're stopping a man from doing that to a woman or unless you're stopping someone from hurting someone as much
*  This motherfucker worked for 7-eleven joe like he's defending whatever might have been a can of spam or whatever the situation is
*  Oh, that's what he's fighting over. I don't know what I don't know what it was
*  I'm pretty sure he's accused a guy shoplifting
*  But he put his especially in his day and age whatever and in the state the world is this motherfucker was fighting
*  He was fighting for this shit
*  Let it go. Yeah, you gotta let it go. I'm like this motherfucker. You can have especially because you're just an employee
*  Imagine having a fight for a can of spam, but that's just getting paid five dollars an hour anyway
*  In hawaii, what's what's minimum? It's like 11 bucks. No, no, it's it's over seven zero idea
*  They're trying to make it 15. I don't even know anybody that's making minimum wage. I know a few people I bet
*  It's like 11 dollars. I think it's like 11 or 12 bucks. Yeah
*  Yeah
*  Yeah, imagine fighting someone for 11 or 12 bucks an hour. They will fighting to the death if they're mexican they will
*  yo
*  You can start a new league, right?
*  Yo, you can try to find a home depot mma match
*  Them dudes will fight mask free. They don't give a fuck. That's hilarious
*  Yeah, but I was just like this goddamn what what are you loyal to this company?
*  Or are you loyal to the fact that you're in there protecting these seven level goods because you're providing money for your family
*  But i've said I was never said he doesn't even have a fucking security guard like the guy behind the counters gotta go
*  It was just what it was. It was one dude
*  One dude no, no, he couldn't jump they couldn't jump or anything was one fucking dude
*  Imagine being that dude that's in the sketchy area with the late nights the late night shift
*  And just sitting there looking out the window looking all these people you're in there like a little target man
*  I'm telling you I would be more fearful of that dude that's in that situation every day than a motherfucker just coming in here
*  Yeah, because he you know, he's played that scenario on his head forever. Probably has to oh they're gonna come in
*  I'm gonna I know they hit the button and everything
*  Yeah, dude a lot of people they they catch people slipping all the time
*  It's just those videos that you watch on youtube and you see someone get shot or you see someone get robbed like man
*  This is just a job
*  Just a terrible job and you're getting a gun put in your face think about getting actually robbed
*  That I was I used to live in brooklyn
*  And I used to live in this area called fort green clinton hills and it was in the right new
*  beginning of being um gentrified right spike lee used to have a um
*  House right down the street and I used to do a porch a comedy poetry night
*  Get a little money from the hat or whatever and one night i'm going to the weed spot
*  Right. I'm like fuck i'm gonna go get some weed
*  I go to the weed spot two motherfuckers roll up on me
*  And I knew I was in gentrified neighborhood because my hood sensors were down. I should have never been looking down
*  Two motherfuckers roll me. Give me a shit motherfucker. I'm like, oh shit
*  It was like where this motherfucker said where the jewelry because i'm not a flashy type of person
*  Where the jewel where the phone at motherfucker? I was like, I don't travel like that
*  I don't get down like that. This mother said are you a broke motherfucker?
*  You calling me broke
*  And you fucking robbing me
*  I'm like, what the fuck you somebody didn't raise you right?
*  That makes no sense
*  And I was still going to go to the weed spot because I still had a couple bucks in my pocket, right?
*  But I was like, it would be just my luck
*  I go to the weed spot and the same motherfucker that robbed me is in the goddamn weed spot. Yeah, but that shit was like
*  people and
*  And when it happened to me, I felt fucked up. I felt so violated because i'm like you a bitch
*  I would respect you more if you mug me
*  You're like beat me up for my money
*  But to pull a gun out and have that advantage and think you tough that shit was so fucked up and I felt so violated
*  On the inside
*  I was thinking
*  Like probably what most white dudes think you know what i'm gonna jump for the gun
*  Like you i'm thinking probably what you think i'm gonna disarm them
*  Because I know you got to move and somebody put I know you you know something
*  If somebody put a gun to you, you'll be like
*  And then next thing you know the gun bit bit in their face. I was thinking that shit, but I was like if I miss
*  People have a distorted idea what they can do
*  Especially if a guy's got a gun you you have a real distorted idea of how quickly you can move through space
*  Like all this person has to do is this
*  That's it. That's the great equalizer. It's a that's what the little movement like that a kid can kill you
*  And that's was the reason why I didn't go with how I felt on the inside you have to you know
*  Give them the money. It's just uh
*  Yeah, you're right. It's a it's a bitch way to do things
*  But it's just a it's a part of society that most people never use
*  Most people never pull a gun on people to get what they want, but some people do it's a real thing
*  And it's uh, it's a it's one of the weakest things someone can do
*  You know it is it felt and you but it also
*  Will protect you but it also can protect you on the other side on the other side it can protect you
*  You know, I watched a video today of these guys broke a new apartment
*  The other side on and places that we talked about is for the other side were places where it's legal like
*  You know the only people that have guns for protection and i'm speaking right living in new york was the police
*  Legally, right legally. Yeah, that's where it gets real crazy, right? Like then it's like
*  California is the opposite
*  California it's not that hard to get a gun
*  You know people would think that california would be way more liberal than new york, but new york
*  It's very difficult to get a handgun
*  You can get like a personal carry not just for like if you have I know if you're a business you carry a certain amount
*  Of money you can get a gun in california. You can get it just by having a clean record
*  Yeah, you can get it for your home. Yeah, um, nevada has really interesting. Well, uh, excuse me. Arizona has real interest
*  Man, I mother fucker picked this up for a show one time his shit was yeah, arizona. You could have it out
*  Yeah, it's a open carry state that's an equalizer that shuts down road rage arizona. Yeah, that's arizona, right?
*  Yeah, it's a wild west down there. I know for sure i've seen a guy that was uh,
*  I had a gig out there. He was not only our driver, but he was he had his shit ready like joe exotic, right?
*  He's in oklahoma. So he's walking around with that. Yeah, that mother fucker. They just have an open carry law there
*  Yo, that's the funniest shit ever but it's so funny people connected with different personalities and i'm watching this shit like
*  Like this motherfucker is really crazy. I was like but he's
*  He was the probably the originator of trolling
*  He was a marketing genius if you think about it. Yeah, he was a marketing genius every time you thought you had him
*  He knew how to flip it. But then he got like what most trolls do
*  They go too hard
*  He turned it to takashi six nine
*  It's like bro, you got enough followers bro, look at you look at you went too fucking hard and that's what it was
*  And that lady went and got him. Yep. It didn't
*  I guess he was so used to
*  trying to win that
*  and
*  Eventually, he lost by trying to win so hard. Well, he was just curl fucking yo, he was fun
*  curl fucking basket
*  Yo, he was funny with that shit, so it was hilarious. It was very very
*  Obviously had a sick obsession with her though. It's not like it's a it's it's cute when you're watching a documentary
*  That doesn't affect you personally when you're watching, you know seven episodes of this guy shooting a carol baskin dummy
*  I don't think he had as much obsession with her as he had obsession with fame and people talking about him and he knew
*  That she was the right person to keep talking about to give him the fame he wanted
*  I believe like he he knew his boys everybody around him that ain't gonna give him the headlines
*  But I think it was also she was going after his business saying that he like she
*  She apparently has a different philosophy on sanctuary. Yeah, what she does is different saving them
*  Yeah, and she's not into the cub pettings, right?
*  There's a whole cub petting industry apparently and so that she was reporting them on that
*  And you know his argument was like what the fuck are you doing like you're doing the same shit
*  Yeah, they're all in cages, bitch. Yeah, they're all in cages, right? Anytime you put a big cat in the cage like right
*  You're doing the same thing. It's you're treating it better in the cage. So you have a holier than that attitude
*  It's crazy, you know, these things should be wild
*  They should be loose in the wild and there should be a few of them
*  Maybe that are if there's a worry about extinction a few of them that are isolated somewhere
*  But to have it like that, it's crazy. They probably had similar
*  They both had similar personality traits because they gave a fuck and didn't give a fuck at the same time
*  Both of them shared some of that but her shit came on the most more peaceful side. His shit was of an aggressive nature
*  He was fucking you want my fucking what but that shit was funny. I ain't gonna lie
*  I would like watching him blow shit up, bro
*  Well, look at him walking around with the knee brace on the guns out and the fucking permanent eyeliner
*  I mean, he's just he's right out of a movie. No when they showed a picture with him with his three husbands. I was like this is
*  Movie worthy they're both saying they're straight
*  Oh, i'm straight you can so you know, you can do that right now, right joe
*  You know that right now, right straight guys can you can this is what i've heard on the streets in certain
*  I ain't gonna say what streets that this is what i'm saying. I understand that this is what I heard
*  On some outlets right that you could suck a dick twice three times. No, no, no
*  No, three, then you would be gay. Okay, you could suck a dick twice. So first is a test second is
*  No, the second was like you confirm your test
*  It's like a double blind placebo controlled dick sucking study it is but it's only two like the same process in the comedy club
*  Two drink minimum like this is what I heard in those streets. I don't know those streets, but you could do it
*  They got a new shit called fluid
*  Oh gender fluid you go back and forth gender fluids means like
*  It'll matter sexual orientation fluid or gender fluid would be you're a boy or a girl you go back and forth
*  From being a boy and a girl
*  Yeah, and it's like any party you go to you win
*  You know, it's like never sausage party not to me chicks. You always fucking win
*  It's all confusing. Well
*  Yeah
*  It is all confusing. I don't know do whatever you want
*  Do that's all you can do whatever you want do whatever you want to do. Just be shouldn't be that big of a deal
*  It's it's the problem is it's big of a deal for other people like that's that's where it really becomes a problem, right?
*  If someone is anything whether they're uh, very masculine very feminine very gay very straight
*  The problem is not what they're doing
*  The problem is how other people think about what they're doing and whether or not they give them a hard time for it
*  They think it's wrong. It's not it's not for you to judge if it's wrong exactly
*  That's where when when it comes to like religion like why do people focus?
*  That's a big one that I always get weirded out with about
*  Particularly with christians. It's like why do you care because if you if you really want to focus on the bible
*  There's so much shit in there that you're not supposed to be doing you're not supposed to eat shellfish
*  You're not supposed to eat certain types animals
*  You're not supposed to wear different two different types of cloth
*  Like if you want to follow the old school, they don't nobody wants to follow it to it's too crazy
*  You you but why do they care about the gay part though?
*  Why is that part like it's a freedom issue
*  It's very clear that those two guys whether they're gay or straight. They wanted to suck joe exotic's dick
*  Okay, that's why they were there. I don't know they wanted to you hanging around with tigers
*  They might have maybe they did it because they like tigers so they suck a dick so they can hang out with tigers, right?
*  But for whatever reason they decided that doing it was better than not doing it
*  Particularly because both of them could have beat the fuck out of him anytime. They wanted to that one guy was gigantic
*  The one young kid like the model looking dude, right? It was a gorilla. He was fucking gigantic with huge ass hands
*  I know you don't want to beat the shit out of that dude
*  But the one I would have beat the guy with three teeth. He would have beat the shit out of him, too
*  Yeah, all I would have beat the shit out of
*  So yeah, three teeth joke. That's what I like it get right in that gap
*  Yo, you ever had a two-fist blowjob from a tattooed motherfucker
*  You haven't lived a tattooed motherfucker with your name tattooed above his dick
*  Yeah, property of the exotic right didn't say something like that
*  Something what did it say?
*  But all those tiger motherfuckers was freaky in some kind of way everyone that was attached to they were all freaky
*  but I you know, I feel like
*  It almost doesn't seem real
*  It's the show so crazy that doesn't seem it's so crazy that a lot of people feel like it's played out
*  Like people talk about it too much. Yeah, because it's just it was great
*  But the thing about it when I say marketing whatever
*  he knew
*  Everything we do record that shit
*  This is that the same guy is that a different one?
*  No, they look like they're doing them. No, he's got it. See what the tattoo is. That's like halloween right there
*  No, there's another one above his dick that he got covered up with a bull. There it is right there bingo
*  Charlamagne and guard right there. Absolutely. What does it say privately owned? Yeah, joe exotic privately owned
*  Ew and look what he turned it into scribbles and a bull
*  He can still see the actual eye he decided to not totally cover it
*  That's like indicative of his whole life. Did you see the follow-up?
*  Did you see the follow-up they did and he was like he was upset
*  He said yeah, the tattoo artist was a little offended because they didn't give him his property. He said the tattoo was fucked up
*  Yo, the thing they care about he's like not the fact that I was blowing his dude like yeah, man
*  Yeah, we didn't like the way that tattoo was tatted. Well, it didn't I that's why I got confused
*  I thought that they were all on meth, right?
*  Didn't you think but what didn't that guy say that he hasn't done anything in like four years?
*  Yeah, I think he said that wasn't from meth or something. Oh
*  Okay
*  Hey, what it is what it is. Yeah, but um, maybe it was hit by an animal
*  That's true, too
*  Like a lot of hockey players have no fucking teeth, but they that's a badge of honor for hockey players
*  They don't give they got enough. They like fuck that shit. I like to take them out and show you
*  In canada you see him off like that you think he's a millionaire and fucking
*  In uh fucking ohio is like that motherfucker's hitting that meth
*  Have you ever seen the photograph of that old school hockey player who has all these scars all over his face?
*  No, I don't know. Do you know what i'm talking about jamie?
*  It's it was a recreation of every scar this guy had ever had on his face over his career
*  There's a it's a famous photograph and you could see these I mean it looks like he's just been in a fucking box cutter fight
*  His whole face is just butchered. Yeah, because all they did was look at this guy's face
*  Yeah, that's it. And what was it?
*  Yeah, bro, he was a goalie before they wear masks bro, they're like one of them kossacks
*  Cosmetic surgery facilities in fucking la dude. He was a goalie before they used
*  Fucking masks. Look at his damn before he was just straight face. They would just take it in the mug son
*  You imagine a guy slap sticking one of those fucking hard ass pucks
*  How fast can they make those things go now they can make them go well over 120 120 40?
*  What is that? Yeah. Oh my god, really i'll check fast a slap shot. Yeah, I think it's even probably faster
*  Have you seen that video of that dude who does that long drive with the golf club? Do you know i'm talking about?
*  This is jack dude
*  There's this really jack dude who hits this guy. He's got this crazy step through happy madison or happy gilmore type
*  Stroke to it and he makes the ball fly, you know, it's like one of those outdoor ranges it flies over the back net
*  It's the most ridiculous thing i've ever seen in my life
*  Oh, you probably saw a clip of somebody hitting it out like at the top shot golf thing
*  Yeah, yeah, i've seen this you see but you've seen that one guy who steps sideways. He steps to it like happy gilmore
*  It is about to kill it it's bonkers how far that thing flies I want to find out what that
*  Is a baseball player wasn't it? He holds the maybe he looks like a baseball. He's a big dude
*  He looks like he looks like a pro baseball player, but he holds the long
*  distance world record for uh
*  For a golf ball drive like drove it the furthest so he holds the record dude
*  It's the craziest shit i've ever seen in my life
*  But i'm, no, I don't follow hockey like that i've been to one hockey match I was in new york
*  I think with the rangers played somebody but i've been to a couple they're fun. It's wild in person
*  You know, it's like on tv. There's a lot of things like that stand up is a good example
*  There's a lot of things like that. We see it on tv. It's like, yeah, it looks good
*  But if you're there you're like, oh shit, you watch people skate by and fly. Yeah, that's what it was the interest for me
*  And then you know, yeah, i'm black you go to hockey you like you just want to see a fight
*  You like this one this shit, you don't even know who's playing who you like. Oh shit
*  He just fucked him up dudes know how to fight now
*  There's some hockey fights where you watch guys throw like crisp punches like with technique and like oh Jesus
*  You think they train for 100?
*  Yeah, yeah, you can fight. It's the only sport where you can fight like look
*  You you do you practice hitting the puck? Yeah, okay
*  We'll practice beating the fuck out of people can do that too. That's part of the game
*  Part of the game is beating the fuck out of each other. That's the highlight of the game ever
*  Well, there's no other sport just stop and think about that
*  I know no other sport we could fight bare knuckle in the middle of an ice skating rink at a drop of a hat
*  And continue to be friends at the end of that shit and the referees all let you do it they step back
*  Yeah, they never like keep talking to they never like fuck you. I'm gonna see you tomorrow. It's like pop. I got it
*  There's some videos a dude's getting flatlined though
*  It's different than it was back in the day because back in the day
*  They were tough guys who knew how to skate and could maybe fight a little bit
*  And so they'd grab each other's fucking their jackets or grab their their clothes and they'd be punching each other
*  Slam and move it all crazy now dudes are hitting guys with hip throws and slamming them onto the ice knocking them unconscious
*  I seen a dude hit a guy with a perfect counter right hand a dude swung on him
*  He backed up like this to right there. Let it pass right just hit him like oh that guy could fight
*  That's a that's a guy with like real skills. That's a smart motherfucker
*  Yeah, he just stood right in front of the guy let the guy throw a punch and then boom countered him
*  I couldn't even imagine having that
*  You know, you might have to fight to balance yourself on skates and just like
*  Do cat I wonder how you compare that look the asterisk this guy this guy he jacks it
*  He didn't even really run up to it. He's called the swing man
*  That's how I go what i'm saying. He doesn't run up to it, but he picks his leg up
*  It's a weird watch his move see that boom
*  Bro
*  You gotta go to videos of him 106 miles an hour for the fastest slap shot. That's insane
*  That's so fast with that puck 106 miles an hour that puck hits you in the face
*  Some people can pitch that fast too, right? I don't know what the world record of pitches. What's the world record pitch?
*  Aldous
*  I'm gonna guess
*  I'm gonna guess 111
*  Is that ridiculous?
*  105 yeah aldous chapman
*  Damn that's funny. How do you hit that? It's motherfuckers to be connected with that shit
*  You don't hit that right how many times can they throw that fast?
*  That's the thing a couple times in a row. I think he burns his arm out pretty fast
*  I would imagine how could you not burn your arm out? Think of how much explosion is involved in this
*  God damn that was a
*  That was a blink of an eye
*  It's interesting like the mechanics of when you watch a real amazing pitcher
*  There's this crazy body torque going on. Look at this whip
*  There's so much in that man. There's like there's so much
*  Mechanical movement and leverage in your legs and your back and coordinate
*  I was like what's in the last 10 years?
*  It was about nine years ago. You ever see this video of the bird that's flying by right when the pitch comes at it
*  And they caught it in slow motion. The bird explodes
*  That's fucking crazy was it randy randy johnson. Yeah, that's right. Oh, yeah, randy johnson the rocket he used to tear shit up
*  He was exciting
*  He I don't know when his when during his era
*  People were excited because all on the news. I already knew this watch this
*  Damn he hit the bird right in mid-flight and the bird exploded
*  Imagine the end for that birdie be like how the fuck look at the world has a plan. Here's your plan birdie
*  Booyakasha, oh
*  Yeah
*  curl fucking basket
*  Leveled man fucking crazy. Is that no ceremony? No nothing. No that bird's dead as fuck
*  Imagine that I mean that dude's throwing 100 miles an hour, right or 90s. That's the ultimate something told me not to turn right there
*  Oh, no, just went right by it I guess
*  No, that's the randy johnson. Yeah, there's a couple
*  One minute video look at his mechanics. Did go back to that the video again the part where randy johnson
*  Look at look at the mechanics of how he throws his body into that pitch. Look at this
*  You step off there's so much good. It's like a little
*  Coordinated movement he's been every it didn't matter. Yeah, what's all that torque and leverage?
*  No matter what 11 he was that big? Yeah
*  Just think about all that leverage man
*  Plus he can reach almost a foot closer if not more than that than any other pitcher so he's
*  Literally releasing it at a closer distance than anybody else, you know, so yeah less time. That's true. That's a good way to look at it
*  That leverage is leverage is interesting man, you know, because it's such a it has such a huge factor in some sports
*  You ever throw a pitch out?
*  No way. I'm embarrassed. I don't want to hurt my shoulder
*  It's just like in your ego because they had one shot of 50 cent throwing a pitch out
*  And he looked so gay doing it. It was funny. I think he probably had that deleted from the internet
*  I just saw this yesterday. I don't know why it was coming around
*  But this is bo jackson throwing somebody out flat-footed from the outfield. Oh, that's not the sorry
*  It's not this one, but it's his next one official dude. Bo jackson was
*  One of the freakiest athletes of all time. His arm is so crazy
*  Everything was crazy
*  If he didn't get hurt in that football game look at this jumps off the wall so he avoids all the impact
*  Literally just ran up the wall. Yeah, bo
*  Bo knew everything
*  he's a
*  Very interesting guy football. That was just two sports right play two sports but world class at both sports
*  It wasn't until the football injury that uh,
*  He had to get a hip replacement
*  And that kind of growing up he was the first person you pick like I got this motherfucker on what sport everything anything and everything
*  There's certain dudes just have
*  The the perfect build the perfect genetics and then work ethic another one is a herschel walker
*  Like herschel walker his knees are destroyed now. How could they not be? How could they not be?
*  Yeah, they say he like he can barely like he can barely walk now
*  He'll still fuck you up herschel walkie was he was fucking people up in strike force when he was in his late 40s
*  I was thinking earl campbell. That's the one that's like really really like bad. I don't think herschel walker has bad knees
*  He was fighting almost until he was 50. He was fighting in strike force a lot of you don't know that yeah herschel walker
*  at
*  48 49 whatever he was when he was fighting looked like a 30 year old
*  Perfect specimen of an athlete. He didn't look like a an older
*  Athlete like doing something different like trying to fight. It looks like he's fucking world-class
*  ripped full six-pack super jacked still
*  Discipline at 40. What's what is his age there? What does it say 48 48 look at that right there?
*  Yes, dude look at the build on this fucking guy, and he destroyed the student strike force
*  He beat a few guys
*  He was undefeated in MMA and the way he would beat these guys was just first of all he had a long
*  martial arts background like you've done martial arts before I did not never know any of this but he's got such a crazy
*  Disciplined work ethic that like his body is still in pristine shape in his late 40s now
*  I don't know if he's taking hormones or anything here
*  But either way the way this guy looked in his 40s in the way. I mean just like his face
*  Yeah, that's crazy that guy would do push-ups and sit-ups and bodyweight squats and and and shit over
*  Weightlifting that was like his big thing was that he did mostly calisthenics. I had no idea that he ever did that dude
*  Hershel Walker was a
*  So, you know everything that motherfucker but dude his that's the thing when when he started fighting people were like, oh, you know
*  He's like a guy who still wants to compete who used to be world-class at something
*  He probably won't be good at fighting right fucking people
*  When we just looked at it didn't look like it was just like a show like no no
*  He looks like a professional mixed martial arts fighter
*  I wouldn't say he looked like the best in the world
*  But he was professional and he even went to one of the best gyms in the world. He went to aka
*  Aka is in san jose. It's one of the best mixed martial arts kane velasquez daniel cormi a john fitch
*  Uh, josh koshchek we can go down the list a lot of training fighters came out of there. Yeah, it's a
*  great gym
*  Um, and they have been training world-class fighters forever. So he went to the lions den
*  He went nirmakham ed off training. He went to mike swick trained there. I mean, it's the he was a comedy store
*  He went to the comics. He went to the comedy. He went right in there and he trained there. Look at that
*  Look at that build come on man
*  Who the fuck looks like that in their late 40s and does professional cage fighting?
*  After a long career in the nfl
*  I mean, that's something special man. He was I had no idea. Oh my god, dude
*  And i'm telling you every fight was like this every fight was like a man versus boys
*  You watched them all of course you did. I watched everything. Yeah, that's a dumb question. I watched a lot of shit
*  Yeah, I know like a lot of shit. Yeah, you read a lot of audio books, too
*  I do you read a lot you read a lot of audio read a lot of audio books
*  But that's all I want to say you read a lot of audio books, I mostly read articles
*  But I get my books I consume my books in the audio form because I can do other shit
*  Like I can go on a walk when I walk my dog and listen to a book when I was talking to
*  The person that helped me with the candle and I got the fact about the whale shit. I was like this motherfucker
*  Is going to be all over that shit ambergris. I knew it. I was like, this is right up his sperm whales
*  Is it crazy that it's just to dissolve beaks? That's what I mean like pearls, right?
*  That's just like a coating that an oyster puts over a rock or something. That's inside its mouth
*  Isn't that what it is?
*  And then like he gets irritated and it creates this coating and puts it over and it becomes super value to us
*  How long but then but that's over?
*  well, it can't be a long time because
*  Uh oysters not don't live with so long. What's the time? That's a good question period
*  How long to be able to develop a fucking pearl? Let's just guess this is a total guess
*  How long do you think an oyster?
*  Stays alive if you had to guess like how how old does an oyster get i'll say i'll say um
*  15 years. Wow, I was gonna say three
*  I would love to know the answer to this. I wonder if they know
*  Like, you know, they don't about to be purled up. I think they don't know how old sharks get
*  Well, it takes I just look for it takes two to four years for it to form the pearl
*  But uh, they live anywhere from two to 41 years 41 years for an oyster
*  Joe I joe no, I was closest. No, you said two. It's two. I said 17. I said three i'm one away
*  This is a oyster's 20 years
*  To 41 it's like well sometimes babies die when they're one day old how old the people's like two to 41 but I was closer
*  Yeah, oh, okay. I'll give it to you. I was closer to the life expectancy
*  I feel so proud about that. I thought it was like uh, like an octopus because octopus is real quick, right?
*  Octopus are real smart, but they I think they have a very short lifespan
*  I think octopus
*  Human they're fucking clever. They're clever and they're mean as shit and they're smart. Yeah, they're like an evil alien
*  That's what they look they're in the same family
*  Mollusks, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So like that's why it's similar to is a crustacean the same as a mosque isn't um,
*  They're related so i'm not they're not like the same same but is a shellfish a crustacean because a crab is a crustacean, right?
*  I just like saying big words. They are all like crustacean
*  What's that restaurant crab crustacean that's the only time I use that word oysters a bivalve in the octopus
*  Is like a gastropod or cephalopod? Yeah, I was
*  That's right
*  What is the life expectancy of uh, what's a cephalopod? Yeah, wait, that's like two to four years depending on yeah
*  Yeah, look at it before right. Okay. Yeah, we have
*  Two to four years is nothing for something that's smart. That's what's so weird. Imagine you're not that smart
*  They can't live longer than that motherfucker. Don't be tools. There's no doctors under there
*  They do grow their limbs back and when men when males and females breed sometimes the female just decides to kill the male and eat it
*  Females are larger habits quarantine
*  That's coming out of quarantine motherfucker. If we make this all your limbs, we're gonna eat that shit
*  A male's octopus his dick is also his limbs
*  What does it say? The largest bivalve is the giant clam which reaches a length of four feet and weighs 500 pounds. Holy shit
*  Holy shit. Did you know that a four foot clam that weighs 500 pounds. That's crazy. That's like the little mermaid lives in there
*  Is it part of a menu?
*  I mean do people we should eat the fuck out of that thing at least 500 years old
*  It's also the oldest known animal can live to 500 years old two to 500 years, I guess
*  Yo, I was the closest again, no, I didn't take a guess on that one. That's crazy crazy
*  But um octopus's dick is also its tentacles and sometimes it has to give up its dick
*  It'll like let an arm separate so that the female doesn't eat it
*  Because females would just jack eat the dick that eats up. Well, they eat the arm
*  They'll take his dick which is also his arm take one of his tentacles and they'll eat that and like it's almost like he's
*  Like here eat my arm. I'm not so what is back dude? It's the craziest shit ever
*  There's a lot of videos of it female octopus is just jack male
*  Octopuses and kill them and eat them for the dick or the arm. You don't know their whole body is the same thing
*  And they stuff them they stuff them into like holes in the in the reef and just peck away at them for days
*  Yo, why do you sell as much as that where you got more excited about more and more and more
*  I'm fascinated by that shit. You're fascinated about every god damn thing
*  But this is something to be fascinated by because this is a living thing that we can look if we found this on another planet
*  We'd be freaking the fuck out if they sent uh, uh, one of those, uh
*  Probes those like mars probes to another planet and they found this
*  Just laying in an ocean somewhere and they they studied this
*  This is the life form on this planet that's dominant and sometimes the females which are super intelligent
*  Sometimes they just kill the males and eat them. That's what this guy's doing. This this girl rather is killing this guy
*  She's killing him right now. She's strangling him and and biting him and slowly eating him
*  And biting him and slowly eating him
*  The fact that you could do a play by play that might have been one of the most impressive things i've seen
*  They're mean of octopus getting eaten up eaten up by his wife. They're smart and mean they don't live very long. It tastes good, too
*  They taste real good, but they're smart calamari all day
*  That's squid
*  I don't think they're as smart. No. Oh, yeah, I don't think squid are that smart. Are they are they smart? Who's smarter?
*  Octopus. I love grill. I love grill. Yeah, they change color and stuff. Oh, that's true
*  Set what is the other one that does cuttlefish? Yeah cuttlefish does that's a little shit ones the ones that blow up
*  No, they're the that's a puffer. Yeah cuttlefish is like this weird thing. That's like it's not quite a squid
*  It's not quite an octopus, but it looks a lot like them
*  It's a similar thing and it can change colors and they're still freaky. That's what it looks like
*  That thing's freaky, but get a video see if there's a video
*  They say i'm not into this weird dude. This is these things just to do uh
*  Cuttlefish uh camouflage
*  Do they look exactly like their surrounding and they just jack things like that
*  So they blend in perfectly with the environment even the texture they can look like coral. Look at that. Oh, yeah
*  They can look like the rocks on the bottom
*  They look like all kinds of different things and they can change really quickly to blend in with whatever the background is
*  They're freaky man. That's crazy. They're really freaky
*  What it tastes like fucking the end of anything what it's just good
*  I think they taste people eat them. I know that people eat anything. They eat cuttlefish
*  I think it's like a like a luxury fish. It's like, you know
*  Very I think it's highly sought after in some uh, ethnic cookings, right like asian style cookings
*  I know i've had it. I know i've had it. Yeah
*  Cuttlefish cooking tips. Mm. Yeah, I don't know. Yeah. Well you do elk so cuttlefish is now you can't be far from
*  The pussy fat squid there's not that much difference
*  I know you could sell me on it because I I try different things but certain places you go you're just a chick with the sloppy mouth
*  Yeah, people love that
*  She's chowing down on dude. That looks good as fuck. That looks real good. It looks weird
*  It looks like an alien thing. Yeah, I could do that. It's just like squid. She says
*  If you saw that on another planet if they found an animal underwater another planet
*  That could change color and blend in with its environment. They don't even know how the fuck it does that
*  They don't know how they do that
*  They watch them do that and they try to figure out how the fuck this thing instantly mimics the texture of coral and blends right in
*  But that's years of evolution. Oh for sure. But I mean it's it's beyond
*  What anything else on this planet can do like you look at like what we can do we can do shit
*  We didn't well we could exactly like we reproduce yes, and the act of that is the simplest thing you could do in your life
*  The act of reproduction. Oh my it's uh, it makes thing, you know nine months later. You're responsible for something true
*  Yeah, and it's your your body's program to want that more than anything to reproduce or to sex sexual
*  Oh, yeah, but then I program for that and to reproduce though ultimately, right? That's what's crazy about
*  So that's what somebody could say somebody cheat. They was like
*  I was just feeding my need to reproduce you can't say I was just being unfaithful
*  I don't think that's gonna fly. Okay, but it's amazing that it wasn't much of our society is based on the
*  Unsexual desire, right? It really is just a call to reproduce like a girl's ass and a girl with big tits and small waist
*  Like you see that it's like a program that runs in the brain that gets the body saying
*  Oh you you need to get you need to make it
*  Yeah, but it is something then that comes that becomes get to a mental part too and that's that happens with women and guys
*  You know people should meet up for dates and get tested
*  Once they get testing everywhere people should meet up for dates get tested and then go out
*  But kind of a fun little thing to do. Yeah, it would be it would be i'm telling it's gonna go back to that second wave
*  Yeah, somebody's gonna slip through somebody's like, you know, it's like
*  I wish I knew if that's the case. I don't know. I don't know this situation man. This situation
*  It's gonna change for so much shit, bro
*  The way people think about so much things and it's gonna you know
*  Ultimately, it'll make us a better people or a better place
*  It'll change a lot
*  But we're still very fortunate and we should just use this time to make a better situation for ourselves
*  I said we can do that. I say that too. I say that to people. I was like
*  It's easy to get down it's easy to have an excuse why you don't want to do something
*  But you know or you could challenge it and that's what it is
*  The real problem is people with families that lost their job
*  That's a real problem being able to put food on the table people being able to you know, they
*  Want to get their business back up. How can they possibly make a living again?
*  It's not like anything else where people lost their business. They didn't make any bad mistakes
*  You know if a certain if a person makes a bunch of bad mistakes and they lose their business
*  They kind of at least know what happened
*  But when all of a sudden if you've been working hard your whole life and you have a successful business and then boom
*  The floor falls out in a month. Yeah, but then I will say trump. I mean
*  What I get from trumping them that they have been
*  Or trying to be as aggressive
*  with uh keeping small businesses alive more than anything. Yeah, and that's a good move. It's very important
*  Restaurants small businesses, but you know, they're dirty there was a thing today in uh, I think it was the washington post where they were talking about
*  How they're already out of that money that they deemed for uh, small business loans. They ran out
*  They're already this is recent because I know where they went back for more money. This is what we do. It was today
*  Yeah, I was reading something today
*  Um, I don't know, uh what paper it was but it was there was it was the washington post all of them all of them
*  and it's basically saying that
*  They need to figure out how to keep doing this if they're gonna if we're gonna social distance protect
*  Particularly in california like we the idea is may 19th now or may 15th. Is that what it is may 15th, I think
*  15,000 now
*  Yeah, I mean and how are they gonna start it back up and what are they gonna do start it back up and what?
*  What are people gonna be like like how long is it gonna take before everybody settles back in again?
*  You know, they don't they don't really know they don't but it feels like if they they they ease it up or
*  Ease it up that that's gonna be more for like you say people at work
*  Right. Yeah, that's where the issue would come in is like how people are gonna feel comfortable going to work
*  Right if you we were talking about guys who work at grocery stores, right?
*  Right used to work at a grocery store. It was just a job now
*  It's a job that could kill you like what like it doesn't even pay that well imagine a job that doesn't pay
*  That well that could kill you
*  Yeah
*  So imagine being there right now and dealing with these people coughing and walking back and forth everywhere
*  You look all these new people all you're being constantly exposed to these people's air and it used to just be a regular job
*  Now all of a sudden it's a regular job that might get you so sick. You could die like fuck
*  That's why they bought me this they're gonna go try you gotta fucking raise that minimum wage now watch that's gonna probably happen
*  Well, I guarantee that'll probably happen. This is what we're realizing in all of this is that if
*  You do have a crisis. This is the good thing the vast majority of people comply
*  With what's needed to you know, stay home just go to the supermarket do essential things come back
*  Just stay home. Let's just let this shit die off
*  Let the people that have it right now
*  Let them get to a point where they're not transmitting it to anybody else anymore
*  Everybody stay away from each other and let's just nip this shit in the bud
*  And the way you look at it in terms of like different philosophies at different places that have done it
*  Some places have not been so aggressive and they've experienced a lot of cases and you could say well, yeah
*  But those people they're gonna it's gonna go through their immune system quicker and they'll be able to go back to work quicker
*  I'm like, yeah, I don't know. I don't know
*  but I do know that California has a very low number of deaths in in particular in a low number of
*  It's it's a low number of people that have gotten gravely ill in comparison to the size of the state
*  Like if you compare it to new york, which is a very high number of people in new york the population of five like
*  5.5 million in brooklyn alone and everyone's on top and everybody's like why is so so shocked?
*  It is an epic epicenter. It's because everybody's there and everybody live up in the sky
*  It's all about like when do you jump like when do you make a move and california made a move a little bit quicker?
*  You know and it's it's that's that's really what it is
*  like who acts the quickest and you gotta do and I do understand like the tough mandates because
*  You have to
*  Lay it down because people will be easy. Yeah and lax with it
*  They are but there's also people that are getting too much of a kick out of telling people what to do
*  You know like they're kicking people out of parks when it's like a family of three and there's no one else in the park
*  Like come on
*  Like relax. There's no one here if you're there and there's no one else there leave the fucking people alone
*  Let them enjoy the park now if other people come and they get too close to each other then step in and stop them
*  But I mean we're so but if they do it like that, then it's always gonna be somebody's gonna try to push it
*  So I can understand to like fuck it. Nobody. Yeah, I mean like I took my son for a walk the other day
*  and like he's
*  Doesn't really know what's going on, but he knows what's going on and he was on his little scooter, right?
*  And i'm like he was just happy to be out right just you know, and he had his mask when I was like is that the future?
*  You know the little man that little mask i'm like
*  You know, we're gonna get so weird with each other
*  I mean if you wanted a formula right if you were if you if you wanted to be a real conspiracy theorist
*  And you want a formula to get people?
*  to
*  to more more easily
*  Be separated
*  And more easily give in to the future of machines taking over the world
*  This is what you do you give them a fucking disease where they can't even be human anymore. They can't hug each other
*  They can't kiss they can't even get close because they're worried. They're going to get a disease that's going to kill them
*  So what do you make them do on top of that you make them wear a mask?
*  So now you can't even see each other's facial expressions. You can't even look a person in the eye
*  You just see like you see the eyes only. Yeah, but something is going to make I understand what you're saying
*  But something is going to make those people feel more comfortable
*  quicker
*  Testing with quicker results a vaccine. I don't know how long it's going to take to get there
*  But something is going to give people a vote of confidence
*  Imagine and that's going to be with those numbers of like people want excited about like what is it?
*  What is it called flattened out? They're like, oh shit flatten the curve. Yes, flatten the curve
*  It's going to be something to give people more confidence. And then when people have more confidence
*  Some people are going to push it right and some people are going to be like like we say it's going to be the new normal
*  They're going to be doing taking extra precautions. I don't know the next time i'll do a meet and greet
*  Right a meet and greet that part of pretty much that part of our business is going to be gone for for some time for sure
*  Do you remember that uh spring break footage of those kids they caught down in mexico? Yeah going crazy or is it florida?
*  It was florida florida might as well be mexico florida is not america right?
*  That is not america
*  So they go down there. I mean if you're from florida relax, i'm joking. They're not going to relax relax
*  They're going to be okay. My sister lives in florida. This is when donnell said they're blaming on me
*  459 donnell said he hated florida get him those kids watching those kids on the beach
*  Because there was no laws there was no law yet. So these kids and they moved slowly. They were like the last state, right?
*  They were last state well, they
*  Florida just said that professional wrestling is an essential business
*  really
*  mcmahon who asked that is hilarious
*  Didn't that's true, right?
*  What is the exact statement because I don't want to because it sounds so ridiculous
*  I don't want to fuck this up. They said they rushed to judgment
*  I think they might have just reevaluated things. Oh, did they reevaluate it now? Yeah. Yeah. No, no, originally originally. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
*  Oh
*  You know, they're going to be taping this weekend, but if a show if a show
*  It says show that gives people jobs and is produced. It's creating jobs with other people
*  Couldn't that be considered a essential job to the people that work there? Yes, so every job is essential then
*  That's what I was trying to say. Yeah, the wwe is now considered essential service in florida
*  It's a service officials in the state permitted employees at professional sports and media production with a national audience to hold an event
*  If it is close to the public
*  Yeah, I think you should be able to if you test everybody and everybody's negative
*  And like again test takes 15 minutes and apparently they're working on ones that work a lot quicker
*  And I say that joe I said that's when it's going to shift like I say people getting somewhat
*  a little bit of uh voter confidence when you know that uh
*  You could get results rapid. Yeah, I want to know if they made it in a lab or if they came out of a lab
*  They got to get everything. I want to know no, I mean the the virus itself
*  The the big theory is not just not even that they made it in a lab
*  That's not what they think what they do think is it escaped from a lab?
*  And that this was something that they were working on in this lab
*  With the very same type of bats they were working on in this lab. This is reported by none other than fox news
*  I believe
*  They have a lab there they're working on bats are they working on viruses and it came from the very area
*  It's not it's not impossible to pretend. It's impossible seems a little crazy for me that bad
*  I heard it might be my bat story was a
*  Somebody I my bat my story was bat and a snake was involved with in some kind of way
*  There's a pangolin people thought that it was uh that bats
*  Like this was someone told me that bats transferred over to pangolins, which is this weird fucking armadillo looking creature
*  I know you're talking about a little funny looking weird thing. Yeah, I know like a dinosaur looking thing
*  Yeah, and that somehow or another that got to people but then they thought it was a lady who was patient zero who worked
*  Next to a stand that was selling bats, but this article claims that the wet market
*  The whole reason why that story got out
*  It was a cover story for the fact that it escaped from their lab
*  But of course that sounds so much like a plot in a movie like you read it and you go
*  Wow, it's too almost too attractive every other uh news reporting like cnn mbc is
*  This says that the u.s officials are now looking into that unverified theory pushed
*  By yesterday, it doesn't say fox
*  Movie this whole thing feels like a movie 100 like a movie like to see time square
*  Yeah with nobody nobody
*  Yeah
*  Nobody my friend john joseph
*  Took a run off across the brooklyn bridge today and took a picture of him standing on top of the brooklyn bridge on his instagram
*  And behind him. It's just empty like like iam legend shit
*  Yeah, it's like a couple people in the background. You can see them way far in the background
*  But a normal day on the brooklyn bridge where people walk you get hit trying to yeah, but
*  I believe that
*  It's gonna
*  My belief don't mean may not mean too much to anybody but has to start back up again
*  When is the big question and what is it going to be like?
*  You know, I I hope people just having to be a continuation of
*  I think it's gonna be a continuation of what's going on down now going on right now
*  with the social distancing and stuff, but it's just like
*  Businesses aren't opening because this but this is going to be this is gonna be six foot. It's going to be six feet
*  Mask and everything for a while. You can believe that shit
*  For a while. Yeah, imagine the people that were already germ freaks
*  Right neil bryndan. I was like I said neil bryndan is a germ freak neil bryndan and white people knew neil bryndan and white
*  podcasters knew that this was going to happen
*  They knew they knew it was going to be a point where we're not going to go on a roll. We'll be good
*  And neil bryndan is a germ folk and I laughed at him. I even called him gay for um
*  Fist bumping everybody he knew he did it way way ago. I never thought this was happening
*  You knew it could happen though somewhere in your imagination. I know
*  There was a scenario or story you if anybody would have been like what if I think you've seen this movie
*  In your brain, I've seen a bunch of movies in my brain
*  That's what bothers me what bothers me is complacency
*  That uh, I think it's real easy for people to just keep on keeping on
*  I think if you look at
*  A lot of the problems that we have in our culture are from poor decision making
*  And where people choose comfort over doing a smarter thing. That's harder to do. That's going to help your life
*  The easy route. Yeah, it's real real real real real real real real real common with people
*  It's part of you. It's part of me. I have it in my say we all have it. We all fight it, right?
*  This is making you realize
*  What's really important you 100% this this is what I mean
*  This is when you can realize like oh me losing weight is not about me looking good
*  It's about me staying alive
*  Like it might be the difference between me dying from this shit or skating through it. It makes you and then it makes you
*  Think about it when we weren't thinking about it at all. Exactly. We weren't thinking about think about it
*  You see you the date I've seen motherfuckers you go to a motherfucking airport
*  Motherfuckers, you know a quick piss in and out or whatever. You got a motherfucker just like
*  Come right out the joint. Don't wash your hands or anything clearly. I didn't even think I was I was
*  I know about washing hands whatever but I didn't know that hand sanitizer was that gangster
*  Yo, I thought people have hand sanitizer was gay like all right
*  Oh, you old mr. Old germo folk, but then you realize those precaution is moving forward. Those are going to help us
*  Yeah, you got to be
*  You got to understand that every surface that you touch has been touched by a bunch of other people
*  It has the potential to have something on it and that's just how it is
*  It doesn't mean you shouldn't touch things anymore. Just be real careful what you do with your face afterward
*  It's like a conscious face like you take for granted you because you take for granted. It's like it's easy
*  It's easy just to be like hey, what's up?
*  I know that but the other thing is
*  The stuff that you get in contact with your immune system gets stronger when you're in contact with more things
*  Like kids particularly when they're young they say, you know, they used to have what were they called chickenpox party?
*  Yeah, we had chicken pop party. I was telling somebody but I didn't know white people did that too. I apparently I read about it
*  Yeah, black. Yeah, it's just like just I think it's just a common thing that americans did back before they gave kids vaccines for it
*  Once you got chicken pops, it was about to be a sleepover. Mm-hmm
*  And everybody get it one time. Yeah, get it out of the way. I'll just tell somebody about the other day
*  Apparently, it's real bad when you get it when you're an adult. Yeah, not good. Yeah, same with the measles measles
*  Well measles kills kids too. But if you say if you hear an adult with chicken pops, you're like, where the fuck did you go?
*  Where have you been chicken pops?
*  By the way, how do you not get vaccinated for that by this time? Okay, dude, there's a chicken pox vaccine, right?
*  I had it when I was kid. You can tell that old motherfuckers got this shit right there that little yeah
*  But that's also is that chicken pox that one or is that I think that's smallpox too I think it's measles
*  We got there's a bunch of vaccinations chicken pop chicken pop our vaccinations scarred us up when we were kids
*  Right. I had one in my arm like my whole life. I had this weird scar on the top my old school scar
*  It's chicken. Look at you. Let me oh you got one of those
*  Like that's like old school. Yeah, you got it was a 1995
*  The vaccine varicella before that were four million cases a year. That's crazy. That's crazy
*  Who's gonna be?
*  There's going to be a comedy club that says
*  Fuck it
*  Let's get opening
*  Someone's gonna do it. Somebody's gonna do it. You scared to make people sign waivers
*  Say the the club's not responsible if you get sick
*  You know is that irresponsible to do is that irresponsible to do I don't know is it
*  Look tell people to get tested
*  Tell them to get tested when it's available when testing is readily available and treatments readily available
*  I think only then are we going to relax. Yeah, I said it. Yep. It's the truth
*  It's like then the question is like what do you how do you tell people that you don't have it?
*  Like if you go to a bar, are they gonna are you gonna submit to having an app?
*  That's probably i've heard that there may be some type I heard in wahan or whatever
*  They have some type of system where it is an app where I guess you register
*  And you could scan and see
*  I know that has to be in development, dude. I was just talking to somebody about it other day
*  I don't know exactly what it is, but I think that that technology exists
*  Do you follow willy d from the ghetto boys? Yeah, go to his instagram and he's got a post
*  Where there's a company
*  That's sticking a microchip in these people's arms
*  They hired a fucking professional tattooist and piercer a professional piercer guy what could do what has to come in before you to
*  Get it in what the fuck imagine if your company tells you done now. I know you don't want to bring keys
*  You know if I bring the keys everywhere, I'm just gonna give you a little microchip
*  I'm gonna make sure you show it up work on time. You don't have to punch in anymore. You're all set
*  You can you literally they're literally like great. They're going for it in this video. I'm just laughing and joking around about it
*  That is real, right?
*  We didn't get hoaxed. Did we get hoaxed because it was it's a news story. If it's not real
*  I can't believe it. I don't know about it on his page, but I'd know I know exactly what you're talking about
*  Some i've watched it almost like what if you think about it out are they thinking it's the same there it is
*  This company embeds microchips in its employees and they love it
*  It
*  Got rfid because in their hands
*  Those are probably people that know that
*  Anything they probably know that anything that the government wants to find out about you
*  They can find it out whenever they want look at this when patrick mcmullen wants a diet. Dr
*  Pepper while he's at work, he pays for it with a wave of his hand
*  Oh, we'll definitely don't carry credit cards anymore. That's too hard to do
*  There's just dude just let him put a microchip in you and pay it with a wave of your hand
*  I think uh laguardia
*  One of the airports in new york has got the experimental thing going where they have in one of the terminals
*  A place where you can go shop
*  You just swipe your credit card when you walk in and you just leave with whatever you got and they charge you
*  Like like those amazon stores. It's the same technology. I guess amazon's licensing it out. Well, that makes sense
*  It's still a credit card though. Like it's not a chip the amazon store. You don't wave your card
*  I think you just have your phone with you kind of and it's just like knows that you have
*  As long as you can leave it at home this you can't leave at home. This is what's so crazy about this
*  How hard is it you lazy bitch? You can't pull your fucking credit card out
*  You you're willing to let them put a microchip in there so you can get a diet. Dr
*  Pepper with a hand move you can loan somebody money with a dap
*  At his office. He's one of dozens of employees
*  Who've been doing likewise for a year now. That's very funny. Imagine that's how you give each other money. Yeah like that
*  Dap slap a cash app slap out. You can't touch now because the corona what you're gonna do. Oh, yeah
*  That's why oh I couldn't pay you bro
*  social distancing
*  mcmullen is the president of
*  Three square market a technology company that provides self-service mini markets
*  To hospitals hotels and company break rooms last august he became one of roughly 50 employees at its headquarters in river falls, wisconsin
*  Would volunteer to have a chip injected into their hand fucking yikes
*  What I saw was a dude was getting it in his forearm. I was it must be a different company
*  So this is what's scary is this going to be the new norm?
*  Like what if you get fired by these people and you get hired by amazon?
*  Do you have to put in one of their chips? Do you have to take out your old chip?
*  Do they sell the chip to the company?
*  Are we being my guess would be when you leave?
*  Give me my chip back
*  Oh my god, they cut you open but that doesn't
*  That does not surprise me in the least it doesn't surprise me
*  But it alarms me it alarms me that people are so interested in having someone put a chip in their body
*  But we have a company that tells you you have to do it
*  The company tells you you have to do that fuck that company, but I know it but those are people that
*  Feel that they need they need to feel the need of
*  Being a part of new technology. I want it if that's the hot shit motherfucker's gonna have it
*  This was 2014 says microchips will be implanted into healthy people sooner than you think it's gonna happen
*  Yeah, it's gonna happen. I mean they they called it. It's gonna happen for
*  2014 for people like I say look think about it joe somebody with alzheimer's
*  Yeah, you know i'm saying they're gonna find a smart reason if somebody is um, abducted
*  You know i'm saying it's like
*  It's weird to think about it. But then if you really think about it, it's
*  It's gonna be weird but it's still not there's gonna be plenty of reasons why I'm gonna say tell me where your chip is
*  And people don't want to tell us cut your hand off this article. I don't like it right here the
*  Talks about this guy getting a oh jesus christ look at this chip a year later gassan
*  Infected his own implant with a computer virus one that could pass on to other computer systems
*  if the building's networks were programmed to read his chip as
*  gasol
*  Breezed around the workplace spreading the virus and corrupting computer systems
*  Certain areas of the building became inaccessible to his colleagues
*  Jesus christ
*  That's how that's how wars are gonna be for yes
*  Yo, motherfucker don't give a fuck if you can fight it wars like this
*  who
*  Can hack this shit?
*  That's where the wars that it's not going to be the physical shit
*  It's going to be like you got one motherfucker in the room
*  Yeah, that could crash some shit like that, you know what that fucking do to everybody dude
*  I was watching this video of this
*  Couple that was infected and they were being dragged out of this building by these
*  Security guards in hazmat suits in china, you know, so the police or was that an exercise or was it real?
*  It was real. Yeah, because I saw it was uh,
*  I want to say it was a man and his wife that both tested positive
*  I don't remember though, but they were being dragged out. They're being like drag like like picking them up like they're
*  Like like they're criminals. I saw some videos. I don't know if it was just it just I don't know if it was just
*  It might have just been associated with corona or some other footage about seeing some stuff where motherfuckers like
*  They was pulling this one lady out and they fucking cracked her neck next. You know, she's on ice
*  Really? Yeah, I can't remember and I you know people are crazy on it and it might be somebody like
*  A story not related that but they changed the headlines get a different clickbait
*  Well when something catastrophic starts happening and people start dying people justify a lot of crazy shit, man
*  And one of the things that I bet people will justify is they'll they'll justify manhandling people
*  That they think are not complying with the rules or people that have the virus and then
*  Shit could get a real crazy if that becomes normal
*  It is going to become normal because you think about it like right now when you have cases of people getting frustrated somebody. Um,
*  It's yo you inside my body's on my social distance and this is when people everybody's not even out of here joke
*  Is this in new york?
*  Why is this person getting dragged off? Whatever wearing a mask? Oh, he won't wear a mask
*  So they're just dragging them off because he's not complying. Yeah. Yeah fucking crazy man
*  Because they're all closer and yeah, this is crazy
*  This is great
*  But it also is crazy that this guy doesn't think he should wear a mask when he's on a fucking bus crowded filled with people
*  While there's a pandemic disease going on he should have a fucking mask on
*  So where's the where's the happy middle?
*  The happy middle is not these cops grabbing this guy and physically yanking him off the bus and causing
*  this
*  You know very violent moment. I mean, I think the thing we need to figure more more important with that is like
*  Put your mask on son. Yeah, he didn't have a mask. Maybe he just didn't have it
*  Yeah, we mean to make that masks available to you don't want to lose your life
*  Yeah, but you don't want to see people on the bus
*  They're probably very happy that the cops came and pulled that guy off to lose your mask
*  Everybody's got a mask and this guy doesn't to lose your life
*  For a fucking mask. Yeah mask rules everything around me. Well, there's a terrible video of a bus driver in chicago
*  and um
*  He makes this video talking about people were on his bus just coughing and constantly coughing with their mouth open. He's like, please
*  He's like we're out here risking our health to do this service
*  And you know you people are being completely
*  Disrespectful and not caring and four days later. He got it and now he's dead
*  so this guy
*  He's in this video and then a short time afterwards. He's dead
*  For what he was talking about
*  I've heard so many cases of that dude. Imagine all of a sudden you're but you're a bus driver
*  And instead of just driving a bus now, you're also
*  Worried you're gonna die from a pandemic disease and you have to keep going to work and being surrounded by these people because someone has to
*  drive people around
*  They're not getting on the buses no more bro. No, what was that? Get on the bus
*  They're not gonna bus
*  When does this start back up and what is it gonna be like don now?
*  Like what is it gonna be like when the gears get going again that they start clink clink?
*  it's gonna be it's gonna look like
*  Uh the international
*  uh
*  terminal
*  For fly korea in uh, japan that's what's gonna look like motherfuckers gonna be on mask for a while
*  Yeah, I think you're probably they're gonna be masked up for a while. How long you think a year?
*  Yeah, I mean you got to
*  being able to test
*  Vaccine
*  How you get rid of it?
*  You know, they're gonna teach me how not to catch it
*  Okay, I got it how I get rid of it and I was watching one of those shows on cnn
*  With this black doctor and she was talking about how
*  They are close to a vaccine or something because they're just extending
*  I guess certain tests they were doing something else that had similar traits. I'm not a doctor. I don't know exactly
*  the story but it was a story of
*  they the
*  Study and a research of it had already started
*  Also, they had already been making the vaccine for the other stuff. Yeah, was it sars? Is that what it was?
*  It wasn't sars. It was some one of the new virus
*  I never heard of but it was an interesting story because she was
*  um, I don't know was goop or whatever the motherfucker is what it was but um
*  It was a great conversation like what if
*  Okay, we had they not we had but
*  Had realized that something like this is about to happen
*  Because of this strand of something this is going to be the next hercules shit
*  How do we get ahead of it? And there may be some people out there that um had already been thinking that they're going to find something to
*  Cure the shit. Well, they've definitely been thinking that this could happen because they're not a I know may sound crazy certain shit is like
*  I don't know what has got the world so involved now. It wasn't specific to a race or anything
*  Like like like they say in the streets anybody could catch it anybody could catch it, you know
*  Yeah, that's the panic and that's what that's where the panic is
*  In every community the whole world the whole world the whole world covered with humans. Everybody's got it
*  It's on every in every continent
*  Except anartica, I think an art because the only place doesn't have cases. That's what's wild about human contact and you think about
*  How a disease can so quickly spread from china just to the west of the world
*  And then it can be spread from china just all over the whole world and shut everything down
*  They said that if china was honest about it, I don't know if this is true
*  But this is what I was reading in more than one different story that china could have stopped 95 of the spread
*  They were just honest about it in the beginning and I know and they say if donald trump was honest about it
*  They could have set in mandates for social distancing and everything a little earlier
*  I think a lot of people were real skeptical. Unfortunately, a lot of people were real skeptical and
*  No one no one anticipated it happening like this
*  They were giving him a hard time when he was saying that they should stop travel from china
*  People were calling him racist now everybody stopped travel from everywhere
*  Yeah
*  But they want a lot of people want to call him racist for fucking goddamn anything if he just say coffee with no sugar
*  Whoa, see, this is the reason why I don't want to fuck with this motherfucker
*  Well, you know, it's it gets clapped the things get cloudy, right?
*  Because like what is the thing the thing is he wants to stop travel from this place because of diseases in this place
*  And then the reaction is well, that's racist to say and we should be more sensitive
*  And this is yeah, but people don't understand that donald trump don't move off of emotions
*  The things that he's saying is that you got to understand that certain people build like this certain people
*  Don't make decisions off of emotions, right?
*  And that's what so many people get connected and disconnected with a can and whatever. It's like yeah
*  I fucking root it for him like they get connected with the emotions
*  And then certain people like him and people of that like mine, which are mostly business people
*  They don't fuck with emotions. They only fuck with results. It's like oh, I feel sorry. Did you think about I bitch?
*  I don't care about none of that. That's not how I work
*  But what my point was that if you got to give the guy a hard time about not reacting quick enough to certain things
*  You also got to give him
*  Props for shutting down traffic to places early
*  But nobody wants to do that because it's a weird one because the people that don't want to do that
*  Joe is the ones that are caught up in the emotion the ideology. Some people do not get
*  Dealed with reality, right?
*  Their reality and not on the trunk not trying to harp on the trump shit, but isiah washington, you know, is that washington? Yes
*  Uh, graze anatomy with a good friend of mine known him from years in brooklyn whatever. He's a um, he's like a
*  Like what are you a trump supporter? He's like a loyal trump supporter. You know, I mean, he's a he's a he's a he's a
*  Supports trump, but i've heard him say he said I don't vote for a person. I vote for policies
*  I vote for policies and i'll give you an example
*  Well, this is a weird one down now because no one had ever experienced this before
*  So no one's doing the right thing haven't experienced pandemics. That's shut down the whole world
*  So when he when anyone's doing anything right now, everyone's going to be criticized
*  But you gotta do like like what people don't like, um
*  I listen i'll watch both outlets fox
*  And cnn that's confusing. Isn't it? It's confusing but cnn just where yeah cnn is like
*  A nagging girlfriend. It's like oh bitch. Shut the fuck up
*  It's same shit, bitch. Yo joe you like seeing it have you like bitch?
*  Oh, you don't got nothing else to argue about five years ago
*  You haven't found another argument cnn's me like uh-uh you remember that time you remember that time
*  Fox be like bitch listen, you know i'm saying like you listen to if you listen to too much cnn, bro
*  You don't even know what the fuck is going on with nothing
*  Other than how much you hate this motherfucker didn't used to be that way. I know cnn used to be pretty straight journalism
*  Yeah, but now their relationship with trump is so toxic for both of them. It's so it's so for both of them
*  It's so I want to get you back. It's so like girl. Let me get you back
*  girl
*  It's so papa's chicken girl. You go with lebanese and spices girl
*  It's so and like when I saw that the point i'm making is like
*  But when I listen when I listen to both because you want to hear both perspectives if you care really care
*  You listen to both but then when I go to fox and listen to it. I at least hear
*  Okay, this is what our plans are. This is what we want to do
*  This is what the plans are. This is what the president says he's going to do
*  This is what the government wants to do you go on the other side all you hear is like
*  1000 people more more people die die die die. That's all you hear is numbers and numbs
*  You don't have no solution
*  And then the problem is joe people get fucked up on how they want your solution conveyed to them. It's like
*  Can you give it to me?
*  Slow joe, can you have vaseline with it or are you going to be rough with me?
*  And they can't take a motherfucker's that motherfuckers can't handle rough. I'm gonna get I'll put it like this, right?
*  I'm gonna get my democrat, right?
*  And I love being a democrat until tax season
*  You know how close I was to putting the make america great again when it was time to file my taxes son
*  Yo, but the point i'm making and I I i'm probably an example for a lot of people
*  I'm a small business
*  You know
*  I'm a vet
*  I'm a veteran
*  I served the united states air force. I did my times. I don't they're gonna say how good of a airman I was
*  But I committed four years of my life to this country
*  You know i'm saying and if there's it is not about let's take away the shit about
*  Uh, but the way he made me feel and then he said that he's such a so so
*  Let's let's take away that in in my situation. There's a lot of people that are i'm a small business and i'm a vet
*  And the things that he do for those type of people it's easy for me
*  To say I I could justify if all i'm thinking about is money and paper I could justify
*  Yeah, fuck them because of that
*  but it's people the
*  Disconnection right now with this election. I feel is that everybody has
*  They're using everybody's stakes is on emotions
*  It's all on how I feel. Oh, I like this guy like that guy like this guy whatever, you know
*  This is like this motherfucker was going to come into this election and just beat the shit out of
*  anybody
*  The economy was doing well, you know what i'm saying the pond and the whole my whole thing was with anybody getting upset
*  Joe
*  What are you going to fight this motherfucker with this time? You don't have no more fighting styles
*  Yeah, well being pissed there
*  It's not good for anybody it's definitely not good for him. It's not good for them, but
*  It's that's what sells
*  Like this battle sells the battle sells this is a you know when all this dust settles
*  We're going to reevaluate so many different things about our culture because we're going to realize how temporary this civilization we put together really is
*  Especially if we hit a great depression after this we don't bounce back
*  To things you get real ugly for a lot of people
*  You know that they're going to feel very misled and mismanaged and mishandled
*  I don't think that's my personal thing. That's gonna be a case like dealing with this again. Not a doctor professor anything that but it's more
*  Technology involved these days. There's more of a possibility
*  That of making profit off of this and you know how when you can make money off of something how people feel about that
*  Just like you was telling me about the test the situation like you know
*  It's like do you do you have you had to like some motherfuckers don't even know where to begin
*  And the reason why I don't know where to begin because I think it's because I think it's because I think it's because I think it's because
*  Okay, because what they tell you joe what they tell you they say don't come up in this motherfucking hospital or whatever
*  unless you
*  Feel a little fucked up right you know i'm saying like
*  Everybody doesn't have the benefits that you have you know what I mean and this is no disrespect to anything
*  So what happens how do I so what they're trying to say is?
*  Uh, I gotta be sick before I go see that's some people's reality
*  You know some people like this oh don't go check you know i'm saying
*  but what this shit is going to
*  Switch over we're gonna we're gonna not switch over, but we're gonna start having
*  a level of confidence and that's going to be because
*  We're gonna handle this shit quick. This is what I think we're gonna make people understand
*  We need a certain amount of health coverage for 100% for everybody and this is this is a perfect example that
*  100% because the more people get sick from this the more everyone else is going to get sick too the more people get sick
*  Anything joe like anything like I keep saying it
*  I keep saying that the the thing that's going to enlighten everybody and understand about this
*  It's like I know you don't want to get the covey, but while you try not to get covey
*  You're stopping a lot of shit. Yes, you're stopping a lot of shit goes back to you talking about diet and everything
*  Yeah, and that's why like they're like in the black community like oh it's hitting hard
*  motherfuckers
*  Come on man like we talked about this before nobody
*  Wants to deal with fucking reality and the reality be right in your fucking face
*  The reality is always our face joe. I think the large number of people that live like that donel
*  It's just a symptom of this crazy society now that this has been shook up
*  I think a lot of people are going to reevaluate they're going to think about the things that are putting them the week. You know what?
*  the um
*  I believe this
*  The weak people are going to get weaker and a strong, but I think something like this weak people get weaker
*  Yeah, and strong people get stronger
*  It could happen or weak people can figure out that what they're doing could really end their life
*  And that they've been fucking up and they need to step up and then they'll step up now because they realize that this is all
*  But you could be weaker you could be weak and smart at the same time
*  Sure, there's a lot of people like that that are really intelligent
*  But they don't have control of their emotions or they don't have the control of their discipline
*  That's real common discipline is the number one. That's a big one. It's a big one. It's
*  What gets things done?
*  It's the thing that gets things done more consistently than anything is discipline and nobody's going to ever nobody's not too often
*  You can hear somebody say this joe
*  Why didn't it happen? They're gonna be like, oh, yeah, I was young
*  They're not nobody not too many people gonna say
*  And it comes down to I wasn't disciplined enough
*  That's what's so fucked up about this crisis is that there's people that were doing the right thing
*  They were disciplined and still they get their livelihood taken away from them and then they get their health taken away from them
*  They did the right thing. That's what's so crazy. Yeah, that's that's what's never happened to us before
*  and that's what
*  it's so it's not funny, but um
*  that's what when it comes to uh
*  Even death, you know like when somebody
*  You hear about somebody dying and you were close to them or you know a story of them or something
*  Now when people die you hear this right here. Um
*  Oh shit
*  We lost a good one today like the other days we lost those guys. They weren't good ones
*  You know, it's like out of all these deaths like this one today. Oh, we lost a good one
*  Oh, there's sometimes when someone dies that you're like a fan of like prince or david bowie or bill withers when bill withers died real recently
*  it's like oh
*  Live at carnagie hall. I know
*  That guy was that song used me. I mean, come on man
*  You ever heard a song great song that song. Um, you are my friend
*  Yeah, one of us has to say he's sorry or we could never be friends again
*  I say some things that cost you sorrow
*  I just want you as my friend
*  We're here today and gone tomorrow
*  None of us knows where life will end
*  That song man live at carnagie hall and i'm gonna tell you the thing I dug about bill withers the most
*  Me being a comedian and loving music, you know, I don't know everything about music
*  But like if you heard his live at carnagie hall album
*  the transitions
*  from one
*  Song to the next you would appreciate if you haven't heard it joe the comedic timing of it
*  Listening to the crowd. You know what i'm saying? Like, you know what? I mean like the storytelling of it
*  It's like like his little husk and the things he would say was all on point
*  He he took a crap that's suspense to build up the joke and then going back to I love that when he introduced grandma's hand
*  He said grandma used to go to church and it wasn't one of them churches where you go and you say if you're loving jesus
*  It's all right. He said no no no
*  No
*  He said grandma went to one of them churches where the beat started getting to you and you get them that
*  Well to that stove you say oh
*  That was grandma church then he said I love that old lady
*  I love that old lady
*  Grandma's hands. Oh
*  Oh
*  If you haven't heard that album in a while and you know, it's classic and the thing about bill withers people don't know
*  The youngers and millenniums they don't know half the songs
*  The remakes whatever half the shit they get connected with came from him. Yeah
*  I imagine I wonder how much
*  Come on if he was on the um
*  line of richie level of royalties
*  Or whatever, but this fucking album right here. How about lean on me boom boom boom lean song
*  You know what I tell you I use that song as the background theme
*  For my roasting of charlotte main to god
*  Yo, I just want to say I have theme song for this motherfucker joe. Yo, yo I have theme songs some
*  Times in our life. I I pray for him
*  Because I slaughter him son. Why why do you guys go at it so hard? I don't understand. I'm
*  You brought it up I didn't bring it up joe i'll explain it up early, but I brought it up about explaining i'll explain joe
*  I'll explain it to you joe
*  I'll explain it to you joe

*  Joe joe listen, this was a day of frustration right here. Okay. I've known this crew for some years joe
*  Angela ye go back 20 years dj envy go back 15. We used to do hot 97 together
*  Then I used to go up there i'm up there so much because I work at carolines on broadway, you know, that's where you promote it
*  So I go up did it they started this thing where they want to play pranks on me, right? Like oh we got him
*  You know one prank was um when he comes in no one laughs at his jokes. All right
*  Right this one
*  Look, it's like this one of them is like this joe when he comes in don't laugh at his jokes, right? So i'll go in
*  And I ain't trying to be funny i'm just funny and nobody laughs or anything and i'm like joe i'm thinking like this i'm like
*  I know I know the fix is on joe
*  Joe I know
*  You were suspicious
*  Joe something's wrong joe
*  Have you ever seen me in a room?
*  And nobody's laughing
*  I can't say that no, okay. That's pretty much everywhere I go
*  I'm just being honest. So you know, you're funny. I know i'm funny but not only that but my energy even if i'm not funny
*  My energy is is good. I came in they trying to play
*  And i'm like, oh i'm about to tear everybody up in this room. I'm like, I don't hit women but ye
*  I'm gonna hit you with something right?
*  And they like ah, we told him not to laugh. I'm like, okay
*  A little corny joke three or four other times I go there. They keep doing these jokes and i'm like stop doing the motherfucking jokes
*  like
*  I know we're friends or whatever. But at the same time I
*  Do have a resume
*  I have done stuff
*  I'll continue to do stuff
*  As much as they want to play this is the reality of it. Do you feel like it's disrespectful? No, it's a disrespectful way like
*  Anything you you try to call me not funny. You see me stand up 6500 people in radio city music hall
*  Charlamagne you said out of your voice
*  that donnell
*  Um, I went to see radio city music hall
*  Uh chris rock dave chappelle and donnell performed that night
*  He said I love all of them and I ain't taking away nothing. He said but donnell that night was on
*  You saw that nigga
*  You saw all this shit. So you trying to say you corny
*  Which is an allergic word to a black comedian you corny like no you trying to give the impression that i'm corny and not funny
*  It's just a waste of time and it don't make sense
*  So now that we get little joke stuff off
*  now
*  Give me a real interview
*  You know, I mean that's the only thing I say give me a real interview, okay
*  Did you does he know you feel like this you ever talked to him off the air?
*  Yeah, we talked about it. But this what i'm saying is but this is how petty he is. Okay
*  He this is the this is the part this reason why I won't stop
*  Because he won't stop right he'll say I've I've expressed myself to him like this. He said
*  That's why I like playing with you nigga. You're too sensitive, right?
*  So we go back for us. Okay, fuck it. Let's go back
*  Well, and like we've had the conversation but what I realized joe is that
*  It doesn't matter what I say. He's never going to give it, you know, he's never going to do it
*  So what I have to do is continue to destroy him
*  On the level that I need to destroy him in
*  the memes i'm
*  Ruthless i've seen them and people are like I thought it was a inside fun joke though. I didn't know it was so serious
*  No, it's serious and it's funny. Okay
*  Joe
*  Everything is always underlining
*  Everything is always something under like it's like no we're cool. But uh, so it's never you never feel comfortable
*  Can't just hang I like them
*  And the reason oh, I like we'll have fun together. I have said
*  to him
*  You know why I said I know why you think you're a sex symbol and you look good
*  I said because I was in south columbia this weekend, right?
*  And I said you are the best looking person in south columbia you should feel like a king
*  We fuck with each other like that, but also know
*  His radio background i'll never take this away from him. This is where we differ his radio background
*  That's coming from south columbia. You know how it is getting radio break going from market like south columbia to new york new york
*  It's the number one radio market
*  period
*  You go from that from a pa or intern whatever entry level position you had
*  You go from that and you build and you grind and you're a country motherfucker
*  You're a country motherfucker and you and now you're charlotte man of god. He works hard and he says does that podcast with andrew schultz, too
*  Yeah, they do it. What is that brilliant idiots?
*  That's a very good podcast. I'm a i'm a person of this two of them together. They are they great. I'm a person like this joe
*  If you're doing it, I can't hate on that you're doing it. You do a really good job at it you
*  You're doing late night and all that type of shit. I respect that
*  but it
*  Stopped with the same you can't clown me
*  You can't clown me i'm not a
*  you
*  You can't clown me you're giving people asses for
*  christmas presents
*  Giving people asses you didn't notice joe. No
*  Joe you didn't notice I didn't know this what the fuck are you doing man? Just busy doing other stuff
*  Oh, yeah, we went through this again, right?
*  I forgot we went through this was spitting 16 too. I'm sorry. I didn't mean this is different like giving no no fake ass
*  Now you okay. Can I play in this scenario? Yeah before you see this video, okay?
*  Right, and i'm not trying to say anybody's gay, but sometimes people are real comfortable
*  Comfortable real comfortable. Okay, if jamie were to come in here like this and be like
*  Oh joe good to see you man. I haven't seen you since holly. I got a gift for you. You'd be like thanks jamie. That's nice
*  You open the box and you open that box and you open it and then as jamie gave you this as a gift
*  Okay, here we go. Let's open it. Let's see
*  What is this
*  Now this is friends
*  Is that a rubber ass
*  What is that look joe?
*  Oh, he made a mold of his ass, right? Oh, okay. That's funny that
*  That's kind of funny
*  By how long for a little bit you know along like just as a ridiculous thing
*  Amy goes and put his finger in the booty hole
*  Well, you know you do what you gotta do you want to get what the fuck are you talking about man? I don't care really
*  Okay. All right. All right, you're comfortable. You would be comfortable black ash black ass
*  Well, oh look at the balls. I didn't know about the balls. What the fuck maybe this is the wrong show
*  So is that would you do is that an exact mold or did you just like give him a picture?
*  See see see see joe like you went porn star to do that here it is
*  You know that that's what they do and guess what joe and this is what I try to say
*  You really appreciate it. That's white boy humor right there. You love that joe. It's not my favorite thing
*  It's not your favorite. I'm not gonna lie to you. It's not my favorite thing. It's not your favorite thing
*  But that's a humor you can respect
*  I can't respect that
*  That's what that's what you're telling me like dude. I t-bag dude my whole life
*  There no I have never done that but what they're doing is okay, that's unnecessary exactly unnecessary and rude and this um, okay
*  And no one likes it like that. Anyway, oh my god. Oh my god. This is the setup
*  That's the thing that with porn stars man
*  They they get paid to get like molds of their body and then dudes so you're trying to say charlotte maine is a porn star
*  That's how they make those. I don't know why there's a hole. Okay, joe
*  I don't know how the fuck they made that one
*  But don't bring it to my interview and don't keep putting it in my fucking face. Is that fair donnell?
*  Just think about this. Why is there a hole?
*  If it's a mold of your ass
*  The only reason why there's a hole is they put it there
*  They put a place where you can stick something in exactly joe and the point i'm making joe is that that's not what you gift
*  Your mans, I understand that same as you said, I understand your position
*  I know you're gonna know how to break it down the whole ass and the anal cavity
*  I wouldn't do it. You know that type shit. That's not what i'm saying
*  And then would you be sketchy of a guy and then what are they gonna fill it up with cream?
*  What is that? They're polishing it. Look look that's dj envy. He's got a family joe
*  He's got a family joe
*  No, he's got a family and a dope son. That's good. Like jim envy's a great father
*  He's got a family there go for it. Once you already got the party rolling your finger in a rubber butt
*  Come on, man. Come on, man with cocoa butter. I'm not i'm not mad. I'm not mad
*  So you don't think you don't okay now, okay, I wouldn't want that so I wouldn't here's the thing
*  I wouldn't want to give me that I wouldn't want to be there
*  I wouldn't want to have to deal with it when I got you don't want to be around the type of motherfuckers
*  I think I don't want to be fingering it. No, I don't
*  No down now you're going understanding my point. I understand the point i'm making is that I know that's your thing
*  The booty stuff a little you guys have fun, you know, like y'all y'all have fun doing it
*  I am not of that place or space. You're not into fingering rubber butts in front of people on camera
*  Not at all and then they went back and forth son
*  They went back and forth like to keep doing the corny jokes and the last time I went up there
*  I knew I already knew what he was going to do. They're gonna try to do a joke
*  You know those horns they take to soccer matches
*  Yeah
*  I went to the breakfast club
*  With a bag full of them motherfuckers

*  I knew you would like that part more than anything. I clipped up on his ass
*  I was using windage. You know what windage is on the gun, right?

*  Uh, that looks like uh, you photoshopped charlomane's face. I didn't photoshop charlomane shit. That was him son
*  The same it's a terrible photoshop. Look at that jamie. That's not a terrible photoshop. He's got a maga hat on you got the message

*  Yeah, but I will say people ask and the thing about everywhere I go people like yo the breakfast club
*  They'd be fucking with you son. They'd be fucking with you son
*  So I just wanted you think there's a way to do a show
*  Like within the next month where are you gonna test everybody? Are you gonna produce it?
*  No, no, no, I mean like a comedy show because the last time you said you was gonna
*  And i'm not i'm the last time you said you mean podcast. Yeah last time you said because like
*  No, that's not what you said joe
*  No, no what you tried to force me into doing was I didn't try to force you anything
*  I feel like he did jamie. Did I force him into anything jamie? I
*  No, i'm not saying i'm not trying it's just but I can't blow your spot up
*  But you you said I didn't force you said you was producing the first episode. I said I would do it
*  I said I'll produce it and jamie was not excited about it at all
*  He wouldn't even take the shit off my phone, but jamie was doing something with you, right?
*  No, he didn't it wasn't he didn't do it on purpose the issue. I was trying to I was trying to bluetooth
*  I was trying to um, airdrop the episode that I did in the car
*  So jamie was producing it so he said it but you know, he started not taking my calls also. Is that what happened?
*  Yo
*  What happened? I didn't hit you on something definitely we did jamie. I didn't get off the ground
*  Oh 100 that's why I can't take this. What did you do? You put it up for him you uploaded it for no
*  We got he sent me the video and then
*  We got the video and then a whole bunch of stuff happened that day like including the podcast of the resna
*  We were supposed to get a song from resna, which you got I think right? Yeah. Yeah, I got the beat
*  He never sent it to me the beat. How was I supposed to put it on that video? I didn't know you was
*  well
*  So we felt like this was going to be more work than we anticipated. I knew it. I knew it
*  I knew it's jamie didn't want to do it as soon as he shows that I mean
*  That kind of stuff where he's got to like figure out how to put the bead on the
*  You know if I don't know why you guys didn't communicate properly
*  We did he wasn't playing with me joe joe. He wasn't fucking with me joe. I don't believe that when I walked to the side
*  He always responds. What happened jamie? I don't want to say it on air. Oh, that's all I'll remind you guys off air
*  He doesn't want to call you out
*  No, when I went over there jamie started breathing hard when I went over he was like
*  He was like this is what you said jamie i'm telling you said you looked at a little that little scroll line you did like this
*  Your eyes blink bro. You did like this. You said it's not it's going to take too long. All right, here's what happened
*  Now i'm remembering it again. Okay in the middle of
*  We had we'd finished your podcast and we started the next one with rizza
*  I have to do stuff in the middle of doing two podcasts. That's what I didn't know during that you came up to me and started
*  Not making me but asking me to help you right?
*  I had to get the next podcast ready and I had no idea at the same time you were I was trying to communicate with
*  You how to use airdrop and you weren't on the wi-fi weren't on the bluetooth
*  And that's the best way to get the video to me and we were trying to figure out if you could do that or a drop box
*  So jamie, you didn't hear me say this you didn't hear me say this jamie this part of the story
*  You didn't hear me say this jamie jamie
*  I don't want to upset you. What do I need to do to make this uh, this situation easier for you? I never said that
*  We got we got that part figured out though. Yeah, but that was the first thing but see I didn't know the urgency of
*  I'm was here goes my narcissistic attitude. I was it's all I was thinking about me
*  And I didn't think about you had another show so you were 100% right
*  I thought I contacted jamie and jamie told me that you got somebody else to do it then like who else
*  David's helping you now, right? Yeah, I did it because somebody wouldn't answer my fucking phone call. It wasn't me
*  Okay. All right. It got done. But here's the thing and like you i'm happier up and running
*  That's what i'm saying
*  like I could never be mad at that situation because
*  That was the kick in the ass for me to do it. You know what i'm saying? And like the fact that
*  like that day
*  I it was it was the birth of it. You know i'm saying like that day
*  Was so special to me, you know, I mean I didn't want to be at the risa podcast
*  I told you I was like I just got the flight haven't seen my son in a while
*  Right. I said I was like fuck you was like the risa. I was like, yeah, nigga. I said, yeah
*  I just called you nigga. I said, yeah, nigga, but my son I ain't seen my son
*  I got a red eye, right and remember that and I was like right before before I was gonna leave you asked me
*  You said you sure I was like nigga. I go see my son, right?
*  I love wu-tang, but I gotta see my son and I walk out the door i'm about to leave i'm dipping in the car
*  fucking risa pull up
*  And the first thing he said was what's up ashy larry you funny motherfucker
*  Hey joe, I said man, fuck my son nigga. That's the risa wu-tang forever
*  My son don't even look like me nigga. I'm good. I'm about to interrupt the shit out of this, son
*  That's what happened. So if it was if I was out of pocket
*  I'm gonna tell you because I would not I would never been on no shit like you better do this. I was
*  Nigga anybody america to kill y'all understand joe rogan and jamey said they're gonna produce my first podcast
*  Rizzo come through the fucking door saying i'm gonna give you a track
*  That's a lot of things that happen today
*  That's a lifetime motherfucker
*  Joe rogan just endorsed my shit. Jamie said that risa came in bong bong trying to be a comedian
*  And
*  And he said he's gonna give me a beat
*  I was like man when we went to that podcast I was on fucking cloud nine, bro
*  When you do your podcast, what are you doing it twice a week? How many days a week?
*  I do it it all depends like
*  twice
*  Uh twice I do one one. Sometimes I do two
*  Sometimes I do one it all depends on how I feel if I think I can whatever you feel like doing
*  Yeah, nice. Yeah, I love it. I'm telling you i'm whenever you feel it man joe. I'm gonna tell you something
*  From that day, I will be forever grateful for that conversation, you know
*  because it put me on a path of like like
*  everybody
*  everybody
*  That starts this business. They want to be you
*  They want to be you when they start they don't look at the steps joe
*  They don't look at the steps. The only thing they see is you now
*  You got some loyal fans
*  But when it comes to being somebody being introduced to the game or whatever
*  You're the grail you're like I want to nigga
*  You can't just do that motherfucker
*  You got to fight for that shit. You got to go through a whole bunch of you can't do that
*  But what you could say is like I want to have the work ethics of that motherfucker have
*  That's that's everything that's everything doing it and I'm telling you if you you keep doing it you get better at it
*  That's when I first started when I was stressed you said I was sensitive
*  Because I didn't know that I i'm not in control of the podcast world. I'm in control of a stage
*  Yeah, if I go on the stage nigga you come at me i'm gonna tear your ass up
*  You come at me with the trolley shit or whatever. I don't know
*  I don't know how to act there's some new shit
*  And then as I when I first started doing it, I never promised anything anything anybody crazy
*  I was like it's gonna evolve and even the people that i'm working when I said listen, man
*  It's a learning process. I said but every week
*  We got to grow every week got to be something different if we have our sound was kind of shaky
*  The week before next week, we can't have that sound issue. Of course, we're gonna make mistakes
*  But we can't repeat the same mistakes. That's when it gets to be a nuisance. Let's grow
*  Let's grow in terms of the mic the posters
*  Everything yeah, it's every it's like everything else man. Just more more you think about it more
*  You can improve it the more you think about what you did that maybe you could have done better
*  It's not ever done like i'll have a bad podcast to this day
*  Sometimes it just doesn't click or i'm off or my brain's not firing that good. It's gonna happen
*  No way around it, but if they dig you they're tuning to find out well they they kind of could tell
*  Someone listens to you for so many hours. They kind of get it
*  It's just like there's some days like any other human being there's some days like physically
*  You don't feel as good as you feel other days. You want your rundown your brain doesn't work that way
*  Or well that rather that way either when you're run down your brain doesn't work. Well, it's like sometimes i'm just not as sharp or
*  sloppy or
*  Maybe i'm not as enthusiastic as I should be maybe not tuned in as much like it's all about being tuned in man
*  I did and i've had something and it's so funny said because every time i've done an episode, right?
*  I'm like this, you know when I get off stage, I know when I ripped you know, you like, oh
*  Yeah, i'll do a podcast and i'm like, uh, i'm like did anybody see a scorecard right? I'm like like i'm like this joe
*  I'm like, yeah not you know how to muffle like this and you like this like and still like oh, yeah
*  And but for some reason those moments i'm like, oh, I don't know
*  Because it's hard. I can't be critical of myself when i'm talking. It's hard man, you know, I gotta I can't think
*  But the times I thought it was going to be like whatever was some of the best it felt good man. It felt really good
*  And this shit feel good from nobody everybody talk about you on the reason podcast that gave me four beats, bro
*  And I didn't cut this beat up into all type of shit. So I got commercials
*  I got ass ass. I got the remix
*  This one fucking beat is so dope. Do you see the thing with him and dj premier?
*  Yeah, I was I was in and out of it. How interesting is that?
*  It's interesting. That's a great way to like make something out of all this, you know what joe?
*  I'm glad you brought that up, right? Because that's the new thing. Everything is the versus thing now joe, right the battle
*  And then people like even with that what people were like this
*  They said um who won and in a battle like that
*  Everybody won everybody won everybody won hip-hop won you also people won because
*  You're watching it while it's happening and these guys are having a good time
*  Knowing that all these people are getting into it online and it's all going down on your phone
*  So it's all everything is this completely new thing from top to bottom the quarantine is completely new
*  The fact that rizza and dj premier, dude, i'm a huge gangstar fan
*  I've loved gangstar from a long time ago. That's like
*  Real rap and that's what was so dope about this
*  And this is the point that I was trying to make on the rizzo joint. I was talking about uh
*  Like one of the things that i'm impressed about rizzo and I know people like this you didn't let rizzo talk really rizzo talk whatever
*  but I felt like
*  motherfuckers say the same
*  Same shit same same shit. I know it's his voice to say it but i'm like anything else that we do we know
*  About rizzo and i'm more impressed on being able to create a group as as iconic
*  As wu-tang is that's it
*  And to be able to say you know what not saying it was the strife or anything is like i'm a bad motherfucker
*  I can flip genres. I can do whatever i'm gonna show another white writing style
*  So that's one of the things that I personally respected about
*  Him and his journey they built
*  One of the most iconic bands in all of music
*  Because it's the black grateful dead or what did you tell me fish or some shit? No fish is a copy of the grateful dead
*  They would have to be when I say that a band that can tour forever. Yeah forever
*  There's something but there's something about them. It's like
*  What they stand for is strong, you know, is that expression that the sum is greater than its parts?
*  So like you counted up all them together
*  All right
*  Together they just work perfectly. I'll be right back. All right
*  All right, who's talking that motherfucking joke?
*  All right, i'm good, they were all so original too and you know
*  And odb when odb went big that was part of their master plan though, right?
*  What odb? Yeah when he was when he was doing that baby, I got your money song. Come on, man
*  It's still to this day when you hear that song. That's one of my all-time favorite songs. That's a happy song
*  But it's like
*  And he was like, you know odb was odb. Yeah, like when i'm i'm
*  The only thing that I liked about what your fans said said the nickname they gave me because they was giving me wu-te names
*  After that shit, right? They called me the old dirty interrupter
*  Right, and I was like this. I had to give a thumbs up on that one said they called me the old dirty interrupter
*  And that shit and the thing about it was that shit the dirty interrupter it blew up so much
*  RZA
*  Hit us up but they were doing a 25 year loud and loud loud
*  25 year loud record anniversary at radio city music hall wu-te whole bunch of groups, right?
*  and uh
*  RZA reached out to us and he wanted us to do a video to introduce
*  The wu-te on stage
*  Me and dave was um, we were uh
*  Me and dave were we were uh touring we were somewhere
*  And we did a video and they played it ready to the music hall and the video was like yo dave was like yo
*  What's up radio cities music hall? Did you see me coming? Let me say something. Let me say did you ever see it?
*  No, oh man. It was a great ass moment, man
*  And as much as people want to shit on me about he ruined the podcast
*  Just and I know most of it was the energy dave had but that little connection came through I was like you
*  Motherfuckers didn't woke up a beast
*  You know, you ever be so mad joe it make you go do something. Wait a minute. I have seen this video
*  I have seen it. Yeah, it's like a selfie camera. Yeah, it's a selfie camera. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, that's right
*  You know and they played that while the concert was going on and then he
*  Then it was like man it was fire, you know that I know it probably didn't even
*  Make page six or whatever, but it was like to know that
*  That is a part of my life
*  You know i'm saying those relationships
*  It was it's just fucking dope man like
*  Rizzy gave me a beat nigga
*  Come on man, it's pretty impressive yo
*  My yo risen gave me a beat shout out to my whole crew julius and that's what you use for the podcast opener, right?
*  Yeah, but it's like
*  The intros I did like co-opens but and I don't want to be like overly producing anything
*  But i've established something with the intros where they I think people kind of look forward to like
*  How this will play?
*  Not knowing what you know, yeah
*  For sure
*  It's just you're just able to express yourself so easily there when you do something like that where no one has any input
*  It's just you to them
*  It's like you're basically doing a lot of what you do when you do radio shows. Anyway, you just do it to the whole world
*  Yeah
*  Yeah, it's just you rant for the whole world and you don't know the hardest part is like you don't know they're listening yet
*  You got a way. Yeah, that's true. You got to wait for the response on stage. You knew that shit was whack or not
*  Yeah, it's a just it's just a different thing
*  But it's like a different thing to focus on it's been fun
*  It's been so dope
*  and now and it's like with with the cove 19 and everything is like
*  I really have time to put into and i'm having i'm really
*  I'm really having fun doing it. It's fun. That's beautiful, man
*  It's it is all about finding something to occupy your time that you enjoy
*  That's a big part of what life's all about
*  What i'm hoping this does too for people once the dust settles and the economy starts to bounce back
*  I'm hoping people when they go forward they're going to make choices based on what they want to do what they really want to what they
*  Really are excited by what they're going to enjoy not on what they think is the safest the safest option
*  Not on what they think they have to long term. They have to now because they're feeling what's important
*  Yeah, they're fearing they have to they're feeling it. So it's like
*  What do we do? What do we do? What do we do? What do we do? Why is that me?
*  What do we do? Why do you when you do an impression of me? Why do you say what do you what do we do?
*  Because everything is not all the time, but I know what do we do, but it's not just what do we do
*  It's like a movement. What do we do? What do we do?
*  What do we do? What do we do? And why you what are we doing? You're telling us what what we need to do
*  But you you still say what do we what do we do because i'm never sure
*  But you don't you sound like and that's
*  You sound like you write about everything. You don't know to me motherfuckers. It sounds like that
*  I definitely don't sound like i'm right about everything. I'm wrong about a lot of shit
*  But i'm right about what you don't sound like it i'm right about what I think and then I know this is how I think
*  I'm pure in my intention. I'm not always correct. What do we do? What do we do? What do we do?
*  What do we do with intention? Joe? What do we do with attention?
*  What do we do? We ignore it. Do we ignore it? What do we do? Don't get sucked into your phone, baby
*  Don't get some comments. Don't do it. It's just time you can never get back
*  That's important. It's time you can never get back
*  You're too creative you're doing too much good shit you're doing too much funny shit
*  That bit that you posted up on the instagram the other day
*  I love that bit about how women love text messages because there's no way you would ever let them say that many words to your face
*  No, sir, you would not do it my first paragraph. It's like not today, bitch
*  Not today you're gonna save this for somebody else
*  Yeah when they're giving you this fucking one, two, three, four, five, six pages in a row like jeez
*  How many text messages are coming in are we reading to each other here and then sorry jamie
*  But they're all stocked up and then you hit k and they'll fucking lose themselves
*  K is hilarious k is a motherfucker and whatever someone's that's so passive aggressive. You don't even write. Okay, okay, just k
*  It's like I don't want to hear anything. It's like please. It's like it's like a please
*  You can kind of get away with k you can kind of get away with okay
*  But if you write like, you know, some people write a bunch of k's
*  Like if you do that, that's like you're like dismissing them right like okay. Okay. Okay, okay, but you can never stop at three k's
*  No three
*  You gotta go to four
*  You gotta keep going if you just like that message now instead of hitting k even if you just liked it
*  Yeah to that girl back is that that's weird man girls get upset at that like passing
*  Yeah, I feel like girls want they want you to write it back. Okay, sounds good. Thank you. Bye
*  They want you to say it back jamie. Nah, man
*  Just fucking like their thing because what if they have android
*  It says it it's a text message to them that says you like this message. It's fucking confusing
*  And I didn't like it. I just thumbed up because I don't have no middle options. That's how they keep us divided
*  Yeah, edwards is right android and apple. That's how they keep us divided. That's so the separation is real
*  That's so real man. Yeah, can't even airdrop me. I got that. What was that weed?
*  Good weed, right? That shit was I never had that from speed weed. It's all this is all speed weeds blunts. They're called loaded
*  Shout out to my man. Gino
*  Gino's always got that belt. I think he's always got the belt
*  He has a literally a bandolier like clint eastwood in an old western where there's these cartridges of blunts all around him
*  Yeah, man. It's hilarious. You're gonna keep that on
*  Now I just like it son in uh less than a half an hour
*  We're gonna find out whether or not you uh got the co vid
*  Got that rona
*  I wish we'd done it before
*  I don't know son. Well, let everybody know
*  How you feel you feel good? I feel great. That's the thing. That's the thing
*  that like
*  That's the thing that's gonna freak motherfuckers out like a motherfucker could feel great and not be great. You don't know
*  Yes, you know, that's what's scary about this disease is more than any other one how many people
*  Test positive but don't experience any symptoms
*  And then other people just die. It's like it is confusing for folks
*  Because I think they said there's some the number was between 50 and 70 percent, right?
*  They they test positive. They've come in contact with the virus. They have no symptoms at all
*  When do you think we're going to get back to normal
*  I don't think again joe is never going to be another normal. I think this is it now. Yeah, this is it
*  I just think that um, uh people are going to build a different, uh
*  Imagine if you graduate in high school and this is what happens is the world you're looking forward to
*  Motherfucker right when I get out or another thing you can think of like I was talking with my buddies and um
*  I've been having a really good time with um
*  my son making stuff
*  he said man, I know this may sound crazy, but
*  This corona shit he said you and your son will look back one day. You're gonna be like hey dad
*  Remember when we made that um slingshot during when the corona was out
*  Yeah, you know i'm saying it's like
*  And it's like, you know
*  The memory is going to be there all type of ways. Yeah, you're building memories that you wouldn't have ordinarily built
*  Yep, as long as you're alive and as long as you're healthy. It's just
*  it's I think
*  The positive side of this you can always look at the negative side
*  But the positive side is look how many people are complying look how many people are doing the right thing, right?
*  That's a lot of people a lot of people and they're they're doing the right thing because they care about their loved ones
*  But then people hopefully they care about your loved ones and people aren't complaining as much people not do like fucking
*  That's what I mean. Some people are hurting financially a lot of people losing their businesses. They're hurting
*  But the amount of strife the amount that you see in the streets as far as like riots and protests
*  It's not existent people are understanding. We're all fucked. This is like we didn't see it coming. We all got a deal
*  I just hope this makes people realize
*  that all that
*  Pull them up by their bootstrap stuff like people love to think that that's how people should be, you know
*  You should just pull yourself up by your bootstraps go out there and fucking make something for yourself
*  That's all true. You definitely should go out there and try to accomplish some goals
*  But there's going to be times in our lives
*  As a community where some shit goes down and it's not anybody's fault, but they need help and that's when we have to
*  evaluate what our taxes go to because if our taxes don't go to
*  some form of
*  excellent very accessible health care and making that more widespread then you're basically saying you don't really care about people's health and
*  Their survival as much as you care about money now if we're going to commit to that kind of a culture after something like this
*  Well, we're insane. We're not learning anything. We should learn something from this what we can learn from this is like we
*  Health-wise
*  We're not prepared whether it's through hospital belts. I'd see use ventilators
*  Social distancing protocols, whatever the fuck it was. We weren't prepared for something like this
*  But now that we are we should all go hey, yeah, you know what man?
*  No one should not have the money to pay for treatment for this. So what do we do? What do we do?
*  Joe, what do we do? What do we change the way we look at our services? It sounds like you said we've got to
*  Change thinking period change thinking but also change what what our money should go to
*  Our money's got to go to that
*  It's got to go to that like that's very important for everybody when people get sick it spreads to all of us now
*  We also we don't want ever to know anyone that you love that's going to die because they can't get health care
*  That's available for people that have money that we got to stop that just like we stop with fire department a fire department
*  Fire department goes to a house when it's on fire because not just that house
*  They don't want to spread through the whole city they go. Well, that's the same thing with health care
*  If someone's really sick if they don't help you and you got coronavirus you spread it to everybody else, right?
*  You don't get the health care. So and you you're contagious. It's almost like a fire in a lot of ways like a viral fire
*  But aren't we living in a system where everybody is qualified to have health care? We should be we should so what is what is covered?
*  California what the fuck is that all about? I don't know man
*  I don't I mean if you think about how much money gets spent on things, right whether it's computers
*  Whether it's cars whether it's houses whether it's what are the things that people buy
*  How how much of a percentage of that?
*  If you could escalate it just a little bit and all that money goes into just health care
*  Not just taxes where no one's accountable. You don't know where the fuck it's going to go. What if everybody's dollar cost a dollar five?
*  Just an added five cents for most things you buy up to a certain point all that money goes straight to health care
*  Wouldn't you be willing to pay instead of a dollar a dollar five or something if you knew that five cents is going to go
*  Towards health care. That's
*  You know as a business person
*  That five cent may mean a lot to me as a business. You're right. It might that's what i'm saying
*  That's it. That might be for I can't know. I look at know that dollar and dollar and five
*  That's only five cents now if you talk about that being billions and millions
*  Then that's why I said up to a certain point up to a certain amount of money
*  Right, I mean after a while with you. Yeah, it seems like it would be better for everybody
*  And it would be better for us to not
*  Worry about what happens if you get sick because you don't know if you're going to be able to pay for it
*  Sometimes people get hit with crazy medical bills after you know an unexpected injury or unexpected disease time in the hospital
*  They got a huge bill that they can't fucking pay. It's real common that I don't know go bankrupt because of that kind of shit
*  And if you're entitled to you got to go get it
*  I don't know just
*  man, this whole kovis shit is so
*  just
*  Uh, I don't even know that's a word. It's just yeah
*  You know you go back and forth with it, but I think that if if anything we can do
*  is like we
*  Must agree. There's no new there's no going back to normal
*  Well, not until they come up with the vaccine and then even normal then it's going to be normal that we realize that this happened
*  And when I say vaccine, I'm not a pro. It's not that i'm saying we gotta take the first vaccine that comes down
*  Don't worry about the microchip. No, let's not get crazy. I'm saying the treatment medicine something that cures
*  This fucking disease just like they've cured every other disease
*  They just like just like they've come up with treatments for polio or smallpox or all the other fucking disease
*  Leave it to the medical scientists leave it to these people that study this shit
*  They're gonna try to figure something out once they do whatever it is if they can and once they do
*  Then I hope we ease back into
*  What would it what life used to be like but with an added knowing until then this shit can go down, right?
*  But until then until then the mask
*  Not today rona
*  Are you nervous? Are you nervous about the future? Uh-uh good beautiful. The only thing I can do is be the best of me
*  You're definitely not the best you with the mask on so take that off. I know
*  I gotta get ready for dinner, too, man
*  Um 20 minutes 20 minutes you're gonna get tested. All right
*  excited
*  i'm super excited i'm telling you just like this when you think about it's like
*  You don't even know a motherfucker didn't know a motherfucker they gotta test yeah, you know what i'm saying? It's like
*  And I know that that's that's definitely the direction we're going in because on the news i've been saying i'm like
*  testing stations testing stations, but I don't know if
*  Everybody knows what's the system and then for what I hear on the news, whatever don't go to the hospital
*  Don't go but I guess going to hospital testing is different. Don't do this
*  unless you
*  Feeling symptoms of feeling bad, you know what i'm saying? Yeah, I read this one article everybody freaking out
*  This doctor was telling people there's so many people that come that don't have it
*  But then they go to the hospital in the waiting room and then they get it in there
*  It's like if you you know, there's people that have the flu and they they don't have coronavirus
*  But then they go and then they get the coronavirus at the hospital while they're waiting around to find out if they got coronavirus
*  Which is like they have a broken leg. They ain't trying to go to the hospital right now
*  I know it's my friend said it he goes i'm not going to hospital for a year. I was like really
*  I took this dude the other day this dude one of my friends is in the hospital
*  And somebody said I told him he's a hospital. It's like man. Fuck that
*  My leg would be broke. Fuck that
*  Yep, god damn it. We're gonna get there joe. I think we're gonna get there
*  I think I think we're gonna figure this out. You know, it's gonna be a tragedy for a lot of us. It's gonna be um
*  Bad for business. It's gonna be bad for restaurants and comedy clubs and everything else
*  But at the end, I think we're gonna emerge with a better understanding of the temporary nature of life of of of our society
*  And hopefully we'll be just cool to each other
*  That's that's what i'm hoping like when when I said I was into bernie sanders
*  What i'm into is someone that wants to look out for people that aren't doing as well
*  And that that this is something that we should all think of but you don't fuck with biden though though. You don't fuck with biden
*  That's what discreet said. They said you don't fuck with biden. It's only somebody said ask him about biden
*  I didn't know if he was fucking with biden or not. I think he's in a
*  Some sort of a state of cognitive decline and it's not my opinion. It's a very common opinion
*  It's not just my opinion. It's uh, you see watch videos of him. He's stammering
*  He doesn't know what he's talking about and they're trying to ignore it and they they would never ignore it
*  If it was uh anybody else that they didn't agree with or they didn't enjoy and you watch the
*  The fact that they're not concerned that these people that are on these left-wing
*  Media shows aren't talking about this and about how important this is and the only people that are talking about it are people
*  That are on these internet, uh
*  Politics shows. Yeah, but they're talking about and bringing it up because they're not holding motherfuckers. Just want to win
*  They just want to win. They don't get worried about some important things. They're worried about the supreme court. They're worried about environmental laws
*  You know, he's laxed a lot of environmental laws that they feel they should never be relaxed and then going into the second term
*  Is he going to do even more crazy shit?
*  You know, there was something that just came out today. Jamie see if you can find that it was uh lowering
*  um
*  the
*  It was for certain toxins that get released into the environment and mercury lowering the standards
*  So it was a some huge
*  issue with um
*  See if you could find it. It was something it was something about uh,
*  Lowering the standards for mercury and other toxins that get released I think from factories
*  Which is like, whoa, what are we? You know, if that's what we're doing. Are we really gonna separate separate that was biden's platform
*  Who's this is trump? This is trump. This is the trump administration. The current administration did this
*  And what does it say? It's behind the washington post paywall, but it says the ep is going to change your rule for
*  Rule-cutting mercury pollution. This is february 17th. It wasn't like oh, no
*  This is a a new article that was out just yesterday that I was reading that was talking about lowering the standards
*  It was talking about in the middle of this coronavirus lockdown. They're lowering the standards for mercury and some other toxins
*  That's I didn't know no standards up. I didn't know three
*  Three hours ago epa gutting rule credited with coal plant toxic air cleanup. Yeah, see fuck that
*  What did that black dude do man?
*  Catfished a female on snapchat to meet and rob victims. What's going to get him robbed live?
*  Look at this epa shit. Go back to that. Hold on
*  Okay, sorry epa. No, no, no, just let me read the the title. They gutted the rule credited with coal plant toxic air cleaner
*  Cleanup, how the fuck do they ever sell that to anybody? Hey, I got an idea
*  You know that shit that we did that would cause the earth to be healthier. Yeah, fuck that right?
*  Let's go back. Let's go back to burning mercury
*  Okay, uh obama era rule the trump administration is gutting an obama era rule that
*  Compelled coal plants to cut back emissions of mercury and other human health hazards limiting future regulation of air pollutants by
*  petroleum and coal plants
*  That's just crazy
*  Yeah
*  That anybody would say yes to that anybody would say that's one thing that we get to see
*  Is our impact on the environment right now because if you look around at the the pictures of los angeles
*  From just two months ago versus now in terms of how much smog is there?
*  That's a wake-up call. I want to know what the black guy did man
*  He catfished someone and robbed them. That's what I mean. How did he get away with it joe? He didn't that's why his pictures in the newspaper
*  All right. I didn't mean I didn't mean to interrupt but I was just I kept saying the black dude
*  I knew you were doing epa. I was like, what the fuck did he do stupid florida?
*  He did it in florida god damn florida
*  Done out. Um, so it looks like we're supposed to do those dates in september now. Really? Yeah, supposedly
*  Yeah, it's supposed to be september 4th and 5th. I saw that but you know what right now this hasn't hit hit
*  because
*  The dates that I had in my book. I'm just right now
*  I've been lucky enough right now to keep them on my calendar and just move them move them
*  Yeah, so it looks like we're hoping we move them, right? Yeah
*  We don't remove them. But the next time you really feel comfortable thinking it's okay. It's probably like fall, right?
*  Hey was that thing that I said about um
*  Um the spanish flu, is that true? Because we couldn't find the meme. It wasn't on charlomene's page. It was on someone else's
*  Yeah, that all the other shit was on charlomene page
*  The one about the spen- yeah, I just wanted to know if that was true
*  So the idea was that they were they they were tired they were celebrating the war
*  and they were they broke the
*  Public distancing
*  Who did?
*  This is in 1918 and then it start the second phase and what what the meme that I read said that it killed
*  The second phase of the flu killed more people than the war did
*  worldwide
*  I'm flu storied out man. I'm too, you know, once we go back. Oh my god
*  It's gonna be it's gonna be it's gonna be nothing but corona jokes corona jokes are gonna quarantine
*  They just got to do a flip. You gotta do something different
*  This it's gonna be so hard if you go on stage after three dudes
*  They're all gonna talk about the coronavirus. They don't talk about the corona virus. Yeah, but then how can you not talk about the corona virus?
*  I've I've
*  I don't it ain't the way I want to fight but you know i'm saying like
*  Michael yo gets first crack because he almost died. Yeah, we should probably have a moratorium
*  And I got the next crack because we don't know
*  I got the next crack. You're gonna know we're gonna find out in 12 minutes. I gotta go to the bathroom, bro
*  Go ahead. Go ahead. Let's wrap it up. Let's wrap it up. Do we what do you client?
*  It's I don't know if it was exactly the way it was explaining the meme. I'll just leave it at that
*  Okay close enough and drink four bottles of water this bitch. I understand bladders. Uh, donnell. Thank you, sir. Always a pleasure my friend man
*  What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do? I love you, man. I love you too, brother. I love you. Thank you
