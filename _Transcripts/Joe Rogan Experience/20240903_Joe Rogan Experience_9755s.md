# JRE MMA Show #162 with Belal Muhammad
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [September 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9MTmo-SLZI)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day!
*  Alright, what's up? Good to see you man, congratulations.
*  Good to see you brother, appreciate you man.
*  The champ is here! Everybody has to shut the fuck up now.
*  That's the best part right now, is now I can just talk as much as possible and they can't say nothing.
*  They can't say nothing. There's so many doubters, so many naysayers, so many people did want you to get that title shot.
*  It was so unfair dude, it was really wild. It was wild to see. It really was. It really was.
*  Because I'm like, are you guys not watching his fights? Like what the fuck are you guys seeing?
*  I do not understand when people don't appreciate excellence. I really don't get it.
*  Like the Sean Brady fight, you see that fight, you don't think this dude is a fucking problem for everybody?
*  You see the Wonder Boy fight, see all your fights.
*  And all of them, they've been different right? Like with the Sean Brady, all I did was stand up.
*  I didn't shoot one takedown on him. Gilbert Burns, I didn't shoot one takedown.
*  Wonder Boy, I took him down. Obviously I'm not going to strike with a kickboxer.
*  So I've showed you guys all forms of martial arts. And people still hated. They're still hating.
*  So crazy.
*  Even with the Leon fight, so even for this fight, I was like bro.
*  The Leon fight, I think they have to shut the fuck up. I think everybody has to shut the fuck up and just recognize what you did.
*  Because you put so much pressure on him standing up. You were in his face from the very first second of the very first round.
*  You just advanced. And you could tell he wanted that space.
*  And you could tell it was a different experience than what he thought he was going to get from you.
*  Yeah, I mean when we saw him against Colby and him against Usmanda, the third fight, we saw that he's an expert at distance.
*  He manages the distance. He puts it at his own pace. So we were like, bro, we got to make this the dirtiest fight, the hardest fight for him.
*  So we got to step right away. So even when the ref was looking to me, telling me to back up, when he looked at Leon and said, you ready, you ready?
*  I'm walking forward right away. So I'm right in his face before he even looks up.
*  So I was like, I got to get him on his back foot right away, make him uncomfortable. And I knew he's not good uncomfortable.
*  No striker is really good moving backwards. But I knew Leon specifically, I don't want to be in his kick range.
*  I don't want him at his slow pace like he did against Colby and these guys where kicks, moves, kicks, moves.
*  I'm like, I'm going to be in his face nonstop, punching him in his mouth and taking him down whenever I see an opening.
*  The Colby fight I thought was going to be different. I think Colby broke his foot real early in that fight.
*  I mean, I think Colby sucks. But for me, I think that Colby wasn't he's just not a good striker.
*  Even with the fights that we see that he was really good at, it was just because he put a good pace on all these guys.
*  And he dictated the pace with RDA and Robbie Lawler, all these guys. But none of those guys really had that type of cardio.
*  When we saw him against Usman, Usman showed you he could keep up that pace with Colby and then Colby can't take him down.
*  So it ended up being like a kickboxing match. For Leon, he knew if he dictated the pace with Colby, Colby wasn't going to be able to do anything to him.
*  And I don't think the time off I think hurt Colby's distance management because his shot takedowns were terrible in that fight.
*  He didn't. He wasn't managing it. He was just shooting at it.
*  To be honest though, I think the foot had a big factor because I think he broke his foot.
*  I think Leon checked the kick real early on or he kicked low and hit the shin and broke his foot, hit the knee something.
*  I don't remember exactly what happened, but apparently in the first round he broke his foot.
*  If you can't move against Leon, you're in real trouble.
*  Yeah, I mean especially because Leon's so good at his lateral movement and his kicks hurt so hard.
*  So for me I was like, I can't be in kicking range at all.
*  I think I felt like one body kick early and I was like, all right, let me step forward on it.
*  So even with my mindset the whole camp, I probably took two to three thousand body kicks and then moved forward on each of them.
*  And if I backed up at all, my coaches yelling at me, look what you did here. You did this wrong. Move forward, move forward.
*  We can't take one step back. So I was like, I was writing it down. I was putting it in my head.
*  Do not take a step back. Do not take a step back. And then it just came out in the fight.
*  It came out perfect. It was a master plan. It really was. Watching you execute it, I was just so shocked.
*  First of all, his inability to deal with you on the feet.
*  Because even if it was just a kickboxing match, there was so much pressure and so much volume of strikes.
*  You were constantly on him. Your boxing was so on point, man. It would look better than it's ever looked.
*  I think people just underestimate me when they look at me because they say, oh, he doesn't have a bunch of knockouts.
*  But when you look at my fights and you see the way I pieced up a lot of these big names like Gilbert and Sean Brady, I beat them both on the feet.
*  And for the Leon fight, my gym is small, but we have I work with I think who's the best striker in the UFC right now.
*  He's a 55, Ignacio Balmendes. This kid is a monster. He probably has like, you saw his spinning heel kick knockout.
*  I'm sparring with this dude every single day. So I'm like, nothing that Leon was going to throw at me was going to surprise me.
*  Nothing was going to make me uncomfortable. And for me, if you're beating me up, I want to keep going to you.
*  So for Nacho, I'm like, bro, throw the kitchen sink at me. I want you to throw everything you have in your tool bag at me.
*  So whatever Leon throws, I'm just going to be comfortable in that fire.
*  So for me, it was just nonstop, nonstop sparring, sparring, sparring, even if it's not hard sparring, light sparring, just enough to see everything and have my reaction time.
*  And I think that helps a lot with the way I've been fighting lately.
*  How much time did you have to prepare for Leon? I had about eight weeks.
*  Did they did you kind of have an inkling that it was going to happen before that? Like, had you been preparing mentally before that?
*  That was the hardest part, right? The lead up because it was after beating Gilbert, they're like, you're guaranteed next.
*  And then you're like, when is it happening? They're like, well, Kobe has to fight first.
*  So then I'm sitting there in the playing the waiting game and then they offered me Usman.
*  They're like, well, you know, if you don't want to wait, we can give you Usman.
*  So we were at talks with Usman and then Usman ended up fighting Hamza on short notice.
*  So then I was like, all right, well, there's nothing else they can put in front of me.
*  It's going to be me against the winner of Kobe and Leon.
*  And then that fight happens. And then Leon's trying to brush it off like, no, there's still other guys I could look at and see who's next.
*  And he even brought up Gilbert Burns. And I'm like, bro, I just beat Gilbert Burns.
*  So I'm sitting there, you know, in limbo, like what's happening? I'm calling my manager every day and Ali's my manager.
*  And he's like, but trust me, Dana's not going to go against his word. He's going to give you the shot.
*  He's going to give you the shot. And then all of a sudden, 300 comes up and I'm like, oh, so we're probably going to be 300.
*  And then they say, oh, they offered to fight to three other guys. And I was one of those guys.
*  So then like I'm sitting there like, bro, wait, no way. Am I about to get screwed right now? Are they going to give it to somebody else?
*  Did you ask it like, why didn't I get the fight at 300? If they were trying to get Leon to fight at 300, why didn't you get that title shot?
*  For me, it was just like I put it out there. I said if they really wanted Leon to fight there, they would have put me on there.
*  I said, yes. You know, they asked. They said they asked Islam. They said they asked Shafka.
*  They said they asked Hamza and they all said no, because Ramadan.
*  But I fought multiple times during Ramadan. So for me, I'm like, if they really wanted Leon, they could have had him with me.
*  But I think they just wanted to have that shock factor with 300.
*  Where it's like, oh, double champ status for Islam or Hamza, obviously a huge star. He comes back down.
*  So I think they just wanted that. And Leon is not a promoter. He doesn't really promote his fights in general.
*  Obviously, he's a great fighter. But for 300, I think they want somebody that's going to try to push the event.
*  Yeah, but still, the rules are the rules. You know, a guy makes it to the top of the heap. He's supposed to be next in line for a title shot.
*  Yeah. I mean, for me, I'm like, what else do I got to do?
*  All the purists felt that way. I didn't see anybody who's like a real solid MMA fan who felt that was a lot of the casuals, a lot of the casuals jumping in with their goofy opinions on things.
*  But that's the age we live in, right? The troll age. Nobody has a profile picture.
*  I'm just saying the dumbest stuff.
*  Well, not only that, you have a disparate look. The reality of the numbers is I had a joke in my act that 90% of all Twitter is done by 10% of the people.
*  And those people are 100% retarded. It really almost is that. That's a joke, but it's kind of almost true because are you commenting on shit all the time?
*  Do you go to someone's YouTube videos and talk? You're busy. You're busy being the fucking welterweight champion in the world. You got a time for that.
*  So the people that have time to be doing that all the time are unfortunately generally not doing that good. They're not.
*  Michael Jordan's not leaving YouTube comments. You know what I'm saying?
*  It's like the people that are engaged in these attacks on specific fighters in particular, they're usually just dorks.
*  And I get it that these dorks buy pay-per-view and I get it these dorks. But they're not most people.
*  Most people want to see the best people fight the best people. And would it be exciting to see Islam go up and try to win at 170?
*  Fuck yeah, it would be. I'd be all in for that fight, unfortunately for you. I mean, it sounds great.
*  But if I was running things, I'd be like the fights are going to be fucking great anyway. It's UFC 300.
*  Everyone's going to be super hyped up. There's so much on the line. It's a crazy fucking card. That's a great fight. It's a great fight.
*  Yeah, and it's two guys that are on 10 fight winning streaks.
*  But how weird was it to have to do the fight at like five in the morning?
*  Oh my God.
*  So let's explain that to people who don't know. The UFC that was done in England was done on American pay-per-view time.
*  So the card had to start. What did it start, like 1 a.m.?
*  Yeah, it started. Yeah, the first fight was 1 a.m.
*  Fight of the night, 1 a.m., undercard, UFC fight pass, first fight of the night. That's crazy. That's so crazy.
*  As if we can't watch it earlier in the day. As if UFC fans on a fucking Saturday are going to say, oh, the pay-per-view starts at noon.
*  Okay, we watch football games at noon. We watch world title fights at noon. Making you guys fight at five in the morning to me was bananas.
*  I was like, that is so contrary to anything you would want from optimum physical performance.
*  Yeah, it was wild. Like we got down there the week before on Saturday and we found a gym.
*  So we were like, let's start trying to work out at 4 a.m.
*  Because being the main event, they said it would probably be on around like 5, 5.30.
*  So the hardest part was just trying to stay up from midnight to 4 a.m. to go drive to this gym.
*  We had a big house so we had a bunch of people with us. But one person yawns and it's like addictive.
*  And it's like, bro, it's midnight. We're all just like watching Netflix.
*  We didn't have no games or anything. So we're just like trying to watch movies.
*  And then one guy yawns and you're like, I'm going to go upstairs by myself for a second.
*  And then just like, the PI is really good because they gave us like some jet lag like glasses that shine light in your eyes that you're supposed to turn on right when the sun sets.
*  Because when the sun sets, you start getting melatonin in your body and makes you want to go to sleep.
*  So they like put this on when the sun sets. So it like shocks your body, make you think it's about to be sunlight.
*  Really? Yeah. Oh, wow.
*  So I'm walking around the house with like these glasses that are like shining light in my eyes and it still was hard.
*  We were like, fuck you bitches. Three in the morning.
*  We went to go work out. So I'm trying to get everybody to work out with me.
*  We had maybe five or six guys with us and then the gym was at 30 minutes away.
*  So by the time we finished working out at night, it was starting.
*  The sun was rising because it was like 7 a.m. And I'm like, how am I about to fall asleep right now?
*  So I would like take melatonin fight week and then it would make wake me up at like 2 p.m.
*  And I would still be a groggy the rest of the day. And then you have to do like interviews and stuff like that.
*  It was it was hard. So did you try to stay on Chicago time the whole the whole thing?
*  I tried, but it was it was still hard just because, like I said, that that time in between where that board time, right?
*  Where we're like, all right, we got to work out at 4 a.m.
*  And then, you know, during the day we had interviews and stuff starting at 3 p.m.
*  They adjusted those times. So then we would finish everything. It would be like 7 p.m.
*  How have they done London cards in the past? Did they do that in the past?
*  They've done it once with I think it was busy against Hendo twice.
*  Hendo 2. The second one? Yeah, the second one.
*  But other than that, they would just do it. And American time zone would be like daytime here.
*  That's so crazy. But I think pay per view wise, they expect more people to buy pay per views in prime time like night 9 p.m.
*  Probably. Yeah. Yeah, I guess.
*  But when they go to Abu Dhabi, we still fight Abu Dhabi time nighttime. Yeah. And then over here, it's daytime. Yeah.
*  But I wonder if they see like a change in numbers with that and that made them adjust.
*  They probably do. But whatever. Yeah. That's my feelings. Whatever.
*  Like we can't have people fight five in the morning. That's nonsense.
*  You can't have an audience there at five in the morning. Fucking exhausted for a world title fight. Exhausted.
*  Can't believe you're still awake. For me, I was like, I hope they are exhausted.
*  I'm like, they're probably going to be booing me anyway. So I'm like, let's let them get drunk starting at midnight.
*  Let them be dead tired once it gets to that level.
*  How many people were asleep in the audience? People started leaving early.
*  It was like the fourth round. And I think I got the last eight down and I was like finishing on top of them.
*  They said people were leaving. Wow. And I was like, that's a good sign.
*  That just tells me that they know that there's nothing else he could really do.
*  He had one big moment in the last round. Yeah, I still got it right here.
*  And it's just like I just keep shaking my head every time I think of it.
*  But it just tells me that I still have stuff to fix, still have stuff to work on.
*  And you can never get too comfortable, especially with him.
*  But yeah, my coach is the type that will tell me everything I did wrong after a fight instead of the stuff I did right.
*  So right away, now look at your face. Now look at you.
*  You did that because you took your foot off the gas for one second and something could happen.
*  Who knows if there was a minute left what could have happened or blah, blah, blah.
*  I'm like, I won coach. I'm the real champion. You chill out.
*  But he wants it to be perfect. Yeah.
*  That was it was interesting because it was you could see him using energy management.
*  You could see him trying to figure out when to just defend and when to try to break free and when to plan himself and fire shots and when to just stay on the back foot and keep moving.
*  He tried to hold you off a few times.
*  But I think whatever you're doing for strength and conditioning, your cardio is insane.
*  Because the volume, just the sheer volume and pressure that you were putting on him and the fact that you keep that up solid five rounds.
*  Yeah, that was insane. Yeah.
*  I think every fighter's fear is to get tired in the cage.
*  Every fighter's fear is to be in there and not be able to lift up your arms.
*  You've seen it happen with a lot of guys, big name guys where you'll see them give up a choke and it'd be like he just looked up his neck and maybe he was too tired.
*  No, he just wanted to get out of there.
*  For me, I have no fear and I know that I could go harder than any of these guys.
*  And if I'm tired, I know he's going to be twice as tired.
*  But I think a lot of it, like you said, is just the team I have around me.
*  I do strength and conditioning with my boy, Matt Murphy, but it's not anything outrageous.
*  We're not doing that crazy new stuff that's coming out.
*  We do heavy weights and we do like the big muscles like chest, lower back and squats.
*  But we put all this other stuff around it like the cosmetic stuff too.
*  And we're lifting three days a week.
*  What do you mean by cosmetic stuff?
*  Like say if I go heavy on my squat and then we'll still end up doing like lower back, chest and like dumbbells, chest and everything on that day.
*  But like on a heavy chest day, we're going like legs, lunges, like lesser weight.
*  So we go heavy with like squats, chest and deadlifts one day a week for each of those.
*  And then we still do full body stuff that same day, but just like lower the weights and higher reps.
*  So you're essentially doing almost like you're doing like power lift at work.
*  Yeah. You're doing bench press, like just power generating stuff.
*  Yeah.
*  Are you doing any plyometrics or any of that kind of stuff?
*  I mean, I do a lot of swimming for my cardio wise.
*  And then people make fun of me a lot.
*  Swimming is so hard.
*  Swimming is fucking hard.
*  People don't know how to say it.
*  People when they, when I take them to the pool, like when I take a brand new fighter to the pool and that they never swam before, they get so tired.
*  Yeah.
*  And I tell them, bro, it's a full body workout.
*  It's everything you need, especially for fighting.
*  It's like one of the hardest things you could do, especially if you're like built like you, because you probably sink like a rock.
*  Yeah.
*  It's hard to stay above water.
*  Yeah.
*  Like fat people, they say swimming is not hard.
*  Right.
*  You got a floaty on.
*  You're literally swimming around with a floaty.
*  You could float.
*  Yeah.
*  Dense dudes just go right under.
*  You got to struggle to stay above water.
*  And I don't have like the best technique to doing it.
*  So I still like go there and I'm like, I'm going to go a mile and then I'll go and I'll take a little break.
*  Go take a little break.
*  And like you said, you see like that fat person just going nonstop.
*  Yeah.
*  You're looking at them like, bro, I just want to like slap them.
*  What am I doing wrong?
*  They're cheating.
*  Yeah.
*  They're cheating.
*  They got a human floaty on.
*  But it's a hard.
*  I remember Maury Smith was the first guy that started using swimming for MMA.
*  You know, Maury Smith was training with Frank Shamrock when Frank Shamrock was just a cardio machine.
*  Frank, I think Frank Shamrock was the first guy in the UFC that had like a full, complete arsenal of MMA weapons.
*  He could stand.
*  He could take eyes down.
*  He could strangle you.
*  He could arm bar you.
*  He could do everything.
*  He could submit you off his back.
*  And Frank was just a cardio machine.
*  And when Maurice went from kickboxing and got into MMA, he was doing a lot of training with Frank.
*  And they were real.
*  Maurice was super cardio focused.
*  Yeah.
*  So that's like when he beat Mark Coleman.
*  He beat Mark Coleman because Mark Coleman got tired.
*  Yeah.
*  And then Maurice defended off of his.
*  And that's the old days, bro, when they had headbutt.
*  That was the headbutt days.
*  You know, that's crazy.
*  And Maurice started tuning them up on the feet.
*  Once Maurice got up to his feet, he was just leg kicking the shit out of them.
*  And he was talking to them saying, come on, Mark, ground me and pound me.
*  I thought you were going to ground me and pound me.
*  Whack.
*  Whack.
*  He didn't take any crazy chances.
*  And, you know, so he didn't get taken down at the end.
*  But he won the heavyweight title.
*  It's funny how you say that.
*  The headbutt days.
*  I was I did an interview yesterday with the Chicago News.
*  And then the lady's like she had no idea who I was.
*  I'm like, you didn't do no research because she's like, you're the champion of street fighting, right?
*  Oh, boy.
*  I'm like, imagine that you're literally the world champion.
*  And this person hasn't even done five minutes of research into sport.
*  You do.
*  I was I was wild.
*  And I was like, people still think that.
*  You should just start making shit up.
*  Yeah, we made it in alleyways, you know, sunny vids.
*  You got to get it on the dark web.
*  I had my roll of nickels in my hand.
*  I don't give a fuck.
*  I didn't realize there's still people out here that have that mindset like.
*  Well, there's people in the news that aren't even humans.
*  They're just robots.
*  They're like media robots.
*  All they want to do is be on TV.
*  They have no opinions, no personality.
*  I hear you're the champion of street fighting.
*  I'm looking at the teleprompter.
*  I'm like, I feel like that's all they do is read the teleprompter.
*  That's such that's so disrespectful to someone who has risen to the top of the greatest organization ever for combat sports.
*  We all know that.
*  Look, I'm a huge boxing fan.
*  Boxing is amazing.
*  I love boxing.
*  But we all know if Francis Ngannou and Tyson Fury had a fight fight, that shit would not last one round.
*  There's not a chance in hell.
*  They had a fight fight, a real fight like an MMA fight.
*  Boxing is a sport.
*  MMA is the sport of fighting.
*  It's the hardest fucking thing to do for an athlete.
*  The hardest thing to do is what you did.
*  Become the champion of the world in a tank filled with sharks.
*  It's not saying that it's not if you were 170 pound boxer, it'd be just as difficult.
*  I'm not saying boxing is not hard to do.
*  I'm not saying it's hard as fuck to be a Ryan Garcia, hard as fuck to be a Gervonta Davis.
*  Just the same mentality they have, they would have been world champions in MMA.
*  But MMA is harder.
*  It's harder.
*  And it's more effective.
*  It's the real sport of fighting.
*  So for you to reach the pinnacle in the greatest combat sport ever, and this lady to go,
*  you're the champion of street fighting, and you're on fucking TV.
*  That's so great.
*  Why can't they bring in an expert?
*  There's so many people who could have interviewed you.
*  I was like, yeah, don't you guys have a sportscaster or somebody that's going to interview me?
*  Call in Ariel Helwani.
*  Call in somebody.
*  There's somebody out there that can do this.
*  This is crazy.
*  Or do one little second of research.
*  Oh, the UFC.
*  Yeah, but even then, they're going to be asking you stupid ass questions.
*  You should have someone who knows what the fuck they're talking about.
*  They have to have a sports guy.
*  Don't they have a sports guy?
*  The sports guy's got to know.
*  They did.
*  And that's what I was like, why am I getting with these two?
*  And she was like, so you do boxing then too?
*  And I'm like, well, boxing is a part of it.
*  It's mixed martial arts.
*  A lot of thumb wrestling.
*  That's a real important part of my game.
*  We do power slap.
*  I'm the champion of that.
*  I have the most powder on my hand when I slap.
*  It's just disrespectful.
*  It's just a bummer that people don't get it yet.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like so many people, way more people get it now than never got it before.
*  When I first started doing commentary for the UFC was in 97.
*  When I first started doing backstage interviews, and people were acting like I was doing porn.
*  They were like, what are you doing?
*  Like, why are you doing that?
*  Are you crazy?
*  I go, I love it.
*  It's great.
*  What the fuck are you talking about?
*  Yeah.
*  It was like being involved in that was bad for your career.
*  That's wild.
*  Yeah.
*  Dana and I have talked about it so many times.
*  Like people would tell people that he bought the UFC and they'd be like, what the fuck are you doing?
*  Like, God, that's terrible.
*  Meanwhile, everybody watches it now.
*  Yeah.
*  It's going to be up there bigger than I think all the other sports.
*  It'll be bigger than everything but football in America.
*  You're never going to beat football.
*  You can't beat football.
*  You're seeing this next younger generation.
*  It's just wild how they're coming up.
*  Like kids are starting.
*  My boy, Ignacio, his brother's 15 years old and he's already five and old pro.
*  Crazy.
*  I'm like, bro, you're starting this young?
*  15.
*  Yeah, and you're a pro?
*  Crazy.
*  I'm like, that's wild.
*  Fighting pro at 15 is nuts.
*  That's nuts.
*  You're fighting pro men at 15.
*  Yeah, his next fight is for the title.
*  He's like a 30 year old and I'm just like, bro.
*  Oh my God, that's so crazy.
*  Where's this happening?
*  It's in Columbia.
*  Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.
*  Yeah.
*  You go wild down there, boy.
*  They don't have any fucking rules.
*  That's wild.
*  You can fight at 15.
*  But imagine when he gets to his 20s, the experience he's going to have.
*  Oh yeah.
*  And then if one of these younger guys now that only fought locally in Chicago or something, they see him.
*  He's going to look at them like, okay, let me show you what I do.
*  Do you think there's something to be said for not jumping in too quick?
*  Because I feel like there's some fighters that they just got rushed and they weren't really prepared for an elite fighter and they got tuned up and they were kind of never the same again.
*  I think there's been a few guys like that that I think had real potential, but someone rushed them into a top 10 situation way too quick.
*  Yeah, 100%.
*  I think Darren Till is probably like the biggest one I think of when I think of that, when he rushed him to the title fight.
*  It's hard to say though, because Darren Till, when he knocked out Cowboy, see, people have two Darren Tills in their head.
*  They have Darren Till with knee injuries, older, later in his career, and you have Darren Till when he was 170.
*  Yeah.
*  Darren Till, when he could make 170, and dude, he was dangerous.
*  When he fucked up Cowboy, I was like, Jesus Christ, this guy's fucking terrifying.
*  He was ferocious, but he didn't keep that for whatever reason.
*  He didn't keep that level of success.
*  He had mad potential.
*  So I'm not sure if he got rushed or if he just got injured or if it was just a grappling game.
*  He was too late taking in the grappling game.
*  I think there's just a lot of guys that don't know how to take a loss.
*  I think that once they, you know, he was undefeated, then you get your first loss.
*  And then you go back to the gym, your confidence deflated.
*  You look at people, look at you differently.
*  Like you don't have that same, you know, mentality.
*  I'm the biggest one in the room.
*  Well, Tyron Woodley, he fought Tyron when Tyron is in his prime.
*  That was prime time, Tyron Woodley, and Tyron Woodley fucked him up.
*  But Tyron Woodley in his prime fucked everybody up.
*  Everybody just thinks about that Jake Paul fight.
*  Get that out of your head.
*  That's an older athlete at the end of his run doing something only really mostly for money.
*  Bruce Ma said it yesterday.
*  He said like people are so quick to forget, right?
*  Of the stuff you did when you were great and when you're at the top.
*  And especially guys like Woodley where he was one of the best to ever do it.
*  One of the best.
*  Then later you start losing a couple.
*  Exactly.
*  And then it just tarnishes everything.
*  I'm like, bro, go back to the knockout of Robbie Allard.
*  That was crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  Like the way he did it.
*  And Robbie was the man at that time.
*  I think one of his most impressive performances, two of his most impressive performances,
*  are performances that weren't even that exciting.
*  And that's the Wonder Boy fight.
*  Because he fought the perfect fight with Wonder Boy.
*  He never led.
*  Never led.
*  He's like, let's make it boring.
*  I don't give a fuck.
*  But then when they had exchanges, Tyron hurt Wonder Boy.
*  Wonder Boy never hurt Tyron.
*  Wonder Boy is a 57 and 0 kickboxer.
*  One of the greatest strikers the UFC has ever seen.
*  But he was so worried about those takedowns that he didn't really commit either.
*  And then when, and he was always worried about the takedown, which of course you know opens up punches.
*  And Tyron could fucking crack.
*  Tyron could crack back then.
*  When he knocked out Lawler with one punch, like, holy shit.
*  Tyron could crack.
*  People forget.
*  Yeah.
*  When I fought Wonder Boy, that was like one of the fights I watched.
*  And then that was one of the fights I was most afraid of.
*  Because you're looking at him against Woodley, him against Johnny Hendrix.
*  And none of these guys could take him down.
*  And then Anthony Pettis told me like, bro, I was like, should I bring in somebody for him?
*  And he's like, nah, because nobody ever, nobody moves like him.
*  And his kicks hurt harder than anybody else I brought in.
*  Because he brought in like Sage Northcutt and those guys to be like him.
*  And Mike Biggie-Roads.
*  And he's like, bro, Wonder Boy is just different.
*  So he said, I would just try to wrestle.
*  And I was like, all right, let's go.
*  And then I was like, let me just get ahead of him right away and grab ahold of him and not pull back at all.
*  So the problem with Wonder Boy is he can do some shit that other people can't do.
*  And one of them is that lead leg.
*  That lead leg is a real problem because he's got the best front leg side kick in the business.
*  And he also throws that round kick off the front leg over your shoulder.
*  And you don't see his first knockout in the UFC.
*  He throws that shit over the shoulder.
*  You don't see it until it's up there.
*  And you're like, oh, shit, it's too late.
*  Yeah.
*  And he disguises his stuff so beautifully.
*  But he disguises it with his personality because before the fight he's like, hey, what's up, bro?
*  How you doing?
*  And then I'm like, bro, I know you're going to try to kill me tomorrow, man.
*  But he's genuinely sweet.
*  He's not putting it like some guys will do that just to try to throw you off.
*  But that literally is Wonder Boy.
*  He's a sweetheart of a guy.
*  The nicest.
*  Happens to be a killer.
*  Yeah.
*  You know?
*  And I feel like Wonder Boy, man, he's one of those guys.
*  He, I feel like if he had gotten into MMA earlier and really learned grappling earlier with that kickbox,
*  like maybe if he hadn't had 50 kickboxing fights but only had like, he was an elite at 20 fights in, I'm sure, 30 fights in.
*  Yeah.
*  And really gotten into MMA when he was a younger man.
*  Because the thing about fight, like he's 40 now or 41.
*  Yeah.
*  The thing about fighting is if you're not cheating and you're getting into your 40s, like there's no way.
*  There's no way you're the same guy you were when you were 25.
*  It's not possible.
*  Yeah.
*  So if you don't have the same body to work with, it doesn't matter how good the mind is.
*  It doesn't matter how good.
*  We've all seen it from the great champs.
*  They just hung around too long and the body just doesn't perform anymore.
*  And they know what to do, but the body can't do it.
*  Yeah.
*  And everything just slows down.
*  Your reflexes.
*  Even your mindset, right?
*  Because you don't want to, it's the hardest thing to train for.
*  You have to fight every day in the practice room to train for a fight.
*  So these guys who've been doing it for so long, you're burnt out.
*  So it's like you get to your 40s and you got a family and stuff.
*  You're like, do I want to train two to three times a day?
*  Do I want to go to the gym right now and wrestle?
*  Yeah.
*  Like I think that's one of the keys that my coach is very good at.
*  He like tells all of his guys like, we're wrestling three times a week.
*  If you're not at wrestling practice, then you're not going to be at sparring practice.
*  Because a lot of our guys are really great strikers.
*  Nacho's been striking with him since he was 16 years old.
*  He tells him like, I don't care if you hate this right now, you don't know how to wrestle.
*  You're going to lose.
*  You could be the best striker in the world, but all the champions know how to wrestle.
*  That's a solid coach right there because every guy needs to learn that.
*  Because there's so many dudes who don't want to roll because they don't want to get tapped out,
*  but they're elite kickboxers.
*  There was a bunch of those guys in the early days of the UFC just didn't quite pick that part up
*  and never excelled.
*  Yeah, I see that a lot with guys.
*  Like I said, they don't want to get beat up.
*  They go to practice and they don't want to get in.
*  That's when the ego comes in, right?
*  I'm a UFC fighter.
*  I shouldn't be losing to Joe Schmoe at a Jiu Jitsu class.
*  So there's like avoid those guys.
*  Well, yeah, I don't think Wonderboy ever avoided anybody like that.
*  I just think he was late to the game, you know, and he was training a lot with Weidman,
*  who's an awesome wrestler.
*  But like he got his first loss in the UFC, I think was Mike Brown.
*  Yeah, and Mike Brown just mauled him, just mauled him.
*  That was Mike Brown in his prime, who was a scary motherfucker.
*  The dude played no games.
*  He played no games.
*  Mike Brown was trying to kill you.
*  I would wish that I would never get that call to like, hey, do you want to fight Mike Brown?
*  And I was like, man, I was like, bro, no, my brother's like, call him out.
*  And I'm like, bro, I'm not going to call Matt Brown.
*  My brother's always the type to be like, you could be anybody.
*  And I was like, nah, I'll call him.
*  If they call me for Matt Brown, I'll do it, but I'm not going to call him out, though.
*  You don't want to get him motivated.
*  Yeah, he's the boogeyman.
*  I feel like there's some dudes that, for whatever reason, with Matt Brown, he died.
*  He had overdosed, and he had a serious drug problem.
*  I think there's guys who see the other side, and they come back, and they just have a different mentality.
*  They almost lost their life to some really stupid shit.
*  And they have a grip on life that's a little bit different, and a drive that's a little different.
*  There's been a few guys that I know that were like real heavy drug addicts,
*  and got off the drugs and just became performance freaks, just endurance freaks, just animals.
*  And so disciplined. You're like, wow, how is it that this guy used to be a drug addict, a junkie?
*  And now this guy's weighing his food and drinking electrolyte-filled water and fucking showing up before anybody,
*  and putting in those rounds on the air dye machine after practice.
*  It's like, god damn.
*  I lived with Jared Gordon for three years together. He's like my best friend.
*  Same situation.
*  He would say, I'm going to go for a jog. I'm like, all right, cool.
*  And he'll be like, come back like three hours later. I'm like, what are you doing?
*  I just ran 20 miles. And I'm just like, you said you're going for a jog. That's not a jog. It's like a marathon.
*  And he would just do that out of nowhere.
*  Like you said, they just had that crazy cardio endurance, and they'll just go nonstop.
*  And I think it's that type of mindset, right? It just gets your mind off all their stuff.
*  They're a little extra spooky.
*  A little extra spooky, those former junkies.
*  I don't know why, man. They're like not playing any fucking games.
*  You know, guys that have almost died, they are not playing any fucking games with you.
*  It's interesting because there's different things that make a great fighter.
*  There's a lot of stuff. There's genetics. There's gifts.
*  Some people just have that touch of death. They just have that one shot KO power.
*  Some guys just are born with crazy.
*  Like Cain Velasquez, they said, just has genetic cardio.
*  They said that motherfucker could take months off the gym, come in and just smother everybody.
*  And nobody could deal with them.
*  They said it was crazy. Like nobody had ever seen anything like it.
*  Like I think Cain for sure was an elite fighter because of his mind, his discipline, his drive, his determination, his skill set.
*  I mean he was, I think in his prime, there's the argument of who's the best heavyweight of all time, and I always throw Cain in there.
*  I think prime time Cain was, he was a tornado.
*  He was a tornado. You couldn't understand how a heavyweight could be throwing so many punches.
*  He never stopped. And he could take you down.
*  And if you took him down, he didn't give a fuck. He'd get right back up.
*  Like with Brock Lesnar, he was a tornado in that cage.
*  And I was able to go down to AKA and get some work in with the guys on there.
*  And Cain was there. Yeah, it was just, I was so intimidated.
*  I was like, oh, this is Cain Velasquez. He's a killer.
*  And he's like the nicest guy in the world.
*  Super nice guy.
*  But seeing how athletic he was, he was like doing cartwheels in the gym and just like seeing how he moves,
*  I'm like, now I could understand why he was such a great heavyweight and such a killer.
*  He was the perfect model heavyweight in his prime.
*  You know, like 240, not too big. So he has insane cardio.
*  You never going to see a guy like Francis that has the kind of cardio that Cain has.
*  I don't think it's possible. I think you'd get a trade with Francis.
*  You get the touch of death. You get that one shot.
*  Everybody's like, oh shit, like the ouster over him fight.
*  Yeah. God damn.
*  Like he had that crazy, crazy power.
*  But I don't think you get that power with that endurance.
*  It doesn't, I've never seen anybody that has that kind of power that also like Connor even.
*  Yeah.
*  Amazing power, but he doesn't have the kind of endurance that some of these guys that have less power do.
*  Yeah. I'm interested to see how Aspinall has passed the first round, right?
*  Because we've seen him. He looks so fast.
*  You're like nobody moves like him. He looks like a younger Cain.
*  Right.
*  But he just keeps knocking these guys out so quick.
*  So I'm like, let me see him pass the first round to see if he has that cardio as well.
*  It's a bit of a problem for him, right?
*  Because he has not been tested in that way.
*  And you know, you're getting up to elite status where you're calling out John Jones.
*  Yeah.
*  Right? That's the boogie man.
*  John Jones is the fucking boogie man.
*  And maybe he hasn't died, but he's probably knocked on the door a couple of times.
*  Like what's going on, death? You in there?
*  You know, John Jones has had some trials and tribulations.
*  But the skill set and the ability to push deep into rounds is nuts.
*  Like John fought, when he fought Gustafson, he had almost no training camp.
*  They said he barely showed up.
*  Like, you know, I talked to Jackson about it.
*  And Greg Jackson was telling me, he didn't even train for that fight.
*  Wow.
*  And then he pulled that fight off in the fourth and fifth rounds.
*  That's when he really turned it up.
*  So you're talking about a guy who hasn't even been training.
*  And then you saw the real John Jones in the second fight.
*  That's motivated John Jones.
*  Who's like, I'm going to show you what the fuck is really up.
*  And then he just beats the shit out of Gustafson in the second fight.
*  And I wonder if it's going to get him to that point.
*  All this talking from Aspinaw, does it get him motivated, right?
*  Or is it going to be a point like, let me be done with Stepe and be done with it.
*  But I don't want to heavyweight motivated John Jones if I'm on the other side.
*  The way he just pulled Gon down so easily and choked him out, I was like, bro.
*  And then Gon looks good in the last two fights.
*  Gon is like one of the most exciting guys on the feet.
*  He's so athletic in that style.
*  He's had a weird front kick, too.
*  You ever notice his front kick? Like a twisting front kick off the front leg?
*  Yeah, a little push kick, yeah.
*  But it's weird because he turns it and snaps it up.
*  So he jabs you with the toes.
*  There's a kick in taekwondo that's kind of a goofy kick.
*  It's called a twisting kick.
*  And you kind of do it to the face.
*  And it's like you swing your leg up and kick like this.
*  It's like this.
*  But that's what he's doing in a sideways stance.
*  He's just doing it to the body.
*  He's got a twisting front kick.
*  Nobody kicks like him.
*  And you heard BamBam with that, right?
*  Bro, he fucked BamBam up.
*  That was like Cyril Gon at his very best.
*  A guy like BamBam who just comes forward and takes a hell of a shot.
*  He's not scared to take one to give one.
*  I mean, Tui Vaso is one of the most exciting guys of all time, right?
*  Yeah, and it's crazy how...
*  But that style with Gon, Gon's this elite striker, incredible lateral movement,
*  counter punching the ability to move out of range and dive right back in real quick.
*  But Aspinall was like...
*  We've only seen him smash.
*  We've only seen...
*  We've never seen him be the nail.
*  No, but I would write...
*  And I thought Pavlovich was going to be the one that was like...
*  It's going to be a banger.
*  And he just puts him to sleep.
*  And he took Pavlovich's fight with a fucked up rib.
*  He couldn't even wrestle.
*  Yeah, short notice too, right?
*  I mean, imagine you going up against Pavlovich.
*  You know the only guys who's ever beat him was Overeem.
*  And Overeem took him down, beat him up on the ground.
*  And you're like, I got to get this guy down.
*  This guy's knocking everybody dead.
*  And he knocks him out standing.
*  He's so fast for a heavyweight.
*  But again, you're saying the right thing.
*  Like what is it like in the fifth round with John Jones?
*  Because if you can't steamroll John Jones and he starts side kicking your fucking kneecaps, you know?
*  There's nobody better with distance than John.
*  The best.
*  Nobody comes close.
*  A lot of that too.
*  I know you've experienced that.
*  Man.
*  Yeah.
*  How many eye surgeries have you had to have?
*  I've had three.
*  Wow.
*  Holy shit.
*  They're literally the hardest thing in the world.
*  The most depressing thing in the world.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't think.
*  Did you have one after the Leon fight or before?
*  I had one after that as well.
*  Wow.
*  Even in my fight in when I fought Lukey after the third round, I went back to my corner.
*  I was like, there's something in my eye.
*  And like I couldn't see out of my eye.
*  And I'm like trying to blink it out.
*  And then the cut man Tate, he's like, bro, ain't nothing wrong with your eye.
*  Stop touching your eye.
*  So then I was like, all right, well, whatever.
*  So I go back in there to fourth and fifth round.
*  And I just can't manage this.
*  I'm like just shooting in.
*  And then I was like, man, there's still something wrong with my eye.
*  And then I ended up going to the doctor like two days later because I thought it was just a scratch cornea or something.
*  But it ended up being like a detached lens.
*  Oh, Jesus.
*  So the whole lens, they had to like take out and then like sew back in.
*  Yeah.
*  And it was my eye was like super bloodshot red for like two weeks.
*  And then I ended up doing like a weigh in show with the UFC.
*  I've heard pay per view and everybody's like posting pictures of me like, oh, look at somebody farting on his pillow because he has a red eye.
*  And they're like making fun of me.
*  And I was like, I'm like crying myself in my room.
*  I don't got pink eye.
*  It's so true.
*  How long did it take to recover from that?
*  That one is wasn't as long.
*  That one is it was that blood was still in there for like a month.
*  The test retinal is the hardest one.
*  That one is like eight weeks of not doing absolutely nothing.
*  And I have to be like this.
*  My head sideways for a full eight weeks.
*  Really?
*  Yeah. And have like a bubble in your eye the whole time.
*  And then even when I'm watching TV, I have to like put my head in a massage chair.
*  Oh, wow.
*  And there's like a mirror at the top.
*  So I aimed the mirror at the TV and I can't do nothing.
*  Wow.
*  But like keep my head down or sideways.
*  And how long did you have to stay like that for?
*  It was like eight weeks.
*  Whoa.
*  Yeah.
*  So you're lying.
*  Did you go to sleep in a massage chair?
*  Yeah, I had to sleep.
*  I had to sleep with my face down in that massage chair the whole time.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah, it was that was the hardest thing.
*  How hard is it to sleep like that?
*  And I'm a back sleeper too.
*  So I hate sleeping on my stomach.
*  So it was like the worst two months of my life.
*  And then you're like, you don't know if you're going to be able to train after that and fight after that because the doctors looking at me like I'm stupid.
*  I'm telling them I'm going back to the gym.
*  And yeah, it was rough.
*  Doctors always want you to stop doing what you're doing.
*  Yeah.
*  How'd you hurt your shoulder?
*  Jiu-jitsu.
*  Oh, you need to quit that.
*  They always say.
*  Yeah.
*  They love to give you surgery.
*  And I just like there's no form of rehab or like exercises I could do.
*  They love to give you surgery.
*  Right away.
*  But even with the eye, I like I'm so afraid to even go to the doctor in general.
*  So like I was avoiding it at all costs.
*  So I would like see like a little black dot inside of my eye and I'm still training.
*  I'm like whatever.
*  And I was supposed to go with Jared to Brazil when he fought Charles Oliveira.
*  And I had my ticket booked and everything.
*  And then like the week before I'm sparring with them.
*  And then all of a sudden that black dot turned into like a black sheet and it went full black.
*  And I'm just like, I think I should go to a doctor now.
*  And then they were like, you got to go under the knife right away.
*  So it was like I had to get surgery right there.
*  Yeah.
*  I had a friend of mine who had a detached retina and he didn't go in quick enough and he lost most of his vision in that eye.
*  Yeah.
*  He had a bunch of surgeries.
*  They could never fix it.
*  He just he said that whoever told him that it wasn't a detached retina,
*  fucked him because if he had known right away when he went in to check it that it was a detached retina,
*  he would have been able to immediately get surgery and they would have saved it.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the hard part because you always think about Michael Bisping.
*  You're looking at him like, I want to be that guy.
*  Exactly.
*  And I was like.
*  How gangster is that motherfucker?
*  That dude fought 10 times in the UFC with one eyeball.
*  That's wild.
*  He couldn't see.
*  He memorized the fucking eye chart.
*  I literally had I had moments where I'm looking at myself like, am I going to have to do that?
*  Am I going to have to figure out something to do to do this?
*  Yeah.
*  Well, how about fucking what's his face?
*  The pirate shot a bullet.
*  Yeah.
*  Sharable.
*  Yeah.
*  That's crazy.
*  That guy's crazy.
*  He's only got one eye.
*  But it's wild, right?
*  Because I mean, he still looks like he sees everything when he's fighting.
*  Right.
*  Distance management is incredible.
*  It makes you think how good was that motherfucker with two eyes?
*  They can fight that good with one eye?
*  I fought in Abu Dhabi my first time there when when it could be fought Dustin Poirier.
*  And then he was just like a fan and he came up to me and he said, I'm going to be in the UFC.
*  And I remember the picture with him because he like tagged me.
*  And obviously, you can't forget that face.
*  Right.
*  But when I saw him like undefeated, killed him, I'm like, bro, dang, he wasn't lying.
*  He is a beast.
*  He's a beast.
*  Yeah.
*  I watched him fight before he was ever in the UFC when he was on other organizations.
*  And I was like, Jesus Christ, this guy can kick.
*  He kicks like you're thinking he's going to get tired from all that kicking and he does not get tired.
*  Yeah.
*  It's wild.
*  The volume of kicks.
*  He reminds you a lot of Yair.
*  You know, Yair is like one of those guys like, yo, you better stop thinking about kicking with him.
*  Kick it with Yair Rodriguez.
*  You better figure out a way to get past that shit because that guy can kick in a weird way.
*  I train with Yair and like even just like light sparring.
*  I don't even want to like play with him because he just comes from all different angles.
*  Yeah.
*  But he's so good at like he'll get so close.
*  It'll be like right here and he'll just pull it.
*  Yeah.
*  I think that's where I learned a lot from him.
*  And then just like when you're going with somebody who flows like that and knows how to move like that, it makes you more creative too.
*  Right.
*  Because you're not so tense.
*  You're worried about getting knocked out.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  That's the best kind of sparring.
*  But it's like with a guy like Yair, if you're going to fight a guy like Yair, you got to find some Taekwondo champion and bring it out.
*  But even then they're not going to know how to punch that good.
*  Yeah.
*  They're not going to know how to wrestle.
*  So you're going to be missing part of it because Yair can submit a lot of people.
*  He's fucking wicked off his back.
*  His triangle is fast as fuck.
*  People don't know how good he is.
*  And even his wrestling is really good.
*  Yeah.
*  But when he puts it all together.
*  But I think even when he gets in there, it's just like so much.
*  Right.
*  He puts so much energy into everything.
*  Yeah.
*  That sometimes it leaves openings for guys to like take him down and hold them down.
*  And like if I'm a guy fighting him, I was like, bro, I don't want to give this guy any distance or any room.
*  Yeah.
*  That style is just so taxing.
*  You got to for people that don't see the difference is two things in the octagon that are like probably the most taxing that you wouldn't really guess.
*  The biggest one is the clinch, bro.
*  You see guys just get drained after the first round in the clinch and they go back to the corner and then everything's coming slower.
*  The punches are coming slower.
*  The footwork looks slower reaction time.
*  So they'll take a shot that maybe they could have got away from because they just don't want to move.
*  Yeah.
*  We literally like do this in the gym where it's like, all right, let's do 20 pushups and then just hand fight for three minutes.
*  And then we start sparring.
*  It's like little stuff like that because that's when you get lactic acid in your arms.
*  You're tired.
*  Now let's see you throw punches right now.
*  And it'll stop people from actually like throwing hard at practice.
*  It'll make you want to conserve your energy and stuff.
*  But yeah, that feeling when you're in there and you can't lift up your arms like Damien Maia shot on me like 30 times.
*  And it's the third round.
*  I was like, bro, my arms are like dead right now.
*  So if he does take me down, I'm going to be in a bad spot because my arms are so heavy.
*  And Damien Maia, that guy had that creepy grappling strength where he would get a hold of the guys.
*  And he'd be like, what is happening here?
*  Like, how is this guy so fucking strong, especially at 170?
*  Bro, Damien Maia at 170 was terrifying.
*  People keep forgetting, man.
*  They do keep forgetting.
*  He got fucked in the Kamaru Usman fight.
*  He got fucked.
*  He got fucked.
*  He got to Kamaru's back.
*  He had one hook in standing up and they fucking separated them.
*  It is one of the greatest tragedies and travesties in the history of the sport.
*  That one positional change.
*  That is a terrible.
*  I don't know what referee it was.
*  I don't want to call him out.
*  People make mistakes.
*  But for Damien Maia, he got fucked because he had Kamaru's back.
*  And Kamaru's only loss up to that point was a very naked choke in his first fight.
*  Yeah.
*  And Kamaru was nowhere near the grappler in terms of submissions that Damien was.
*  Damien was set traps.
*  He will do shit to you.
*  And he just gets a hold of the guy.
*  Like what he did to Neil Magne.
*  Like Damien gets a hold of dudes and you're like, what is happening here?
*  Yeah.
*  This is a different kind of squeeze, man.
*  Yeah.
*  And he got fucked.
*  He got totally fucked.
*  But that's crazy, right?
*  Because a lot of fights could change off of one ref or one judge could change the whole thing.
*  Everything could have changed from that fight.
*  Everything could have changed.
*  So let's imagine the judge doesn't do that.
*  There is a 30% likelihood Kamaru is going to get him to the ground and strangle him.
*  Now, really legitimately, you're looking at prime time Damien Maia in the worst possible position.
*  One hook in, he's got your back.
*  How are you shaking him off?
*  Yeah.
*  You got a 30% chance of shaking him off.
*  You're stuck.
*  You got a good chance of holding off until the end of the round.
*  If you can't let, if you could, you might be able to stop him from advancing, but it's perilous.
*  This is a terrible position you're in.
*  Damien Maia is on your back and the referee is like, break it up.
*  There's no action here.
*  Like, are you a champion street fighter?
*  Like it's the same shit.
*  Like, what are you doing?
*  This is the sport.
*  The sport is this guy is a professional strangler and he's finally gotten a hold of this guy.
*  Oh, boo.
*  The casuals are booing.
*  So you're going to separate it.
*  This is, it's the worst for me, the biggest travesty I've ever seen in MMA.
*  That was number one.
*  There's probably been a few.
*  If I really had to go over all of them, I'd probably find a few other ones that were right up there.
*  They're like a top 10.
*  I mean, even Leon against Kamau too when Kamau was on top of him and the ref stood them up because the crowd was booing.
*  Right. And then he got a head kick.
*  Right.
*  Right.
*  It's like, bro, he's on top of the whole five rounds, but now you want him to stand them up because crowd's booing right now.
*  I believe in no standups.
*  Yeah.
*  I know it's boring.
*  I don't give a fuck.
*  No standups.
*  No standups.
*  I go a step further.
*  No standups.
*  No standups.
*  And I think the fight should resume exactly what position you were in at the end of the round.
*  Oh, that'll be the game changer.
*  That's a real fight though, right?
*  Yeah.
*  That's a real fight.
*  Like, how did you get back up to your feet?
*  Well, the round ended.
*  Yeah.
*  OK.
*  What are we doing?
*  We're cheating for the striker?
*  Because that seems like you're kind of cheating for the striker.
*  I know everyone's used to doing it this way, but if you want to look at it realistically, the striker has an advantage for the first few seconds of every fight.
*  Every fight.
*  The fight starts standing.
*  So in that perceived, that distance where the striker has his advantage, it starts off with the striker's advantage.
*  So if a grappler gets you to the ground, why do you get that advantage back in the next round?
*  Yeah.
*  And it's the hardest thing to get somebody down and figure it out.
*  So it's like...
*  And it's the hardest thing to get up.
*  Yeah.
*  So if you can never get up, that's tough shit.
*  Yeah.
*  Tough shit.
*  It's on you.
*  It's on you.
*  That's the sport.
*  The sport is not, boo, stand them up, just bleed.
*  You know?
*  Here it is.
*  Look at this.
*  Let's look at this again.
*  Take it back from the beginning.
*  So Damien gets the clinch, right?
*  And Camaro's got an overhook on the left arm, and he's defending so far.
*  So Damien's working towards the takedown.
*  Damien sneaks that leg in, and now Camaro starts to get in trouble, because Damien takes that left arm.
*  He goes all the way over and cinches the way.
*  So now he's pretty deep.
*  The thing that's saving Camaro here is his right arm.
*  That wizard on his right arm is the thing that's saving him.
*  But he's in danger.
*  Now he's in much more danger, because now Damien has the hook, and now Damien's pulling that arm over the top of Camaro's wizard.
*  So he'll connect his arms if the referee lets him.
*  What he wants to do is connect his hands in front of Camaro.
*  Camaro does not want that.
*  They're hand fighting right here.
*  But this is a dangerous spot for Camaro, because the only thing that's saving him is that wizard.
*  Without that wizard, he's fucked right now.
*  And he knows it, and he's strong as fuck, and he's holding on to that wizard with everything he's got.
*  But Damien is just slowly inching.
*  And he's putting leverage with his leg.
*  He's using that left hook.
*  Look, he's further. Now he's even further.
*  Now he can punch him.
*  He's even further.
*  So he's progressing.
*  So he has gotten to a spot where the referee is telling him, I guess he's grabbing gloves.
*  The referee's saying, just got to grab the wrist.
*  And he's closer to doing like a twister.
*  Look, he's even closer now.
*  Now it's even better.
*  Now it's even better.
*  So now Damien is trying to figure out when he can get his right hook in and what he's doing with his left arm.
*  So the wizard is still holding that left arm in place.
*  But Damien at one point in time had sort of threatened to creep it up over the top of Camaro's left shoulder.
*  And that's what he wants to do here.
*  So he wants to put all this pressure on, make Camaro do something to defend all the leverage he's putting on his legs, defend these punches.
*  He's setting up little traps, just trying to open up the space so that he could get that right hook in and that left arm over the top.
*  So he is on the back now, like fully on the back.
*  And then the referee stops him.
*  Wow. And this is the first round when they're still dry.
*  Bro, in fucking sane that this referee did this.
*  In fucking sane.
*  A travesty.
*  An unfair advantage for Camaro for sure.
*  And then Camaro caught him with the left hand or right hand.
*  He's catching with jabs.
*  He shouldn't be in this position now.
*  Camaro should be still trying to fight out his way out of that clinch.
*  And guess what?
*  He might not have fought his way out of that clinch.
*  He was like six steps to checkmate.
*  He was pretty close.
*  Six out of ten he was in.
*  It's crazy because it's the first round.
*  So it's like the crowd is booing.
*  It's like, bro, he just got to this spot this early.
*  What? Damien punched his butt?
*  So you're going to give you don't think a butt punch hurts?
*  Like he's trying to do something to get Camaro to react.
*  He's trying to get movement out of him.
*  Yeah, you want him to make the mistake.
*  Yeah.
*  Travesty.
*  Yeah.
*  Now that I look at that, I'm like, that's wild.
*  Travesty.
*  Now imagine.
*  Damien Maia submits him.
*  The world changes.
*  Camaro goes to that next fight.
*  Now everybody's looking to submit him.
*  Things change.
*  He's not the boogeyman anymore.
*  Somebody just tapped him.
*  Maybe his confidence goes down a little bit.
*  Maybe he doesn't get favorable matchup in his next fight.
*  Maybe he loses again.
*  Yeah.
*  Damien goes, gets the belt.
*  Yes.
*  Damien gets the belt.
*  Like things happen, man.
*  Weird things happen.
*  Weird things happen in the sport.
*  You know, that's why it's so incredible when someone reaches the title.
*  When you actually do it, you become Islam Makachev.
*  You become Bala Muhammad.
*  You get all the way up there and you win the title.
*  There's so many hurdles.
*  Like you've lost fights.
*  Yeah.
*  The eye poke with Leon was crazy.
*  You've had bad moments.
*  And to get all past that and get to the title.
*  Yeah.
*  Just thinking back to like all your ups and downs.
*  Yeah.
*  You're at the journey in general and you're like, why did this happen?
*  Or why did that happen?
*  Especially after a lot.
*  I'm a terrible loser.
*  So you're like, why is this happening to me?
*  But then now that I look back at it and thinking about the stuff that I changed.
*  And then I started doing this more.
*  I started fixing this.
*  And now it just like made me the fighter I am today.
*  And it's like, I'm glad those downs happened because now the ups feel so good.
*  And like nobody could take that away, right?
*  Like the mountain I climbed was way higher than anybody else climbed.
*  It was a lot harder than anybody else climbed.
*  There's a lot to that.
*  Yeah.
*  There's a lot to that.
*  There's a lot to that because the guys that come up real fast and like super talented
*  and just fuck everybody up and never get tested.
*  Like it's I think for some of those guys, it's harder to maintain that motivation
*  because you don't know the downs.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, like they just they have a belief in themselves.
*  Like, you know, BJ Penn is a good example of that in my opinion.
*  I always put BJ in the category of one of the greatest of all time.
*  I always say you got to look at BJ in his prime.
*  You have to look at BJ when he was beating Sean Shirk.
*  BJ when he beat Joe Daddy Stephenson, BJ was a monster, man, just a monster.
*  He had crazy flexibility, unbelievable balance.
*  You could try to take him down.
*  He would hop around on one leg like he had two.
*  It was nuts, man.
*  But BJ was so fucking talented that I think BJ didn't really like to work that hard.
*  You know, he didn't really get up for it as much as like some of the other guys that weren't as talented.
*  And when BJ did wasn't his prime, that's when he was training with the Marinovich's.
*  That's what he's doing.
*  That's what he's doing.
*  Those crazy plyometric workouts.
*  And so we had this insane gas tank with all the talent of a BJ Penn.
*  Yeah.
*  And like you said, people forget how good he was.
*  These new age fans, they've never seen him before.
*  They never saw him fight.
*  They forget.
*  They think he's going to fight for a losing streak.
*  Like Tyron Woodley, the same kind of thing.
*  You think about them only when they're at the end of their career.
*  You don't think about how good they were.
*  Nobody can maintain that forever.
*  It's not possible.
*  It's not possible.
*  Habib said it from the beginning, right?
*  He said, you're always going to lose.
*  There's a time for your thing.
*  He said it about Kamaru.
*  He said about Tony Ferguson.
*  He said these guys, they're going to learn the hard way.
*  And for me, he said, if I stayed in, I'd probably end up losing sometime.
*  I don't think you would lose, but yeah, like he said, you're thinking like I could still go with them.
*  And I'm looking at this guy like, bro, you could be the heavyweight champion right now.
*  It's like nuts.
*  What does he weigh now?
*  I think he's probably like 200 because he rolls consistently with everybody.
*  He says I have to jog 30 minutes a day.
*  He always is on the treadmill at least 30 minutes, but just like him and Grapplin, it's wild.
*  Because I just be like, it was when I first got the fight announced from Dana White,
*  I was over there in New Jersey training with Islam for his fight when he was fighting Poirier.
*  And then like they announced it and I'm like, Habib was like, I'll come with me over here to train.
*  And then he's just killing me, like literally like throwing me around.
*  And I'm just like getting murdered.
*  Then my coach tells me, hey, you see Dana White announced you got the title fight.
*  And I'm looking at myself like, really?
*  All right.
*  What's crazy is he's still in his prime.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what's crazy.
*  Like he get out 29 and 0 in his prime.
*  It's like I'm done.
*  I made a promise to my mom and do it on top.
*  No injuries.
*  Nobody does that.
*  Nobody does that.
*  Only the greats, right?
*  Even I mean, GSP did it.
*  But but GSP came back and he fought when he was older.
*  He fought Bisping at 85, you know, and GSP.
*  His you know, I mean, he had gone through some wars and at the end, that last one, he was just like, I need some time off, you know.
*  Yeah.
*  I think a lot of these fighters, they they need the time off, but they don't take it.
*  And they try to rush back in after losses.
*  And it just adds up.
*  You see it with Tony Ferguson.
*  Right.
*  Prime example.
*  I think after that, that Gagey fight, that should have been time off.
*  That should have been like, all right, let me take a year off, not do nothing.
*  But you want to rush back in there.
*  And then all of a sudden, the losses start adding up.
*  Your your body's taking damage.
*  And here's another one.
*  So let's imagine Tony Ferguson doesn't trip over those wires backstage.
*  So he's about to fight Khabib for the title in Madison Square Garden.
*  He trips over some wires backstage and tears his knee apart.
*  Just a freak accident.
*  Yeah.
*  Just a freak accident that could happen to anybody.
*  Tears his knee apart, has to get knee surgery, misses the title fight.
*  Al Iaquinta steps in, has a good fight with him.
*  And Tony Ferguson, the one guy that we were always like, how would Tony do?
*  Because he in his prime, people forget in his prime that motherfucker was terrifying.
*  He had a long ass win streak and fucking everybody up.
*  He was cutting people, strangling people.
*  He was a beast, dude.
*  Tony Ferguson was a fucking monster.
*  But people forgot.
*  They forgot.
*  They forgot.
*  They only see Tony Ferguson now when he got knocked out by Chandler.
*  They see Tony Ferguson now when Patti Pimblitt beats him.
*  Like you don't understand.
*  He's 40 whatever he is years old.
*  Like he's natural.
*  The body just can't do what the mind wants it to do anymore.
*  And you're looking for that one point where at least a coach, family or somebody that tells them like, you're done.
*  But you want to maybe you want to end on a winning note or you want to just like.
*  I think these guys just like it.
*  They want to fight and that's all they know.
*  Yeah.
*  It's it's different in different people.
*  Like some people get out and they go, I think I did enough.
*  I'm out.
*  And they hold to it like Khabib or like Andre Ward.
*  Andre Ward's another one goes out on time on top.
*  Gold medalist in the Olympics, two division world champions like that's it.
*  I'm good.
*  I think they offered him when Canelo fought Kovalev when he knocked out Kovalev and won the light heavyweight title.
*  They were saying maybe Andre Ward would come back and they were going to throw a lot of money at him.
*  And I think he considered it, but I think he said I serve boxing better in the position that I am.
*  So here's a guy, Olympic gold medalist, two division world champion, speaks perfectly.
*  Nothing wrong with him at all.
*  You know, very religious man, never swears.
*  Like I did a podcast with him.
*  He got upset that I said the F word.
*  He did.
*  Like he called me afterwards.
*  Like I didn't know you were going to be swearing.
*  Oh, wow.
*  Because he said he would want people like from his church to listen.
*  Yeah.
*  So now he can't say, yeah, he's got to say, don't listen to that one.
*  Oh, he's got a potty mouth.
*  I thought he's a boxing champion.
*  I was talking to him like a regular dude.
*  But he's but he's one of the wise ones that said, that's it.
*  You know, everybody else comes back, man.
*  Marvin Hagler.
*  He was another one.
*  Never came back.
*  So that's it.
*  I'm done.
*  Yeah.
*  But Ward, I think even I said in the commentary, the way he breaks stuff down, his new book was was so good.
*  Just him.
*  It's like hearing his stories.
*  Why?
*  Yes, it's a crazy story.
*  But him and Canelo would be crazy.
*  Oh, that would have been crazy.
*  Yeah, I would love to see that fight.
*  I want to see Canelo and Benavides like, come on, Saudi Arabia.
*  Throw that throw that money.
*  Throw that money.
*  Let's see that fight.
*  Because if Crawford, if they're not going to have him fight Crawford, which I did want to see, I did want to see.
*  Even though I know it's crazy.
*  It's a giant weight jump.
*  Yeah.
*  But Benavides is not a weight jump.
*  That's the right weight.
*  And that guy's a killer.
*  And it makes the most sense.
*  It makes the most sense.
*  But and Canelo's like, give me $200 million.
*  And I can see them just offering it.
*  Let me just go to my bank account.
*  I'll just give you that check real quick.
*  Saudi Arabia guy.
*  I hope they I hope that Benavides and him do fight and I hope it's at 168 because I think that's like Benavides is best division.
*  I mean, he only fought he fought that last fight at 75 against a good guy.
*  Yeah.
*  And he won the fight, but he didn't look like the same guy that he looks like at 68.
*  I don't think that power carries quite as much with those bigger guys.
*  It's a little bit of a step to step up.
*  You know, like that there's very few guys that keep that power as they keep going up and up and up and wait.
*  It's just and there's so many weight classes in boxing.
*  Right. Yeah.
*  You could be like you said, if for Canelo and him stuff fight that makes sense.
*  So for him, he's like, I need to find the biggest fight in this.
*  All right.
*  Let me move up a couple more pounds here.
*  Yeah.
*  And then you think it's not a big jump, but those pounds make a difference.
*  It makes a difference.
*  It makes a difference.
*  But for Crawford, I think he just wants the big money fight.
*  Like, what is the big money?
*  Funny Canelo's the big money fight.
*  You know, Crawford is one of the best ever.
*  He's 36.
*  He's like, maybe this is, you know, let me get one big money fight and get the fuck out of here.
*  Yeah.
*  But he's got boots and it's, you know, knock on his door too, which is another amazing fight, but super dangerous.
*  You know, like just like Benevides is dangerous boots and this is very fucking dangerous, very dangerous.
*  There's always somebody coming right.
*  Right.
*  And these guys who've been at the top so long, you're like, all right, let me get somebody that's on my level Canelo.
*  Yeah.
*  He's been in the game just as long as me.
*  And all right, let's just do this for his paycheck and then move on.
*  I think when they get to a certain level and they realize they only have a few fights left, they want the big money fights.
*  And Canelo is obviously the biggest money fight.
*  Even though Boots Ennis is a great fighter, most people don't know who he is yet.
*  Yeah.
*  And with Canelo, everybody knows who Canelo is.
*  You get the Canelo fight.
*  That's red panties night.
*  Yeah.
*  And then they're like, you're in.
*  Let's go.
*  That's I mean, that's the John Jones effect with Steve.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  Not a lot of people know where Aspinall is yet.
*  Right.
*  I mean, the real fans know him, but it's like everybody knows Steve.
*  Right.
*  Everybody knows he was one of the greatest heavyweights to ever do it.
*  It's a great thing if John can beat him on his resume.
*  You know, it's one more notch that John beat the most accomplished heavyweight of all time.
*  But here's the thing.
*  Everybody's sleeping on Steve.
*  Here's the thing about heavyweights.
*  Heavyweights mature later and they get compromised later, too.
*  Like, heavyweights can fight.
*  Like, George Foreman won the heavyweight title at 45 years old.
*  And that was in the natural days.
*  I think there's maybe not natural.
*  I mean, I don't know what George is doing, but I was thinking of Vanderhoof.
*  You know, like, maybe there's something going on.
*  But my point is that like heavyweight fighters, I think because there's not as much movement, it's a different thing.
*  The body matures.
*  It takes longer.
*  They're just bigger human beings.
*  I could see a guy that's in his 40s still fighting elite.
*  And we haven't seen Stipe since he got knocked out.
*  So we saw that fight against Francis where Francis just looked unstoppable.
*  Francis knocks him out.
*  We haven't seen Stipe in years now.
*  Like, when was the last time Stipe fought?
*  I remember it was at the apex and it was in the middle of the pandemic because there was no crowd.
*  Which was crazy to see a heavyweight title fight with no crowd.
*  It was nuts.
*  The pandemic days were wild.
*  Wild. Everybody's wearing a mask, hanging over their nose.
*  It's all so stupid.
*  Francis, right?
*  Yes.
*  So March 27, 2021.
*  2021, dude.
*  2021.
*  And we're getting real close to 2025.
*  So 2025, as this fight happens in November, 2025 is just a fucking month away.
*  That's a long ass time.
*  But it's also a long ass time with no head injuries.
*  It's a long ass time without getting two or three fights.
*  A serial gun fight.
*  Another fight.
*  This fight. That fight.
*  It's a long time without getting beat up.
*  And you don't know if he comes as a different version himself.
*  What if he's been working on some stuff?
*  Yes.
*  I mean, if he knows he's fighting John Jones and he probably knew probably for the last year and a half.
*  I'm just studying one guy for a year and a half just focused on him.
*  Exactly.
*  It changes a lot of stuff.
*  And, you know, he's had time to rest.
*  Like, let the chin recover.
*  Because that's a, you know.
*  I think Daniel Cormier landed the picture perfect right hand when he knocked out Stipe.
*  But I also think Stipe was probably beaten up from that Francis fight.
*  That Francis fight was not much.
*  I mean, I don't remember how many months.
*  How many months was there between Francis, Stipe fighting Francis and then Stipe fighting DC?
*  Seven months?
*  That's not enough time.
*  And a year before the previous fight.
*  Yeah.
*  A year before, that's a different thing.
*  The Francis fight was the damage.
*  Francis was, in the first round in particular, he landed some big shots.
*  He was fucking scary as shit, dude.
*  So I think him coming in and fighting Daniel, I got to imagine he took some heavy blows in that fight.
*  And, you know, even if he didn't lose, he had to have gotten some damage.
*  Like, he might have been concussed.
*  He got hit hard.
*  No doubt.
*  Yeah.
*  Hard in that fight.
*  And then, do you go right back into training?
*  No.
*  You should take a long ass time with no contact at all and let everything heal up.
*  And he probably didn't get a chance to do that.
*  I mean, I think that's also Volkanovsky after Islam.
*  Yeah.
*  I think that was his biggest mistake, right?
*  Huge mistake.
*  Two mistakes.
*  One, you don't fight Islam on 10 days notice.
*  You just can't.
*  That just doesn't make any sense.
*  That's crazy.
*  He's so hard to beat.
*  He's so good.
*  If he's not the best, it's you and him for the best, pound for pound.
*  And you're going to risk that on 10 days?
*  That's crazy.
*  And that, again, changes the course of his career, right?
*  That's wild, right?
*  Imagine if he doesn't take that fight.
*  He says, I can't.
*  I'm ready for Ilya Toporia.
*  That guy's coming.
*  And he knows how fucking dangerous Ilya is.
*  And so he doesn't take that fight.
*  And then he goes in fresh against Ilya, and you have a much better fight.
*  Yeah.
*  Who knows who would have won?
*  But you've got to think he was compromised from that.
*  He got head kicked.
*  Head kicked.
*  Shin to the dome.
*  Which is just, for sure, it's going to rattle you for a long time.
*  When you're just getting put out cold like that.
*  And especially, he probably cut a lot of weight to get to that point.
*  Because he looked kind of flabby in that Islam fight.
*  So you're taking a fight on 10 days notice.
*  There's not a lot of guys that are around their weight class anyway.
*  So they're cutting a lot.
*  Then you have to go, all right, now I'm going to fight Islam,
*  who's number one pound for pound, and then that head kick.
*  Islam looked like Michelangelo sculpted him.
*  He's so big.
*  And he's so strong, so good.
*  What does he weigh?
*  What does he weigh like normal?
*  Like right now, if you called him up, what do you weigh, brother?
*  I would say at least minimum like 185, 190.
*  The fuck out of here.
*  He's 210 pounds.
*  No, Islam.
*  That guy's 250 pounds.
*  His strength feels like 255.
*  That's what I hear.
*  But that's the thing with them.
*  They're always training.
*  No matter what they're doing, they always at least run once a day or grapple.
*  So he's losing roughly 30 pounds to make 55.
*  From the start, I would say.
*  Yeah.
*  He's big.
*  That's about as big as you can get and keep doing that.
*  That's big.
*  Yeah.
*  And he's tall.
*  He's lengthy.
*  And he has power.
*  He could go up to 70 easily, I think.
*  Yeah, easily.
*  He's got real power now on his feet, which is a new addition over the last X amount of years.
*  His stand up has gotten elite.
*  He knocked down Olivera.
*  He had Olivera in real trouble.
*  The Volkonoski hit kick though.
*  And it was also the way he set it up.
*  He kept kicking to the body.
*  Oh my God.
*  Yeah.
*  I think people just assume that all he's going to do is wrestle.
*  But then when you see him go under and outstrike somebody, he even boxed with Poirier.
*  He has some really good hands in there with him.
*  And people are like, oh, he can strike too.
*  But his grappling is just as good.
*  He can do everything.
*  He's as good as it gets.
*  He's as good as it gets.
*  He's the most complete fighter on the roster because he submits people.
*  He submitted Poirier in the final round.
*  Incredible.
*  Incredible submission.
*  But he was winning that fight already.
*  But then he can also knock you out.
*  He literally does everything.
*  He's one of the best wrestlers in the sport.
*  His top control and his squeeze is insane.
*  Yeah.
*  Remember when we tapped out Drew Dover?
*  He got a hold of Drew Dover.
*  It's like Drew Dover had zero chance of moving.
*  He wasn't going anywhere.
*  He was just crushed.
*  It was like he was fighting a man twice his size.
*  I was just bringing it up when I talk about Dan Hooker.
*  He just went to war with Gamrot.
*  Exactly.
*  And Islam just took him down and tapped him out within the first two or three minutes.
*  And tapped him out to the point where you're like, please tap, please tap.
*  Fucking tap.
*  Dude, just tap.
*  Don't let him do it.
*  Because it looked like he was going to break his fucking arm apart.
*  It's so funny because Habib will get guys in there.
*  And he's the type that will grapple and just have a conversation as he's grappling.
*  But he had Ali in a camora and he's laughing and Ali's tapping.
*  And he's just like, haha brother, give me coffee.
*  I'm like, bro, I think you're going to break his arm at some point.
*  That's a terrible break too, that spiral break.
*  It's the worst.
*  They're so strong and effortless with them.
*  Their bodies move crazy.
*  I remember Michael Johnson.
*  Khabib got Michael Johnson in that camora.
*  And I was like, Jesus, please tap, Michael.
*  God, tap, please.
*  Just tap.
*  I was squirming in my chair because I'm waiting to hear, crap.
*  Because I've seen that.
*  No Garry fight with Frank Meier.
*  You see his arms, you hear the snap.
*  And you see him look over at his arm and his arm is halfway hanging.
*  That's the scary part about the whole thing.
*  So scary.
*  That's such a scary break.
*  Because this arm is never the same again.
*  It's never the same again.
*  No matter what.
*  They're going to screw things in there and bolt things.
*  All your muscles have been cut.
*  All your nerves are fucked up.
*  It's never going to be the same arm.
*  And then you have guys that are crazy enough to keep fighting after that.
*  With a broken arm.
*  Yeah, they don't give a fuck.
*  Break my arm.
*  Tim Sylvia.
*  When Frank Meier broke his arm.
*  Oh, here it is with no gear.
*  Oh, Jesus.
*  You've got to make me, look at this.
*  And he looks down at his arm like, ah.
*  God damn.
*  Please, ladies and gentlemen, tap.
*  Please tap.
*  Sometimes you have to tap.
*  I know, I know.
*  But sometimes you've got to tap for the future.
*  Did you see that guy, Mikey Musimichi fought in one FC and he destroyed his leg?
*  Yeah.
*  The guy wouldn't tap.
*  This fucking guy's an animal.
*  He would not tap.
*  And I was tapping at home.
*  I couldn't believe it.
*  He broke his leg like three times.
*  He just kept breaking his knee.
*  Left and right and ripping it apart.
*  I'm watching his knee.
*  I'm like, that's destroyed.
*  There's your LCL.
*  Look at this.
*  This is so horrible.
*  Oh, my God.
*  Ah.
*  Like right now, his leg is destroyed.
*  His leg right now is fully destroyed.
*  It's totally twisted.
*  All his ligaments are fucked.
*  He couldn't walk after this fight.
*  I mean, look at his heel is totally the wrong way.
*  His knee is twisted completely around.
*  That is horrible.
*  Oh, he's going that way with it.
*  Oh, my God.
*  The dude never tapped.
*  The dude got his leg destroyed and never fucking tapped.
*  But he's probably never going to be the same again.
*  Mikey has to have some craziness inside of him just to keep tapping.
*  He's a evil little man.
*  He's a really, really, really nice guy.
*  Yeah.
*  But he's also got a switch.
*  Yeah.
*  There's a switch and he gets into that octagon.
*  And what's that?
*  Why did you do that to me?
*  That's what Mikey said to him.
*  Yeah.
*  He felt bad that the guy wouldn't tap.
*  It was a crazy demonstration.
*  But that poor guy, I mean, I got to thank his.
*  What kind of surgery?
*  Find out what kind of surgery that guy had.
*  I hate leg locks in general.
*  Even at practice, I'll tell you guys.
*  If you're going to put leg locks, I'm just going to tap.
*  I'm not even going to play it.
*  Well, I came up before leg locks.
*  So I didn't learn leg locks until late in my jujitsu journey.
*  I was already a black belt before leg locks became the big thing.
*  When we already knew about them.
*  I had seen Dean Lister use them.
*  When Eddie went to Abu Dhabi, I went down there with him and Dean Lister was tapping
*  people.
*  Dean Lister was the first guy to really fuck a lot of guys up with leg locks.
*  And then he was like, I'm going to tap.
*  And then he was like, I'm going to tap.
*  And then he was like, I'm going to tap.
*  And then he was like, I'm going to tap.
*  I was already a black belt before leg locks became the big thing.
*  When we already knew about them.
*  Like I had seen Dean Lister use them.
*  When Eddie went to Abu Dhabi, I went down there with him and Dean Lister was tapping
*  people.
*  Dean Lister was the first guy to really like fuck a lot of guys up with leg locks.
*  And a few of those Luta-Levray guys were really good at leg locks.
*  They would do them.
*  But leg locks in jujitsu tournaments were booed.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, man.
*  Because they ruined people's knees and no one really knew how to defend them.
*  Torn ACL, torn MCL, torn meniscus and a broken ankle.
*  Oh my God.
*  That's wild.
*  It tore everything.
*  Mikey said, I'm sick to my stomach.
*  I never felt someone's leg explode like that in a match.
*  I've been training for 22 years.
*  I never broke someone's leg that much.
*  I broke it a lot of legs, but that leg exploded.
*  I didn't know what to do.
*  It was just disgusting and gross.
*  I really wish he tapped.
*  The result didn't change.
*  Now he's in the hospital.
*  So I don't know.
*  But what a worry he is for showing his will.
*  That's why you got to choke people.
*  You got to choke people.
*  They don't want to tap and they just go to sleep and that's OK.
*  That's Marcelo Garcia's route.
*  Marcelo Garcia never used Kimoras.
*  Because Marcelo Garcia, although of course he could do a Kimora, he never used Kimora
*  because he felt like Kimoras were like a strong man's move because you have to kind of yank
*  it and you're resisting the arm.
*  It's not perfect technique.
*  So Marcelo was all about grabbing your neck.
*  Like he had the nastiest guillotines.
*  Did you ever watch Marcelo?
*  Yeah.
*  Oh my God.
*  I was there live when he fought Shaolin in Abu Dhabi.
*  Oh my God.
*  Oh my God.
*  It was like, what was that dude, the Tasmanian devil from the cartoons?
*  That was like, yeah, yeah, spinning around him, getting his back and put him to sleep.
*  That's crazy.
*  Oh my God.
*  And nobody knew who Marcelo was.
*  That was what was crazy.
*  Like a lot of people respected him.
*  Everybody knew he's a black belt.
*  You know, Fabio Grigel lineage, solid lineage.
*  Everybody knew he was good.
*  But God damn killer killer.
*  Did you watch that million dollar tournament with Craig Jones?
*  I did.
*  Yeah, I did.
*  One match was really good in the semifinals with them two kids.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Rutollo and who was the other catty fight?
*  I forgot, but that was a crazy.
*  I think they said it's on YouTube as the greatest grappling match of all time.
*  Yeah, that was a wild one.
*  The Rutollo brothers are so good.
*  They're so good.
*  And again, look, 20 years old, 19 years old, just coming up.
*  The young ones, man.
*  Young and explosive and wild.
*  They do all kinds of crazy techniques.
*  They catch Darces from everywhere.
*  And I like the ring they did in.
*  Andrew Tackett, who's also a killer.
*  So it was an incredible match.
*  These guys just went at it.
*  I don't like that ring.
*  It's fun.
*  It's like something different.
*  I don't like it.
*  I don't like it because it's another obstacle.
*  I think they had it right before when there was no obstacles.
*  This is an obstacle.
*  This keeps you from being able to get up right.
*  It's a thing that you have to think about.
*  This is why I've said this before.
*  I apologize for everybody who's heard it.
*  I think fighting should take place with no cage.
*  It would be easier to see.
*  And I think it should be on a basketball court.
*  And you fight in the center.
*  If you can have basketball in the same arenas
*  where we have UFCs, you take an enormous space,
*  you mat it up, you put security around it
*  so nobody can get in, and you put ropes up,
*  and guys step in and they fight right in front of everybody.
*  That would be epic.
*  No time limit.
*  No, I think you should have time limits.
*  I think you should even have rounds.
*  But if I was running things, this is what I'd do.
*  Number one, first thing I'd do, cover the fingertips.
*  Why are the fingertips open?
*  They don't have to be open.
*  All you need is the same UFC gloves right now
*  and extend the lever like a mitten,
*  the leather like a mitten over the tips of the front fingers
*  and pull it back in there.
*  I think it would help grappling.
*  I don't think it would hurt grappling.
*  So I don't think grapplers would have a problem with it.
*  It would have no difference at all when you're striking.
*  You would just pull it like a bad glove.
*  You know, like those old Everlast bad gloves?
*  But not even as thick.
*  Just have it.
*  So now you have one piece.
*  So you don't have nothing that can go in your eyeball.
*  Like we've seen fingers go in eyeballs before.
*  So that would be eliminated.
*  You would still have some abrasions of the eye.
*  You could still run into fingers like that.
*  It would suck.
*  It would suck less though.
*  It would suck less.
*  So that would be my first thing I would do.
*  Second thing I would do, wherever the fuck,
*  nobody gets stood up ever for any reason,
*  unless someone gets injured or some foul
*  or something happens wrong, somebody bites somebody,
*  some crazy shit, then stand people up.
*  And then I think you put them right back down
*  to the position after you take the point away
*  or whatever you're gonna do.
*  But once a guy gets you down,
*  it's your job to get back up.
*  And at the end of the round,
*  if you're on your back and he's mounted you,
*  you start the next round with him mounted you.
*  You put the arm in the exact same place.
*  He had an overhook on the right arm
*  and he's on top and he's got his hand on your bicep.
*  Okay, this is how the round ended.
*  This is how we start.
*  And everybody looks at the screen
*  and everybody looks at the guys
*  and they go three, two, one, fight.
*  That would be wild.
*  That would be real.
*  Yeah, that would be cool. That would be real.
*  Yeah. Because it's not five fights.
*  It's one fight.
*  It's one fight.
*  That's five rounds.
*  Why should it start on your feet every round?
*  That's crazy.
*  Why? Because that's how it is in boxing,
*  they come out of their corner.
*  Who fucking cares?
*  That's stupid.
*  Yeah.
*  Start them where they...
*  You gotta get better the same way you got sick.
*  You got taken down, you gotta get up.
*  Somebody got you down, you gotta get up.
*  Because if you don't get up, then he's winning.
*  He's figured out a way to hold you down.
*  You don't wanna be held down.
*  He's holding you down.
*  So he's winning.
*  Even if he's not doing any damage,
*  he's winning.
*  He's holding you down.
*  Everybody boo, boo.
*  So what?
*  So it'll affect your ticket sale.
*  So you'll get less money for pay-per-views.
*  So what?
*  But this is what real fighting is.
*  That's real.
*  That's the most pure version of the sport
*  that we could offer.
*  Giant, matted down space.
*  You make it so that you have security around it
*  so no fucking psychos can rush.
*  You put ropes up so people can't pass it.
*  Everybody's gonna have a clear line of sight,
*  no cages in the way.
*  You still have the big monitors and everything like that.
*  They fight in an enormous space
*  and you have a danger zone.
*  You got an outside danger zone.
*  And if you keep going into that fucking danger zone,
*  they take a point away.
*  If you get kicked in the nuts, take a point away.
*  You get poked in the eye, take a point away.
*  You grab the, well, grab the fence, I think,
*  take a point away too, but let's have no fence.
*  No fence.
*  So there's no way to take someone down
*  except taking them down.
*  You gotta actually take them down.
*  You can't get them up against the cage and trip them
*  because their back is against, no, no, no.
*  You have to take them down on a flat ground with no help.
*  And he's gotta get up without the cage.
*  He can't wall walk up to the cage
*  and press his back up and use the leverage.
*  Uh-uh, uh-uh, get up.
*  You're in the middle of the fucking matted area.
*  Get up.
*  I'm just imagining guys like MVP and Wonder Boy,
*  like to be able to catch those guys in a basketball court.
*  Hard, hard.
*  It'd be wild.
*  Chano Malley just, yeah.
*  Yeah, hard.
*  Great for them too.
*  Bad for them if they get taken down though.
*  Real bad.
*  Real bad.
*  Because now you have to actually be able to get up.
*  And you're stuck there.
*  And imagine getting up with Khabib on top of you.
*  Has anybody ever gotten up?
*  Dude, that guy gets on top of you.
*  You're fucked.
*  You gotta wait till the round's over.
*  Bro, like when we grapple,
*  the round will be over with and he'll still be going.
*  And he's like, no brother, you have to get up.
*  And I'm just like, bro, I can't, like, the bell rang, bro.
*  You gotta get up.
*  That's what I mean.
*  I just stay on top of you.
*  It'll be like a 15 minute round.
*  It'll be just like.
*  That's so crazy.
*  Non-stop is wild, yeah.
*  But that mentality is why that camp produces
*  so many assassins.
*  I was very impressed with Umar.
*  Very impressed.
*  Very impressed.
*  Because I always knew he was an elite kicker.
*  You know what I mean?
*  He's an elite striker too.
*  But to see him fight a guy like Sanhagen,
*  who's so complex, he does so many things well.
*  And to see him dominate that fight,
*  I was like, wow, that's really impressive.
*  That's really impressive.
*  Yeah, I think he still only has less than five fights
*  in the UFC.
*  He's still.
*  Yeah, he's incredible.
*  Starting.
*  Yo, I butchered his name one time.
*  So bad.
*  That was the first time.
*  I could see it all the time.
*  It couldn't get out of my mouth.
*  I don't know what it is.
*  Sometimes my mouth just don't work right.
*  And that's fine if you're doing a podcast.
*  You can just say it again.
*  But if you're saying it, guys,
*  I was like, nobody can do that.
*  Fuck.
*  I'm like, what did I say?
*  I felt so bad, because I really love the guy.
*  I think he's awesome.
*  And especially after the Sanhagen fight,
*  I think he's the most compelling contender
*  in that division after Murab.
*  So after Murab, I think he's got to get that shot.
*  Whoever wins.
*  And him against either one of those guys is sensational.
*  That's a sensational fight.
*  That's like an elite top.
*  That's like as good as we have to offer today
*  in terms of martial arts talent.
*  Yeah, 100%.
*  The way he did, like Sanhagen's one of my favorite fighters.
*  He's so good.
*  To see how good Umar did against them.
*  And didn't have really any moments of difficulty in there.
*  And I was like, he's elite.
*  Yeah, he's super elite.
*  You know, I think about Sanhagen.
*  One thing I think about is, here's a bummer.
*  TJ Dillshaw.
*  Like TJ Dillshaw, let's imagine that TJ Dillshaw
*  didn't blow out his shoulders.
*  Because TJ Dillshaw beat Sanhagen with one leg.
*  Yeah.
*  Which is crazy.
*  And he beat Sanhagen, Sanhagen, Sanhagen
*  that had fucked up Marlon Marais.
*  Sanhagen, Sanhagen.
*  Like the Sanhagen of today.
*  You know, that guy is fucking top of the food chain.
*  He's very good.
*  And TJ beat him with one leg.
*  And a fucked up shoulder.
*  His shoulder wasn't good back then either.
*  It was fucked up.
*  But he figured out a way to win.
*  It wasn't the most exciting fight.
*  But how could it be?
*  He had one ACL.
*  He blew his fucking knee apart.
*  But he still beat him.
*  That guy's had so many fucking injuries.
*  If you imagine TJ Dillshaw not having all those injuries.
*  And someone talking him out of going down to 25.
*  Yeah.
*  You see how big he is right now?
*  Bro, he's huge.
*  He's like 180 pounds.
*  It's wild.
*  I'm like, that's what I want to be.
*  I wish I was tighter with him.
*  Because I would have said, do not fucking do it.
*  Look at him now.
*  He's huge.
*  Yeah.
*  His piss would melt that US Sonnet Cup.
*  Just put him and Chad Maddads in a room.
*  And just have him like, duke it out.
*  Do a best body contest.
*  The votes like, takes.
*  But you got to think, man, how good Cody NoLove
*  was when he beat him.
*  When he stopped him.
*  Dude, TJ Dillshaw was a bad man.
*  Henen Barao was the pound for pound considerate
*  of a number one fighter in the world
*  when he was the Bantamweight champion.
*  A lot of people, he was in consideration.
*  And TJ just pieced him up.
*  And he did it like he was sparring.
*  He was all loose and relaxed.
*  And he had that, Dwayne Ludwig.
*  I don't know if you were trained with Dwayne?
*  No.
*  He's got an incredible system.
*  That bang muay thai system is one of the most complex
*  and well thought out striking systems I've ever seen.
*  He's a maniac.
*  He's got notebooks.
*  Like binders with all these moves locked in.
*  And if you watch Dwayne fight, though, it's so crazy.
*  Because he didn't fight that way.
*  Dwayne fought, he had kind of traditional.
*  Like a lot of muay thai, a lot of Dutch kickboxing style,
*  nasty striker.
*  But he didn't switch stances all the time and do like TJ.
*  But he figured that out.
*  He figured out that this is the way.
*  The constant switching and striking from each stance
*  and the constant footwork and movement, all these patterns,
*  that they would get guys to lead into certain positions
*  and do it.
*  It wasn't just smashing buttons like stylebender likes
*  to talk about.
*  Dwayne's thought about it as a real comprehensive striking
*  program.
*  TJ was his best pupil.
*  And TJ, when he fought Hanna Baral,
*  was showing that style in its world class form.
*  But people forget.
*  People forget how good TJ Dillashaw was.
*  They forget.
*  He has that fight with Cejudo.
*  He tests positive for EPO.
*  Because he's literally dying to make 125.
*  He looked like an Auschwitz concentration camp survivor.
*  He did.
*  He looked like they just opened the doors and let him out
*  of the concentration camp.
*  He had no skin on his face.
*  His face was just, it was just bones.
*  He looked terrible.
*  And TJ is a big guy for 35.
*  He's big.
*  He's a good, solid, perfect 35 pound frame.
*  And somehow or another, someone talked him into it
*  or he wanted to do it for the challenge.
*  Chasing that greatness.
*  Fuck that, man.
*  Fuck that kind of cut.
*  Because he had to be starving to death in camp.
*  So he must have been doing his camp
*  while he was starving, literally starving to death.
*  Your organs are shutting down.
*  Your brain's not working anymore.
*  And then when you're thinking about,
*  was the EPO just because of the weight cut?
*  Did he just do that?
*  That's what he said.
*  Right.
*  But then he's thinking if he was using it beforehand,
*  how good Cody Nola was before he fought him.
*  And after him beating Dominic Cruz,
*  that was like the best performance I've
*  ever seen in my life.
*  And then he goes and gets knocked out by him.
*  And then he says, because he was on EPO,
*  that changed your whole career.
*  It does.
*  It does change your whole career.
*  There's guys have accused him of doing stuff other than that.
*  And I don't know who's telling.
*  That's what he looked like.
*  Bro.
*  That's so crazy.
*  That is so crazy.
*  I wish I was his friend.
*  I wish I was tight with him back then.
*  And I wish he would have listened to someone who had said,
*  just don't do that, man.
*  Don't fucking do that.
*  You could be one of the all time greats at 35 and stay there.
*  But you also got to think, how many of his injuries
*  got amplified because of that weight cut?
*  How much body deterioration was he going through?
*  And then also going through camp.
*  So he's pushing hard.
*  He's wrestling.
*  He's hitting the mitts.
*  He's sparring.
*  All this while his body is deteriorating.
*  So all his mass is down.
*  All the muscle that's protecting his shoulders, which are.
*  His supraspinatus has been missing forever.
*  His supraspinatus has been ripped off the bone
*  from the beginning of his career.
*  We were just.
*  I was talking to a guy yesterday about weight cutting.
*  We were at the sushi spot.
*  Sushi by scratch.
*  And then the sushi guy who was rolling it, he was like,
*  I used to be a weight cutter in high school
*  when I was a wrestler.
*  And I had a heart surgery because I was cutting weight
*  since I was six years old.
*  My dad would make me cut weight.
*  And I was like, that'll change your whole life
*  because you started cutting at that young.
*  And he's like, bro, I had so many issues, problems
*  from there.
*  And it was just wrestling.
*  He said I wasn't even grappling or anything.
*  I was just wrestling since a kid.
*  My dad just made me cut weight since I was a kid.
*  It was like 109 pounds to like 90 pounds.
*  And I was like, why were you cutting weight that young?
*  So bad for you.
*  It stunts your growth, does a lot of wild shit to your body,
*  make your kidneys fail.
*  Changes your life.
*  Changes your life.
*  Yeah, and you don't grow up right.
*  It's like you're being poisoned from the time you're a kid.
*  Your body doesn't develop right.
*  Who knows what could do to this future of your life?
*  It might've taken a decade or two off of his life.
*  And it just burns you out in general.
*  You go to fighting after that.
*  Exactly.
*  You've been cutting weight since that long.
*  Now you're a fighter, now you have to cut weight.
*  Every single fighter I think has like an eating disorder
*  or something like that.
*  I'm like, I'm going to eat two now after.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm sure.
*  I'm sure.
*  Well, how much do you have to cut?
*  Me?
*  Like I get around to like 190.
*  And then when it's, when I'm in fight camp and I'm training,
*  I'm walking around at 185.
*  So like at 15 pounds, the most.
*  Yeah, but I keep a chef with me for like this last five weeks.
*  Ian Larios, he'd been with like DC, Kane and all them guys.
*  And he lives in my house for five weeks.
*  And I tell people, it changes your life.
*  Like you train so much better off it.
*  Cause he's giving you the right food to eat.
*  Right.
*  Before I would sit there when I'm cutting weight myself.
*  I was like, I'm not going to have breakfast.
*  I'm just going to go to the gym and train.
*  Now I'm waking up and he's giving me like potatoes and eggs.
*  And I'm like, bro, I can't have carbs.
*  What are you giving me these for?
*  Bro, you're not going to train.
*  You're not going to have a good workout
*  unless you had this stuff.
*  So like, there's no thought process with me.
*  He just gives me everything, my shakes, my food.
*  And then I come home from practice
*  and then he has lunch on the table.
*  Then I come home after another session
*  and he has dinner on the table.
*  Is he calculating the calories for each meal
*  and how it's set up?
*  That's where it gets fascinating, right?
*  When they calculate the calories for each meal
*  and they give you the exact right amount.
*  Yeah.
*  I hate looking at the scale.
*  So like he'll make me step on the scale
*  and it'd be five weeks.
*  I'm like, bro, no, we're not.
*  We still have like five more weeks.
*  He's like, get on the scale.
*  So I won't look at it.
*  So he'll look at it right in his phone.
*  And then he'll just keep tracking it the whole time.
*  That's an eating disorder.
*  It is.
*  Yeah, man.
*  You won't even look at it.
*  I was like, bro, I don't even want to look at it.
*  Cause then it just, it tells me like,
*  oh man, I got to do this or I got to do that more.
*  But it'll make me push that much harder at practice.
*  But I'm like, I'm going to push hard anyway for the fight.
*  But I think mentally I just hate scales.
*  I won't step on a scale until I have a fight.
*  Like,
*  Yo, nobody's got an eating disorder like Patty.
*  Oh my God.
*  Patty celebrates his eating disorder.
*  That motherfucker gained 40 pounds after his last fight.
*  And that's going to literally kill him.
*  I feel like it's wild.
*  It's not good.
*  It's definitely, well, he's so good though, man.
*  I'm so impressed with him.
*  Like he keeps getting,
*  I thought Jared Gordon beat him.
*  And I thought that fight to me was,
*  that was another one of those fights.
*  If Jared Gordon wins,
*  then also Jared Gordon's get another big fight,
*  another big fight.
*  And he had two blunders in a row, you know,
*  not his fault.
*  The other one was the headbutt with Bobby.
*  Yeah.
*  But the Patty one was a big one, man,
*  because the Patty one,
*  he was fucking winning that fight, man.
*  I felt that he was landing the big shots.
*  That counter left hook was sweet.
*  He looked good.
*  I thought he won the fight.
*  I thought it was a good fight,
*  but I thought he won the fight.
*  And then Patty fights Bobby Green
*  and he looks like a world beater.
*  He looks like a world beater.
*  That fucking, the strategy was perfect.
*  Stay on the outside, fuck his legs up.
*  And then you realize how big Patty is too.
*  Like Patty's a big 50 fiber,
*  cause Bobby's big.
*  Yeah.
*  Excuse me, King.
*  King now.
*  That's wild.
*  Change his name to King.
*  I love that dude.
*  Change his name to King.
*  So King is, you know,
*  he's a tall dude too for the division.
*  But you realize how big Patty is
*  and people think of Patty only as a grappler,
*  but his kicks were on point, man.
*  His kicks were on point.
*  And he's tough in general.
*  Those guys, when you hit a guy
*  and he's still standing in front of you,
*  it makes you want to shoot on him.
*  Cause I'm looking at Bobby like,
*  why would you shoot a take down on Patty?
*  I felt like this is the only way of beating you
*  is to catch you in a submission.
*  I think his legs were getting fucked up.
*  Yeah.
*  But it just makes you uncomfortable.
*  So he's shot.
*  Here it is.
*  Yeah. I think he was seeing where this was going.
*  Look how big he looks, man.
*  You realize like, damn, he's a big 55er
*  and he caught him with that inside low kick.
*  I mean, it might've been just instinct
*  where Bobby just felt like you had to catch,
*  excuse me, King felt like you had to catch that kick
*  cause it was available, but as a trap.
*  The crowd in Manchester,
*  when Patty walks out, it's like nuts.
*  Yeah. He's a star.
*  Yeah. Over there, it's crazy.
*  When I was sitting in the back,
*  we were sitting in the back warming up
*  and then we just hear the people going nuts.
*  And my family's like texting me like,
*  man, I wish you weren't fighting
*  so I could just enjoy this right now.
*  Lots of Patty walk out.
*  He's a scouser.
*  He's just fun.
*  He looks like he's having a good old time
*  when he's out there and he can back it up.
*  So that fight was big for him
*  because that fight moves him into elite status, right?
*  It goes from Jared Gordon and now, you know,
*  couple of other fights now, bam, Bobby Green,
*  bam, someone's going to be a big name.
*  Someone that's going to be a big game.
*  So he's thinking right now about Islam.
*  He's thinking about those guys at the top of the heap.
*  He's at the point where I think one more,
*  especially because of his name,
*  if he gets like a hooker or a Chandler
*  and he gets past one of them guys,
*  I see them giving a title shot.
*  Don't you think considering the amount of growth
*  that we've already seen from him though,
*  like if you were in his corner,
*  wouldn't you say, couple more would be good?
*  Couple more, couple more, don't rush.
*  I would, but like for money wise,
*  and I think he's about the big name,
*  especially if the UFC,
*  when you're thinking of lightweight,
*  Olivera just lost, Gagey just lost,
*  hooker already lost to Islam.
*  If Islam gets past Armand,
*  I mean if McGregor comes back and he beats Chandler,
*  he's there, but like there's not a lot of names right now
*  for Islam because Gamrott was supposed to be the backup
*  and he just lost to Hooker.
*  But Islam walked through Hooker.
*  So you're like, who is Islam going to fight after Armand?
*  Right, right.
*  It's a good question, good question.
*  Because Gamrott was an interesting one.
*  We were looking forward to that versus Islam.
*  Like that could be interesting
*  because he's such a good grappler.
*  But when people forget about Dan Hooker,
*  they forgot about him too.
*  He's a dog.
*  Dan Hooker went blow for blow with Dustin Poirier.
*  That was as close a fight as you're gonna get.
*  And again, another change of the career, right?
*  Dustin moves on from that, gets the corner fights.
*  Dustin becomes the man.
*  Yeah, people forget about that fight.
*  That was a fucking very close fight, a very good fight.
*  And there was some moments where Dan Hooker
*  was tuning Dustin Poirier up.
*  There's a video compilation online
*  of Hooker having Poirier against the ropes.
*  He's like, rap, rap, rap, rap, rap, rap.
*  He's ripping shots before the end of the round.
*  He's a bad motherfucker.
*  He's like, I fought with a broken arm.
*  He got his arm broken.
*  Didn't say a shit.
*  Didn't say a goddamn word about it.
*  Wins the fight.
*  And they're like, what happened here?
*  I was like, it's just a scratch.
*  He's wild.
*  Even in this fight, his face was like bleeding
*  in between rounds.
*  And he's like, I love this stuff.
*  Well, he also loves, he had that devastating knockout
*  loss to Chandler.
*  Chandler comes out, catches him with that leaping hook,
*  and drops him, and just puts it on him, and like, fuck.
*  This is a big high profile fight, and he got caught.
*  And anybody can get caught.
*  That's what's crazy about the sport.
*  That's why it's so exciting.
*  Anybody can get caught.
*  But it's like, how can you bounce back?
*  Can you bounce back and be the same guy after you got caught?
*  Yeah, and that's the hardest part too,
*  because you get caught, and you don't really feel anything
*  afterwards.
*  It's not like you went through a war or injury,
*  so you want to hop right back into it.
*  You're like, let me get that up, taste it in my mouth.
*  Let me fight again.
*  But you need the coaches around you.
*  I tell you, you still got a concussion.
*  Chill out.
*  Don't fight.
*  Take a couple months off.
*  Gates is taking a year off.
*  And it's like, you need those guys to hold you back,
*  because I've been knocked out before, and it's like,
*  I'm all right, I feel good.
*  My body feels good.
*  I don't have no scratches or anything.
*  I didn't go through a 15 minute war.
*  So I'm like, let me get another fight.
*  Let me get another fight.
*  But you don't know what's going on in your brain.
*  You don't know what your brain's dealing with.
*  And that's going to be your future right there.
*  Yep, exactly.
*  And so many fighters, they're so tough.
*  They feel fine.
*  Their mind is, their determination is strong.
*  I want to get back in there.
*  That was the case with Jamal Hill.
*  He was going to get right back in after the pejada fight,
*  and he was going to fight Roundtree, which is,
*  woo, that's a bad fight if you just got knocked out
*  just a few months ago.
*  That's a scary dude.
*  And even taking that pejada fight,
*  he had a torn Achilles,
*  and I think he just got cleared
*  to come back from that Achilles.
*  And it's like, right now you got to fight Alex
*  in six weeks.
*  And I'm like, bro, that's a short camp,
*  and you're switching up right away,
*  but he's like, 300, it's such a big opportunity.
*  You can't say no to that.
*  And then, yeah, you get knocked out by pejada,
*  and you're like, all right, I want to get right back in there.
*  But you're right back in there.
*  It's going to be against a monster-like Roundtree.
*  I know, I know.
*  Not an easy fight.
*  It was funny because he was on your show,
*  and I'm like listening to him, and he's like,
*  I may do a Jiu-Jitsu tournament.
*  And then I'm like, a week later, he gets a title fight.
*  Yeah, I know.
*  You're telling him the whole time, no.
*  No.
*  No fucking way, don't do that.
*  You do all that shit when it's over.
*  Because I remember, Cubs Swanson did a Jiu-Jitsu tournament,
*  tore his ACL.
*  Yeah, once you tear some shit, doing something stupid,
*  and you miss a title shot,
*  you're never going to forgive yourself.
*  Yeah.
*  Especially Khalil's like 35.
*  He's up in that age range, too,
*  where it's like, now's the time, man.
*  So it was perfect timing.
*  And a lot of people like Ankalayev
*  should have got the title shot,
*  but the problem is they already set up that fight
*  with Racketsch, which doesn't really totally make sense.
*  Right?
*  Right?
*  If you think, has Racketsch fought since Yuri beat him up?
*  No.
*  Okay, so that kind of doesn't make sense a little bit.
*  Yeah.
*  It'd make more sense if Jamal fought Racketsch, right?
*  Jamal, but Jamal wants something a little more high profile.
*  I understand that, but Ankalayev, man,
*  no one's beaten him.
*  Ankalayev had that one draw with Jan Behovic,
*  and no one's beaten him.
*  Yeah.
*  And here's another guy everybody forgets about,
*  Jan Behovic.
*  What the fuck?
*  That guy almost beat Paheta.
*  He was right, that was such a close fight.
*  Super close.
*  Yeah.
*  Down with the wire.
*  Everybody's like, yeah, we already saw that.
*  Like, what?
*  What?
*  You gotta give Jan his deal.
*  He was a light heavyweight champion of the fucking world,
*  and a destroyer.
*  Yeah.
*  For whatever reason.
*  I think they look at that number.
*  They say, oh, he's 40 years old.
*  Yeah.
*  He's 41 years old, whatever he is now.
*  So what?
*  So what?
*  He still fucked up Dominik Reyes,
*  he still fucks up everybody.
*  Jan Behovic is a murderer.
*  Yeah.
*  He's a scary dude, man.
*  That's a good fight.
*  And he's Polish, bro.
*  Yeah.
*  They don't age.
*  He's a killer.
*  That dude's made out of rocks.
*  I remember when Ankalayev and him were going
*  leg kick to leg kick, you know,
*  he was kicking his shins and fucking Ankalayev's legs up.
*  I'm like, this guy is nuts, and I'm like,
*  so I went to my coach, and I'm like,
*  what kind of low kick was he doing?
*  He was like, I think he was just going shin to shin.
*  He was.
*  Like, I'm not gonna teach that.
*  He was just saying, feel Polish bone density.
*  Slamming those fucking shins into the shins.
*  But if I'm ahead, I'm gonna pick all the strikers.
*  Like, Hemingroun Tree's gonna be a crazy one.
*  This is the only loss against Paul Craig,
*  his first fight in the UFC.
*  Oh yeah, Ankalayev got caught in a triangle, that's right.
*  Last second of the third fight.
*  Yeah, last second of the fight where he was,
*  Paul Craig has the nastiest triangle in the division,
*  for sure, one of the nastiest triangles in the sport.
*  Look at this, look how quick he snatches that shit up.
*  Boom, snap, and too late.
*  So here we got, I think there was like five seconds to go
*  when he locks this up.
*  And he tapped.
*  Unbelievable, man.
*  That is wild.
*  So Ankalayev's had this long ass win streak.
*  He looked real good in his last fight.
*  And then they give him a guy who,
*  so he beat Johnny Walker twice.
*  One of them, Johnny Walker, it was like a,
*  there was an injury, right?
*  Oh, the desert.
*  What happened?
*  He was in Abu Dhabi and he got a knee while he was down.
*  And then the doctor came in and he said, who are you?
*  And he said desert, and the doctor stopped it.
*  Oh, that's right.
*  And he got mad, like, why are you stopping it?
*  That's right, that's right.
*  But so here's the draw with Jan Blachowicz.
*  He KO's Anthony Smith, beats Tiago Sanchez,
*  beats Volkan, beats all these guys.
*  I mean, he's beaten a lot of guys.
*  I mean, he's got a really good skill set
*  where you would think about with a guy like Paeda,
*  because he can wrestle.
*  He can strike and he can wrestle.
*  And he has a huge knockout against Johnny Walker last,
*  so that's.
*  Yeah, so I guess for him, he fights Rockich.
*  I favor him in that fight,
*  but Rockich is fucking dangerous as shit, man.
*  You know, Rockich has had a long time
*  off of the Prohaska fight,
*  and Rockich looked real good in that fight.
*  He was eating Yuri up before,
*  but Yuri was just walking through everything.
*  Yuri's like the new age Tony Ferguson,
*  where you hit me, I'm gonna hit you with five other punches,
*  and it's gonna make you tired of just hitting me,
*  and I'm gonna catch you.
*  It just doesn't work with Politan.
*  Yeah.
*  You can't be getting hit by that guy.
*  I wanna feel his low kick,
*  just because I'm like, bro, what does he do?
*  He just touches,
*  I feel like he just touches you with his foot,
*  and it's just like, you can't walk afterward.
*  He's targeting it too.
*  He doesn't ever go shin to shin,
*  and even when he checks, he doesn't go shin to shin.
*  He lifts his leg up like he's playing hacky sack.
*  He just lifts his leg up.
*  He just goes ankle, he just lifts his ankle
*  so his foot comes all the way up to his other knee,
*  and then he drops it back down,
*  and then he comes in with the right hand.
*  Like he's got it down,
*  where if you try to ankle kick him,
*  he's got so many counters for that calf kick.
*  And he feels like he's on every pay-per-view now.
*  Yeah, man.
*  Like they just, hey, we need somebody.
*  They put the bat symbol out there,
*  and he's like, all right, I'm ready.
*  He'll fight anybody.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, he's fighting in Salt Lake City against Roundtree,
*  and that's a wild ass fight, man.
*  That's a wild fight.
*  A lot of people say, oh, Roundtree doesn't deserve it.
*  Let me tell you something.
*  Roundtree fights like you just killed his family
*  and lit his house on fire.
*  That dude's coming for you.
*  Yeah.
*  He's coming for everybody.
*  And stylistically, it's just.
*  Yeah.
*  He's not gonna shoot a takedown.
*  Yeah.
*  There'll be no takedowns.
*  He's fucking dangerous, man.
*  But if you think about the,
*  like, Paheta's striking,
*  like, his overall accomplishments are second to none
*  in MMA, two division glory world champion.
*  I mean, and the thing about him is
*  that fucking power is just freakish.
*  And he just, like, touches it, though.
*  It feels like, bro, what is that?
*  You see him hit the power cube,
*  and he got 191 on the power cube with a right hand,
*  and that's not even his left hook.
*  Like, hit it, he probably doesn't want anybody to know.
*  Yeah.
*  Hit it with the left hook.
*  That's the sleeper.
*  That left hook is the sleeper.
*  It'd be like 5,000.
*  You're like. Bro.
*  It's crazy, he just touches people.
*  And it's, when you're starting to see his personality
*  come out now, Morris, it's so fun,
*  because Glover's like the nicest guy in the world.
*  And at first, Alex was, like, so quiet,
*  and now you're starting to see Glover pull it out of him.
*  Even when he wins, he's never like, yeah!
*  And so he's like, yep.
*  Another day. Yep, another day.
*  Another day, another dude I put to sleep.
*  Like, even after he beat Izzy,
*  he just walked away from him.
*  The referee stopped the fight, and he just walked away.
*  But there's something exciting about that, too.
*  Like, that guy's one of the biggest pay-per-view stars
*  in the country, in the world,
*  and most people don't even understand what he's saying.
*  And he's a star, right? He's a huge star.
*  All he has to do is make facial expressions.
*  But also, it's scary.
*  When he comes out with the bow and arrow,
*  boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
*  Ah!
*  Like, it's fucking, you're like,
*  if you're sitting there watching that guy walk to the cage,
*  you're like, ah, shit!
*  I mean, like, thinking to myself,
*  I gotta come up with some sort of stick like that.
*  Like, I gotta figure out something.
*  But I can't think of anything.
*  Nah, you gotta think for yourself.
*  Yeah, you gotta be yourself.
*  That's either you or that's not you.
*  But that's the coolest thing in the world.
*  Whenever I'm in one of his fights, to see that walkout.
*  Yeah, look at that face, dude.
*  And the music.
*  That is the most terrifying face.
*  Him walking towards the cage, you're standing there,
*  you've been prepping for this dude for 12 weeks,
*  and you're like, oh, Jesus, here it comes.
*  Damn.
*  Bro, I hate seeing that one, just because Jamal's my boy,
*  and I'm like, I like, obviously, I'm a fan of Hanna,
*  but man, to see him just like, catch my boy,
*  I'm like, ah, come on, Jamal, give one back,
*  just to get that taste out of our mouth.
*  Well, there was a weird moment in that fight,
*  and we've talked about it before,
*  where Jamal accidentally low kicked him,
*  and the referee moves in to stop him,
*  and he's like, oh, I'm gonna go for the low kick.
*  And Jamal's like, oh, I'm gonna go for the low kick.
*  And Jamal's like, oh, I'm gonna go for the low kick.
*  And the referee moves in to stop,
*  and Jamal stands up straight and relaxes, like, you okay?
*  And when Poetan puts his hand on Herb Dean, he advances.
*  He makes a little hop step,
*  and then he goes right back to fighting,
*  and then he catches him with the left hook.
*  So he closed some distance.
*  And it's a game of inches.
*  Oh, especially with that guy.
*  Yeah, especially with that guy.
*  He does everything for a reason,
*  and then when you see somebody break it down like that,
*  like you said, everything changes.
*  Imagine if he didn't.
*  Imagine the refs that are like,
*  you back up, you back up.
*  Yep, yep, everything changes.
*  Yeah.
*  But that's moments and fights, you know?
*  And maybe that will define Jamal's career.
*  Maybe Jamal will learn from that
*  and never take his eye off the prize again.
*  Yeah.
*  Never relax.
*  And I guarantee you he won't relax now.
*  Yeah.
*  Protect yourself at all times.
*  And I guess, you know,
*  I see it from Poetan's point of view too.
*  The referee said, okay, keep going, and he caught him.
*  But he did close that distance because of that low kick.
*  So it is a moment.
*  And I think it opened up a lot of fighters' eyes too, right?
*  You're starting to see these little things.
*  For me now, I'm like, no, the ref tells me something.
*  I'm either taking one step back myself
*  or I'm gonna take that step forward
*  and catch that ahead of distance myself.
*  You just can't relax.
*  You can never relax.
*  Because it's such a game of impossible things
*  happening at any moment.
*  Because so many guys have pulled out impossible things.
*  Head kicks, spinning elbows out of nowhere.
*  You know, things happen.
*  And if you're relaxed even for a second.
*  Yeah, the Korean zombie, Yair.
*  Oh my God.
*  Uppercut elbow.
*  Oh my God.
*  What was this?
*  Running away, uppercut elbow.
*  With like two seconds left.
*  Crazy.
*  How?
*  How did this just happen right now?
*  When Yair landed that jumping roundhouse kick
*  on Andre Feely.
*  Oh.
*  Ooh, the scissor kick.
*  Wow.
*  My God.
*  His kicks are so nasty.
*  Yeah, it's so interesting to see all these different ways
*  to get elite.
*  There's so many different ways.
*  Some guys are specialists like Paheta.
*  And some guys just dominate all aspects like Islam.
*  There's all these different ways that guys achieve
*  to becoming the best.
*  Yeah, that's my mindset.
*  I always tell myself I'm behind.
*  Because I started late so I'm like,
*  I didn't do martial arts since I was a kid.
*  So I always gotta tell myself,
*  oh, we gotta do everything.
*  There's not one thing that I'm amazing at.
*  But people see the fight and they're like,
*  oh, all you are is a wrestler.
*  Or all you are is this and that.
*  And I'm just like, bro, I do everything.
*  And I train everything more than everybody else.
*  And I don't take any days off.
*  How old were you when you first started training?
*  I was 23.
*  Wow.
*  That's crazy.
*  That's way behind the curve.
*  Way behind.
*  Way behind.
*  And I did like two years of high school wrestling.
*  Wow.
*  At least you had that.
*  That's definitely something.
*  Oh no, I mean, for me it changed my life.
*  Because you're in high school, your body's developing.
*  Your body's developing,
*  where you learn how to take people down.
*  That helps for sure.
*  But if nothing by 23 is crazy.
*  I always played sports in general.
*  No striking at all?
*  Nothing?
*  No, I mean, I would always get in like street fights
*  in like Chicago, just cause I'm a trash talker
*  when I play basketball.
*  So like we would always sit there and go to the park
*  and then people would see like,
*  who are these A-Raps coming to play basketball?
*  We'll be winning and I'm talking trash.
*  And then it'd be like,
*  they want to start a fight afterward.
*  So it was always the best.
*  What made you start training?
*  My high school wrestling coach, Louis Taylor,
*  he was like the PFL middleweight champion.
*  He was in my high school wrestling coach for two years.
*  And then he like left.
*  And so I'm like, whatever happens to him.
*  He was like that cool coach, that young coach.
*  And he was like gone.
*  So I stopped wrestling.
*  And then I was at school for just,
*  I was trying to be like a lawyer.
*  And I ended up seeing him in a newspaper.
*  He was fighting in StrikeForce.
*  So then I just like messaged him on Facebook.
*  And I was like, bro, you're a fighter?
*  And he's like, yeah.
*  I was like, whatever happens to you?
*  He's like, I was still young.
*  I still had something left in me.
*  So I wanted to start training.
*  And he used to be like Rampage's roommate in college.
*  So he had already had like that mindset of like,
*  oh, these guys are fighting.
*  I can fight too.
*  So then his gym ended up being probably like
*  10 minutes away from my mom's house.
*  So when I come home from school on the weekends,
*  I'll just start training with him.
*  And then it was just like a snowball effect.
*  I started like falling in love with it.
*  And after my first amateur fight,
*  after like two months, I was like,
*  can I get a fight?
*  And he's like, yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Cause I was just like excited about the whole thing.
*  And for us two, it was like,
*  we were only training partners.
*  So I'm training with him.
*  And like, I'm learning the hard way.
*  Like we're just going straight sparring
*  or straight wrestling.
*  And he was like a division one wrestler.
*  He had crazy power, crazy jiu-jitsu.
*  So like, I'm getting good just because
*  he's beating me up the whole time.
*  So then I'm like, oh, I can fight amateur.
*  And he's like, yeah, let's go get you one.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  So then I got it.
*  It was like the biggest street fight in the world.
*  The amateur fight.
*  It was like nothing good about it,
*  my technique or anything.
*  But it's funny cause Mark Coleman
*  was a commentator for it.
*  Oh, wow.
*  Yeah.
*  It was like the whole scenario was crazy.
*  And it was like, I got a bar and it was just like, cool.
*  So then after that, I was like, bro, all right.
*  I transferred to like a closer school near the gym.
*  I started training more with him.
*  And then, you know, my parents are telling me like,
*  stay in school, stay in school.
*  So then once I started just like getting more wins,
*  more wins, and I decided to go pro, I said,
*  I'll go back to school after I lose.
*  And then we just kept going until we got to the UFC.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah. It was wild.
*  He's still with me now to this day, but even with him,
*  he was 41 years old and they never gave him a UFC shot,
*  but he ended up going to PFL and he was like a 1200 underdog
*  and he won the million dollars at 30 seconds
*  with a knockout.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah. He was fighting a, a, a boost.
*  Nigel Maddow, the one that's in the UFC now,
*  they were in the finals.
*  The first-
*  He beat a boost?
*  He beat a boost, 30 second knockout.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  A boost is good.
*  Yeah. And he was 41 years old, never got his shot.
*  And it's crazy how his career ended like that.
*  Middleweight champion, retired on top now, million dollars.
*  And there's a lot of guys that go to the UFC
*  that don't hit a million dollars.
*  That's true.
*  So he's like, my path was that way.
*  So even with me, when I was doing all this,
*  I was waiting for this title fight.
*  He was like, patience, it's going to come.
*  Like you saw what I had to go through.
*  Your title fight is going to come.
*  It's going to come at the right moment.
*  So just enjoy the journey.
*  Can you find that fight?
*  See if you can find that fight, Jamie.
*  Louis Taylor.
*  And a boost, Magomedov.
*  A boost had a great first round with Sean Strickland.
*  A great first round.
*  But that was like, Sean Strickland is just a zombie.
*  He just marches towards you and you can't hit him.
*  He's hard to hit, but he was fucking his legs up.
*  I was hoping a boost would knock him out.
*  I was like, come on a boost, please.
*  Bro, he was putting an autumn in that first round,
*  but he started getting tired.
*  By the end of the first round, he was tired.
*  He threw everything at him.
*  Yeah.
*  Everything was full clip too.
*  Full speed, full clip.
*  And I was like, cause even at PFL,
*  the way he was killing everybody, he was like.
*  So he was 41 in this fight?
*  Yeah.
*  That's so crazy.
*  So this is the PFL championships in 2018.
*  Yeah.
*  And it's crazy cause they got rid of the middleweight
*  division after this.
*  So now they don't have middleweight there anymore.
*  How is that possible?
*  Cause they wanted to put the women's division,
*  the 55ers.
*  So they got rid of the middleweight guys.
*  Can I talk to somebody over there?
*  Alex.
*  A boost.
*  See, there's a low kick.
*  His low kicks are nasty.
*  He just, for whatever reason,
*  a boost has a hard time sustaining it.
*  I mean, I think he's getting better in the UFC.
*  And I think the Sean Strickland fight was just too quick.
*  Oh, left hook.
*  Oh my goodness.
*  Oh my goodness.
*  Back that up again.
*  Look at this.
*  They go shin, shin, boom.
*  Oh my God.
*  The distance he covered with that left hook.
*  And it's like a boost is even blocking it too.
*  Like, he just has crazy power.
*  There's one thing about guys who are really good at shooting.
*  That same ability to cover distance
*  when you make a double leg
*  is the same kind of drive that you need
*  to move forward to punch.
*  That's one of the reasons why Randleman was so dangerous.
*  Yeah.
*  Cause Randleman had that crazy shot.
*  So he could explode forward and punch you from a distance.
*  You really can't punch him.
*  That's incredible.
*  Look how much distance he covers.
*  Jamie just broke it down.
*  Look at this.
*  Yeah, he hopped in there.
*  Now go back a little bit further, please.
*  Just a little bit further before he throws the punch.
*  He's way back there, dude.
*  Watch this.
*  Look how far away he is.
*  Oh my goodness.
*  Abuse made a mistake that he tried to counter.
*  He was thinking about countering before the punch got to him,
*  and he just wasn't quick enough.
*  That's incredible.
*  Good for him, man.
*  Yeah.
*  Good for him.
*  And that guy's legit, man.
*  To knock out a guy like that, Abuse is legit.
*  Yeah.
*  When people go back and look at his record,
*  he had like 10 first round finishes on his come up.
*  But the UFC just said he was too old.
*  They never gave him a shot.
*  Oh, that's crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  And I was like, bro, people just saw him.
*  And even when he started his career, like I said,
*  I was one of his main training partners from the beginning.
*  If he was like an American top team or a real gym,
*  because he had kids early, so he didn't want to leave them.
*  So he always trained in Chicago.
*  And he's like, I'm going to build up my own guys.
*  So we had a small gym, like three or four guys,
*  that he just used as the main training partners.
*  And he became the main champion.
*  There's some dudes that can compete at a world class level
*  deep into their 40s.
*  And I always point to Bernard Hopkins.
*  Everybody wrote Bernard Hopkins off
*  before he fought Kelly Pavlik.
*  And he beat the shit out of Kelly Pavlik.
*  And he just boxed him.
*  He just did everything perfect.
*  It was a master class in boxing, a master class
*  in world championship caliber boxing
*  against a guy in Kelly Pavlik, which is fucking dangerous,
*  man. Wicked puncher, tough as shit.
*  That Jermaine Taylor fight was crazy.
*  He was out in that fight and came back to stop Taylor.
*  Just a warrior, a real dog.
*  So Bernard was like, how old was Bernard
*  when he fought Kelly Pavlik?
*  When he fought Felix Trinidad, everybody wrote him off.
*  He was like 36 or something by the time he fought Trinidad.
*  Yeah, man. Everybody wrote him off.
*  Wow.
*  Bernard was wild too.
*  He threw the Puerto Rican flag down on the ground
*  in Puerto Rico and he had to run.
*  People were chasing him.
*  He ran? He had to run.
*  They were trying to kill him.
*  Yeah, you can't do that.
*  Yeah, he told me the whole story. It was hilarious.
*  Yeah, he's a, I mean, but how old was Bernard?
*  43 years old when he fought Kelly Pavlik.
*  Come on, son. 43 years old.
*  That's so crazy.
*  He beat Roy Jones Jr. when he was 45.
*  Unbelievable. Unbelievable.
*  Oh wow, that's wild.
*  The Chad Dawson fight, bro.
*  He was 46 years old and Chad Dawson was a killer.
*  Chad Dawson was a vicious knockout artist
*  and he knocked him out in the second round.
*  And then he lost against him in the next fight.
*  That's how good Chad was.
*  Chad was a fucking good fighter.
*  Then he lost to Kovalev and he lost to Joe Smith Jr.,
*  which was a bad one.
*  But he was 51 years old when he fought Joe Smith.
*  And Joe Smith is another one who's a fucking killer, man.
*  He's a dangerous puncher.
*  Joe Smith is a mauler, dangerous guy.
*  51 years old?
*  That's wild. Natural?
*  51 years old?
*  What do you think of Tyson and Jake?
*  I wish he didn't do it.
*  I wish it wasn't a thing.
*  I wish it wasn't a thing where a 58 year old guy
*  was gonna fight a 28 year old.
*  That said, that out the window.
*  I fully support his desire to do it.
*  What, is he gonna live forever?
*  He's not gonna live forever.
*  Maybe he wants one more shot at it.
*  Maybe his body can do one more fight.
*  I don't know.
*  He looks great on the mitts,
*  but that doesn't mean that you know as much as I know.
*  I could look good on the mitts.
*  Yeah.
*  I tell people that, bro, mitts doesn't show anything.
*  Especially if you're watching 30 second clips,
*  what you wanna see is him sparring.
*  You wanna see him hitting the bag for multiple rounds.
*  You'd wanna see, let's see three rounds hard on the bag.
*  I'm gonna see what you could do.
*  I wanna see how your feet move.
*  I wanna see what it looks like if you're off balance
*  when you throw in combinations.
*  You look like Tyson.
*  Yeah.
*  Remember, there's some videos of Tyson hitting the bag
*  when he was like 19 years old.
*  And it's like,
*  it's crazy.
*  You watch like the speed and the power.
*  See if you can find that.
*  Mike Tyson hitting the heavy bag when he's young.
*  Terrifying, terrifying.
*  That to me, a bag is different than mitts.
*  Mitts guys are meeting you halfway.
*  You know, you've got a combination worked out.
*  Okay, I want you to go left, right, left of the body,
*  right over hand.
*  Pop, pop, pop, pop.
*  Okay, do it again.
*  Pop, pop, pop, pop.
*  It kinda can look real good.
*  Yeah.
*  But can you do that with a guy who's moving?
*  Can you spar?
*  Would they bring in a world-class heavyweight?
*  Can you do that?
*  How do you move?
*  How are your knees?
*  How's your back?
*  Can you sustain that?
*  Can you sustain those kind of explosions?
*  Or is this just a gimmick?
*  I don't know.
*  I know he used to be able to, but we won't really know.
*  So here's him when he's young.
*  Michael Tyson.
*  Yeah, kill the sound.
*  You don't have to see the sound.
*  Just look at this.
*  And he's young here, man, young.
*  So that's him hitting the bag later in life.
*  I would wanna see rounds, you know?
*  I wanna see rounds.
*  I wanna see what it looks like when he's tired.
*  How quick does he get tired?
*  I wanna see him sparring.
*  I wonder if he's gonna spar.
*  Look at that when he's young, man.
*  Dude, terrifying.
*  Those combinations when he's, show that again.
*  Bro, he was so fast.
*  So fast and always moving, always moving.
*  Bobbing and weaving.
*  He was a target that you couldn't find.
*  Just moving at you, constantly advancing.
*  It's just a mindset, like just craziness.
*  Madness, just controlled madness in there
*  with perfect technique and ferocious power
*  and awesome genetics.
*  You know, they said that,
*  Teddy Atlas told me that when he was 13 years old,
*  he would bring him to Smokers and they would go,
*  how old's that kid?
*  He was 13.
*  He's 16.
*  He's like, fine, he's 16.
*  And he was 190 at 13 years old.
*  What?
*  Yeah, 190.
*  Wow. 190.
*  That's wild.
*  What?
*  That's God.
*  He got a gift.
*  He got a, God kissed his physique.
*  As you're at a smoke, you're a 13 year old
*  and you see that guy.
*  What the fuck?
*  Oh, you gotta fight him.
*  You're like, what the fuck?
*  What are you talking about?
*  That's a man.
*  I'm gonna pull guard.
*  That's a box it.
*  Fuck this.
*  And he scared a lot of guys before they even
*  threw their first punch.
*  You would see the look, like I remember Bruce Seldin,
*  he missed a left hook of Bruce Seldin
*  and Bruce Seldin went down.
*  He's like, fuck all this.
*  Fuck all this.
*  Fuck all this.
*  Yeah, what do you wanna miss?
*  Yeah, but he's 58.
*  I support him.
*  I love that guy.
*  I fully support.
*  I'm a gigantic fan of his.
*  Me meeting him the first time I met him at the UFC,
*  there's some starstruck moments where you meet people
*  and be like, oh shit, that's Sugar Ray Leonard.
*  Oh shit, that's Mike Tyson.
*  I was one of the most starstruck moments I ever had.
*  Couldn't believe I was meeting Mike Tyson.
*  When I did a podcast with him, I was like,
*  I can't believe I'm talking to Mike Tyson.
*  It just seemed, he was such a huge part of my childhood.
*  When I was a kid was when he was coming up.
*  I have in my office framed the cover of Sports Illustrated
*  when he was 19.
*  Wow, really?
*  Yeah, it says Kid Dynamite.
*  See if you can find that.
*  You had it from back then?
*  Oh, no, no, no, someone gave it to me recently.
*  Might have been Sports Illustrated sent it to me.
*  I don't know who sent it to me.
*  Do you know who sent it?
*  Somebody sent it to me.
*  Thank you, whoever did it.
*  I forgot, I'm sorry.
*  But that's the cover.
*  That's framed in my office.
*  At 19 years old on the cover of Sports.
*  I think that was 1985.
*  Is that what year that was?
*  Does it say what year that was?
*  See if you can find it.
*  What does it say, 86?
*  So that was right before he won the title.
*  He won the title when he was 20.
*  So I was just out of high school and he was the guy.
*  Heavyweight boxing had gotten boring.
*  Nobody cared.
*  After Larry Holmes, people were bored with heavyweight boxing.
*  There was a bunch of champions and nobody heard of.
*  It was like they weren't really interested.
*  No disrespect to any of those guys,
*  but they didn't excite the public the way Muhammad Ali did,
*  the way George Foreman did.
*  Heavyweight boxing was kind of dead.
*  And then all of a sudden this dude comes along.
*  You're like, oh my God.
*  He was doing everything he wanted a heavyweight to do,
*  just starching people, just sending them flying.
*  He'd hit them with left hooks, they'd go flying.
*  He's like, look at this guy.
*  He's gonna become the youngest heavyweight champion
*  of all time.
*  And then he fights Trevor Burbick and knocks him out quick.
*  How much were pay-per-views back then?
*  I don't remember.
*  But I remember a lot of times people
*  wouldn't wanna buy Mike Tyson pay-per-views
*  because they knew the fights would be over so quick.
*  Yeah.
*  It was nuts, man.
*  So this is, is this a documentary?
*  It says Kid Dynamite, 1985.
*  Oh, so this is him in 1985.
*  Yeah, this is him when people were just starting
*  to hear about him.
*  And he came through the ranks quick.
*  Just was fucking everybody up.
*  He was having a hard time getting fights.
*  And everybody thought this is the guy.
*  This is the next destroyer.
*  I mean, he was just killing people, man.
*  Everybody he fought was getting fucked up.
*  Oh my.
*  Just the head movement and the inside is just wild.
*  Everything.
*  And the power.
*  It was just, that's what you wanted to see
*  from a heavyweight.
*  So that guy is still alive.
*  And he still remembers all these moments.
*  It's not like he doesn't know how to put his knuckles
*  on your face.
*  The question is, how much does he have left in his body?
*  58 today is not 58 when I was 21.
*  It's a different 58, especially if they're not testing him.
*  Okay, if they're letting him take hormones
*  and do all the things that I would recommend 100%.
*  I mean, I don't know how you could do it if you're 58
*  if you're not doing that.
*  If they're allowing him to do all that stuff
*  and get his body to the optimum level
*  that's known to science.
*  You're dealing with a different kind of human being.
*  You're dealing with one of the greatest fighters
*  that's ever lived.
*  It's just how much does he wanna do it?
*  Is he doing it for money?
*  How much does he have left in the tank?
*  Those are all questions that'll make me buy the pay-per-view.
*  It's on Netflix though, it's free.
*  Yeah, that's right, it's free.
*  Yeah, I'm gonna watch it.
*  100% I'm gonna watch it.
*  I'm gonna feel bad if he gets knocked out.
*  Yeah.
*  But you know.
*  What are his most recent comments about the fight?
*  Tyson addressed the meeting with his usual boldness
*  during a press conference.
*  The show's readiness for battle.
*  He said, I'm just ready, I'm ready.
*  I'm gonna talk my talk and do my shit,
*  but I'm ready to fight.
*  Is he really a young killer?
*  Tyson said, discounting any questions on his readiness.
*  Reacting to Paul's taunting Tyson's need
*  to postpone the fight because of an ulcer flare-up
*  earlier in the summer.
*  Former champion made a strong statement
*  about his unmatched abilities.
*  He said, I feel a lot better now.
*  Who else can do it but me?
*  Who else is going to fight to make this happen?
*  You got a YouTuber fighting the greatest fighter
*  that ever lived.
*  Ooh.
*  I wanna hear him say that.
*  That sound coming out of his voice would be like.
*  Well, you also have to remember about Mike Tyson.
*  Is that Mike Tyson knows how to mentally prepare.
*  He was trained by Custamato, who was a hypnotist.
*  And Custamato started hypnotizing him
*  when he was 13 years old.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, that was part of the reason
*  why he was so terrifying.
*  His mindset was just unstoppable.
*  He really thought that he could not be stopped.
*  He thought he was gonna murder everybody.
*  And Cust was his hero.
*  Cust raised him.
*  Cust took him in when he was 13 years old.
*  He had this terrible childhood,
*  no love, just in and out of trouble,
*  terrible, bad situation, horrible poverty and crime.
*  And then all of a sudden he's being taken care of
*  by this dude who's a master boxer.
*  Master boxing coach.
*  He trained world champions like Jose Torres
*  and Floyd Patterson.
*  And now he's got this young pupil.
*  This is his last hurrah.
*  And the greatest shot he's ever had
*  having a real all-time great.
*  I mean, this guy's an all-time great and he's 13.
*  Wow, yeah.
*  He's a 13-year-old, 190-pound kid.
*  Like what in the fuck?
*  And he's got this kid and he's hypnotizing him.
*  And he's telling him you're the greatest.
*  And he's getting it into his head.
*  So from the time he was really young,
*  he was learning mental preparation.
*  He was learning how to put himself into a mindset
*  of just an unstoppable juggernaut
*  that had one goal, one task.
*  And Cust would tell him, you don't exist.
*  Only the task exists.
*  Like you don't exist.
*  What you have to do exists.
*  That's what you are.
*  Wow, that's powerful.
*  I'll write that down.
*  Yeah, so the question is how much does that guy have left?
*  Conventional wisdom would say this is a terrible fight.
*  Conventional wisdom would say there's a 28-year-old
*  with knockout power, just knocked out Mike Perry.
*  He's real fast, he's young, he's fucking athletic,
*  he's bold as shit.
*  He's a good boxer.
*  He's a very good boxer.
*  People don't wanna give him his credit
*  because he's a YouTuber and all that shit.
*  Anybody who knocks out Tyron Woodley with one punch
*  can fucking crack.
*  Anybody that can move the way that dude moves
*  and have a fight with Tommy Fury,
*  who's a world-class boxer, and he lost that fight,
*  but it was a very good fight.
*  He's a good fighter, a real good fighter.
*  And he's actually training, like he's getting better.
*  People are just like sleeping on him
*  just because he's a YouTuber.
*  But I'm like, he just beat Mike Perry,
*  who was killing it in the bare-knuckle boxing.
*  He was like on top, but they don't wanna give credit.
*  It would've been interesting to see him fight Mike Perry
*  bare-knuckle though.
*  That changes everything.
*  That changes everything.
*  Mike Perry is the best at that shit.
*  But it's interesting how that's a different sport
*  because it really is a different sport.
*  It's a whole different thing when your hands aren't covered
*  and you feel those bones piercing your skin.
*  It's a mindset too.
*  He's a 100% human pit bull.
*  That's a 100% human pit bull.
*  That guy has no quit in him, no quit.
*  He fucking throws caution to the wind
*  at every possible occasion.
*  You can hit him, he's gonna hit you back.
*  He knows how to take punishment.
*  He likes it, he likes getting hit.
*  He broke Rocko's teeth.
*  Yeah.
*  And I was like.
*  Broke Luke Rocko's teeth.
*  He's way bigger too, Rocko.
*  Well imagine, okay, how about him and MVP?
*  Okay, him and MVP with the gloves on in an MMA fight,
*  you favor MVP, right?
*  Well I favor MVP.
*  MVP is super hard to hit.
*  He's got crazy distance management,
*  those kicks and that distance and the long length.
*  But he decided to take a challenge
*  and fight Mike Perry bare knuckle
*  because he thought, look, I can move better than anybody.
*  I am the most elite mover in all of MMA
*  and I'm gonna fight this flat footed meathead psychopath.
*  And that flat footed meathead psychopath
*  just walked him down.
*  And dropped him a couple times in there.
*  Yeah man, crazy, crazy.
*  It changes everything.
*  Changes everything.
*  And just the scarring, like your knuckles
*  and your faces after that.
*  Your face is getting sliced open.
*  But they're starting to pay these guys.
*  When you see guys like Eddie Alvarez
*  and Chad Menes go over there, you're like,
*  ain't McGregor like a owner part of it now too?
*  But McGregor's grinding me though.
*  After Mike Perry lost it, he said,
*  yeah, I'm cutting it out.
*  Like bro, who just tweeted?
*  I wonder if this guy tweeted for himself.
*  He's tweeting for fun.
*  Apparently Mike Perry has a piece of a bare knuckle too.
*  Oh does he?
*  Yeah, I think that's what he said.
*  He's like, I'm one of the owners too, motherfucker.
*  He's the face of it.
*  I wouldn't even be watching it if Mike Perry was on there.
*  I think regular boxing is just very different.
*  It's very different.
*  What you can get away with.
*  The fact that you can't really clinch
*  and punch the way those guys do.
*  In bare knuckle boxing, those guys are getting grimy.
*  There's a lot of dirty boxing in there.
*  It's just so different when those bare knuckles touch you.
*  Just so different.
*  It's different.
*  You can't guard as much.
*  Your still stuff's getting through.
*  You don't have the big cushions in front of you.
*  Those big cushions mean a lot, man.
*  They stop a lot of shit.
*  It's wild, the differences.
*  Even when we're sparring with big gloves,
*  or sparring with smaller gloves that we have,
*  it's like, it changes everything.
*  Changes everything.
*  Yeah, and then even no padding on your knuckles.
*  You don't even want to throw as hard.
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  And your wrists will break easily.
*  So you have to punch a specific way.
*  I think they all have a different format
*  of the way they punch.
*  They just hold their wrists in a different way
*  like this or something like that.
*  Yeah, like you remember them old timey boxing guys?
*  Yeah.
*  They're punches like this.
*  Those bare knuckle guys, they all fought like this.
*  They jabbed each other like this.
*  They were just trying to only hit with these two knuckles.
*  Yeah, when we were younger we would do that.
*  Like we were going to punch somebody in the knee
*  or something like that.
*  We would put that knuckle out there.
*  Even just think how stupid it was.
*  But I mean, you could use that bare knuckle.
*  Well, you could definitely use it in the eyeball.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, if you punch something like that on purpose
*  to the eyeball.
*  Like that's real.
*  I wonder, has there been eye pokes in,
*  a lot of eye pokes in their fighting?
*  That's a good question.
*  I don't remember any.
*  Yeah, like I haven't really even thought about that,
*  but I don't feel like there has.
*  I think in MMA a lot of them come from this.
*  A lot of them come from that distance management.
*  Yeah.
*  And I think that's, ooh, I think one point every time.
*  Poke someone's eye, one point.
*  And no one will ever do that again.
*  Everybody will keep their hands closed.
*  Yeah.
*  You poke someone with the fingers one time, one point.
*  It should be trained.
*  Like even at our practice,
*  if somebody's putting their fingers out,
*  I tell them like, yo, close your fist.
*  Yeah.
*  That should be like a natural,
*  even thought, it shouldn't even be a habit.
*  Well, it's just such a natural instinct
*  to try to push a guy away from you.
*  Yeah.
*  And if a guy's coming at you
*  and you're trying to push him away,
*  those fingers go right in there, man.
*  You see the Weidman fight?
*  Oh my God, yeah.
*  Oh my God.
*  Oh my God.
*  And that's one of those two where you're like.
*  Same thing.
*  Bro.
*  Right.
*  But then I'm like annoyed by Weidman
*  because I'm like, bro, you did poke him in the eye,
*  but he's saying like, oh, he shouldn't have felt like that.
*  I'm like, bro, when you get poked in the eye that bad.
*  Yeah, that was a referee's problem.
*  Yeah.
*  So stop that on that last eye poke for sure.
*  But maybe he didn't see it,
*  maybe wasn't in a position to see it.
*  Yeah, it's just, it's hard.
*  I mean, I understand how hard it is for a ref,
*  even with stopping fights.
*  Sure.
*  Looking at somebody, who was this weekend?
*  Gerald Mearschart, where he was getting beat up
*  and then all of a sudden he caught up with a submission.
*  After that, you're like,
*  some refs would have stopped the fight in that round.
*  So it's like the good refs that give you a longer leash
*  and then the shorter refs that dominate cruise you
*  and dominate cruise you hate you for the rest of your life
*  because you stop a fight too early.
*  Who did Jared Cannoneer get stopped by?
*  Who was his, Jared, not the last fight,
*  but the fight before that, it was a bad stoppage.
*  Imad Abaf.
*  Imad Abaf.
*  Yes, that's right.
*  Nasreddin Imad Abaf.
*  And that was another one of those situations,
*  the same kind of situation where you're like,
*  that's not a stoppage.
*  He's standing up, he's up.
*  Yeah.
*  The last one, he got hurt harder by Boholio.
*  When he got dropped, that looked worse
*  than the fight where he got stopped previously.
*  And if you beat Imad Abaf,
*  Yes.
*  You're in title contention again
*  because he was on a streak,
*  but now you're on a two fight losing streak.
*  Yeah, and he's 40.
*  A ref stopped it.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  It's crazy how those little moments in a fight
*  can change the entire career of a fighter.
*  You never know.
*  Like at any moment, something screwy can happen, you know?
*  So is this it?
*  So here it is.
*  Imad Abaf is hitting him with some good shots for sure.
*  Jared's definitely getting hit,
*  but he's firing back and the referee stops it.
*  And he's like, what the fuck are you doing?
*  And hers is always a good ref.
*  He's a very good ref.
*  And he faced some serious criticism after that fight.
*  And I think, you know, he made a mistake.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, he was probably trying to save Jared
*  from further punishment.
*  He thought it was over, but Jared was like,
*  I got a lot left.
*  I was not as badly hurt as he thought.
*  You know what, the thing is,
*  the problem is when a guy is teeing off on you,
*  even if you're not getting hurt, it looks bad.
*  Even if you're moving away and covering up
*  and you're getting out of the range,
*  you're stumbling around, it looks bad.
*  But you could still come back
*  and you've got to give the guy the opportunity
*  to still come back.
*  You got to know, you don't let him take shots when he's out,
*  but you got to give him the opportunity
*  to be able to come back.
*  And when a guy's standing and still throwing back,
*  you got to give him a chance because fights are fights.
*  Things change.
*  Guys, he might've got burned out from that
*  because he emptied the gas tank.
*  We've seen that happen many times.
*  And there's some fighters that just look bad
*  and they make it look, just because their body movement's weird.
*  Right.
*  I mean, Driskes always looks like he's dead tired
*  and dead in there and all of a sudden he comes back
*  and wins a fight, but there's just guys
*  that just don't have that good look all the time,
*  even when they're taking punches.
*  Everybody's baffled by Driskes.
*  Oh my God.
*  Like, what is going on?
*  How's he beating everybody?
*  What is going on?
*  It's wild.
*  He's a bulldog.
*  That dude, I was stunned.
*  I was stunned by the Adesanya fight.
*  I was stunned.
*  Me, because Adesanya was looking good.
*  He was looking good.
*  But Driskes was looking good too, you know?
*  And Driskes was landing a lot of leg kicks.
*  He's got that real sneaky left high kick too.
*  That left high kick comes out of nowhere.
*  It's just awkward.
*  He just moves so awkwardly.
*  Awkward, but game.
*  Yeah.
*  So game.
*  He has so much heart.
*  Even when he started taking those bad shots,
*  when he was shooting, he was on his knees
*  and I was like, oh, he's about to break.
*  And then all of a sudden you see him still have
*  a lot left in the tank.
*  Oh, he's a tank.
*  He is a tank.
*  He marches forward, man.
*  And the way he capitalized, he hurt Izzy
*  with a couple of good punches.
*  One good left hook.
*  He hurt Izzy and Izzy moved away.
*  And then they got into another exchange.
*  He hit him with those two right hands from the clinch
*  and then got his back.
*  And once he got his back, it was like that.
*  Yeah, it was quick.
*  He went right to the choke, right to the choke
*  and cinched it up.
*  I mean, between the time he hit Izzy
*  to the time where Izzy was tapping was just a few seconds.
*  Yeah.
*  For me, I thought Izzy looked like he got
*  a lot tired faster than he normally does.
*  And I was like, he looked like he put a lot more muscle on
*  so that could have been a key in it
*  where his body wasn't used to moving like that
*  with the extra muscle.
*  But I was like, bro, he's moving a lot slower
*  than he usually would on this third round.
*  I always wonder, and I wanted to talk to him about this,
*  if he's ever considered doing one of those
*  Marv Marinovich type camps.
*  So Marv Marinovich, they had this philosophy
*  that the most important thing was your gas tank
*  and you already know how to fight.
*  You already know how to fight.
*  All you're getting better has already been done.
*  And in the six weeks or eight weeks, whatever your camp is,
*  you should be only concentrating on cardio.
*  And they would do these explosive plyometric things.
*  And BJ hated it.
*  He hated it.
*  But if you look at his gas tank from those fights,
*  it was unstoppable.
*  And when a fighter's not tired
*  and the other fighter is tired
*  and you realize all that work has paid off
*  and you start putting it on them
*  and you got this unlimited gas tank
*  and you also haven't been beat up in training
*  for six to eight weeks.
*  Cause you're really not sparring.
*  You're really not doing much of anything
*  other than your cardio.
*  They're just doing plyometrics.
*  It's all just jumping around and shit.
*  So you ever seen Marv Marinovich?
*  See if you can find Marv Marinovich trains BJ Penn.
*  They had BJ doing all kinds of wild shit.
*  That's all they would do, man.
*  That's all they would do.
*  Nick Curzon came on the podcast
*  and he was a protege of those guys.
*  And that's his philosophy as well.
*  He was telling me that it's really an elite fighter
*  that's fighting in a world championship fight.
*  They already know how to fight.
*  You just gotta give them the unstoppable gas tank.
*  And if you concentrate only on that,
*  it's the most important thing.
*  Cause when a fighter gets tired,
*  like when Izzy got tired in that fourth round with Drickus,
*  you could see he's not the same Izzy in the first round.
*  That's like lightning fast and moving and countering
*  and controlling distance and getting out of the range
*  of shots.
*  This is an Izzy that's experiencing fatigue.
*  But he already knows how to fight.
*  Like the fighting is in his DNA at this point.
*  He knows how to fuck people up.
*  And if he had like, here's BJ training
*  with the Marinoviches.
*  So it's all these plyometrics, even with the arms.
*  It's all this explosive shit.
*  Everything is done for time and distance
*  and they measure everything.
*  And he just breaks guys down physically to the point
*  where when they get into that octagon,
*  they just have the craziest fucking gas tank of all time.
*  It's an interesting philosophy.
*  Yeah, my mindset.
*  This going around.
*  Eli Alex Pineda spots Israel Adesanya injury,
*  draws partial confession from Stylebender.
*  He said, this guy knows me.
*  Said Izzy was injured.
*  He said he was noticing that he wasn't throwing kicks.
*  Like he might've been injured.
*  And then Izzy was like,
*  it's almost like this guy knows me or something.
*  So he's sort of admitting to being injured, but not.
*  Well, they clash in a bunch of times.
*  I mean, it could have happened in the fight,
*  but the problem is he was still tired.
*  Yeah.
*  He's still tired.
*  I mean, I'm sure he was injured.
*  It's a crazy fight.
*  You get injured.
*  In general camps, you get so injured in camps.
*  Yeah.
*  Like the hardest thing.
*  Like even when it's a fight quick,
*  people don't realize that I just had an eight week camp
*  of nonstop training.
*  You get more injuries in training camps
*  than you do in the fight.
*  What's the worst injury you ever went into a fight with?
*  It's funny.
*  I was in Australia and I was fighting two means.
*  And then me and my coach were in the back warming up.
*  And then we ended up going like knee to knee
*  in the back during the warmup.
*  And I could have put my knee down to the ground after that.
*  And it was like before the fight.
*  So I was like, what the heck?
*  I thought we just clashed knees.
*  So it was like sore.
*  So like even in the fight, it just felt weird.
*  So then after the fight, we went
*  and I still could have put my knee down to the floor
*  for like two or three weeks.
*  And then I ended up tearing my, it was a torn meniscus.
*  Oh wow.
*  Yeah.
*  But like right before the fight,
*  we just like clashed knee to knee.
*  And it's like you said, it's so much random stuff
*  that could happen to you.
*  Cause I like to spar in the back before my fights.
*  I like to feel it.
*  So I'll have them put a shin guards on a head gear
*  and I'm throwing a lot harder than them.
*  But I want to feel that so I can feel the distance.
*  Cause I want to go out to the fight.
*  Like it's my third or fourth round.
*  Cause I usually, I usually start slow when I'm at practice.
*  But in the fight I want it to be going right away.
*  And I have like cardio for it.
*  So like, I want to feel like it's the third round already
*  when I go out there.
*  Well, they always say that you should do that anyway.
*  Like really elevate your heart rate
*  and then cool down and then compete.
*  Yeah.
*  Some guys like to hit mitts,
*  but for me, I like to spar.
*  So I have my training partner come down there with me
*  and then you got to have a controlled guy.
*  It's not going to hurt you.
*  But yeah, we just go into back.
*  We throw.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, we're throwing.
*  So they have big gloves on and like, I get to the point
*  where I hit me cause I want to feel it.
*  So given in this fight with Leon,
*  he threw like 50 kicks at me hard at the back.
*  So I wanted to go out there like, all right,
*  my arms feel it, my legs feel it.
*  And my body's ready going to adjust to it.
*  Yeah.
*  That's so risky.
*  It's risky.
*  I'm like, I'm going to fight anyway.
*  Right, right, right.
*  And once you get that adrenaline,
*  like you don't really feel nothing
*  and I'll feel it afterward.
*  But like the biggest risk is just the head butter,
*  like catching your blood or something like that.
*  So that's why I make it wear a head gear.
*  And you know, like I said,
*  you have to have the perfect training partner for it.
*  Where he's going to throw the right stuff at you.
*  He's there for you.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  He's not going to...
*  He's not really sparring.
*  He's there for you.
*  Yeah.
*  If I tell you, all right, hit me right here hard.
*  He'll hit me here hard.
*  But it's not like, we're not going to just sit there
*  and bang in the back.
*  Right, right.
*  Wow.
*  Who else does it that way?
*  I don't know.
*  Like for us, we caught ourselves doing it.
*  Like I feel like I'm one of the first guys
*  to start doing it that I know.
*  And then I'll start telling my other teammates
*  when I go corner them, like, let's do the same thing.
*  And they'll like it too.
*  But yeah, there's not a lot of guys that just...
*  I know a lot of guys that just like hitting mitts.
*  And then you go out there and then you start a lot slower.
*  But for me, I'm like, bro, we're going to fight.
*  Like, I don't need to hit mitts right now.
*  I'd rather feel you throwing punches at me.
*  So I catch distance.
*  So I look at the punches coming at me.
*  And then I know where I'm backing up,
*  where I'm not backing up.
*  You're already loose, for real loose.
*  Yeah, because even when I spar,
*  I'm sparring like five or six rounds regardless.
*  So I know I could go five rounds easy in the cage.
*  Especially with that extra adrenaline.
*  So like if I do those extra two rounds in the back,
*  it's not going to affect me.
*  And you're going into the fight completely warmed up.
*  Psychologically too.
*  You're much closer psychologically to a fight
*  than just hitting mitts.
*  And then all of a sudden someone's throwing back.
*  Yeah, the mindset is the hardest thing, right?
*  To get locked in.
*  Because when I first started fighting, I was like,
*  I'm another guy, I don't like to curse.
*  But then I was like, I was telling myself,
*  I got to listen to rap music, I got to curse.
*  As I'm in the back.
*  And I'm like trying to hit myself to hype myself up.
*  But because I feel like I'm too calm.
*  But my coach is like, bro, that's a good thing.
*  Like you being calm is good for you.
*  You don't have to sit there and be something you're not.
*  So then I was like, all right, well, let's stay calm.
*  But then let's start adding in sparring.
*  So then I feel that.
*  So I'll just get it through that.
*  So it was your idea?
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah, because you try different things at practices.
*  And I'd be like, all right, when did I feel good at sparring?
*  I take notes of everything.
*  I felt good on this sparring day
*  and I did this type of drilling beforehand.
*  And where I did this type of warmup beforehand.
*  Because my coach, he's like,
*  he tries to mimic the fight with everything.
*  So he'll tell us, all right, warm up on your own.
*  Do your own thing, then we're gonna get
*  your five sparring rounds in the cage.
*  So for me, I'm trying to adjust to make my style.
*  All right, this helped me better today.
*  What did I eat today?
*  Let me write that down.
*  This is when I felt the best.
*  I had the most energy doing this.
*  I had the most energy eating this.
*  So now I got it down to a system
*  that I like more than anything.
*  What is the food you take before you train?
*  Before I train?
*  Yeah, what's the stuff that makes you feel the best?
*  Like white rice.
*  Usually my guy will make me white rice, eggs,
*  and turkey bacon.
*  So it's protein with good carbs.
*  Not heavy.
*  Not heavy, yeah.
*  Something's gonna digest.
*  Something's gonna digest fast, yeah.
*  Right.
*  Yeah, like I said before,
*  I would just think I have to starve myself.
*  And then he came and he was like,
*  bro, like what are you doing?
*  Like you're not gonna have good practices with this way.
*  But my mind said I don't really care
*  because I was just like,
*  I know how to push myself no matter what.
*  Yeah, well, having, you've gone through camps with Ramadan
*  and that's where it gets, and you,
*  we should tell people there's ways to kind of
*  make that a little easier on yourself
*  where you sleep during the day and then you get up
*  and then at nighttime, once you can eat and drink,
*  then you do that, but you don't do that.
*  Yeah, I've had multiple times, multiple camps during it
*  where I would still stick to my normal schedule of training
*  where I'll train at 10.30 a.m.
*  And I can't eat or drink in the morning.
*  So I wake up at 5 a.m. for a morning prayer.
*  You get your last sip of water before the sun rises
*  and then I'll have like a protein shake,
*  dates or something like that,
*  that'll give me some energy for the morning.
*  And then at 10 a.m. I have my morning practice
*  and then I have another practice.
*  You can't drink water in between rounds, nothing.
*  No, after the first-
*  So you're training with no water.
*  No water or food, yeah.
*  So after like the first three or four days,
*  your body just adjusts.
*  It feels good, honestly,
*  because it makes you feel like mentally
*  you're in a different place.
*  Like spiritually you're in a different place in general
*  because it's Ramadan and that's where like,
*  for any Muslim that's like the best time
*  because you're not stressing out about other things
*  and you know that you're doing it for God.
*  And you know God's gonna give you the strength
*  to push through no matter what.
*  So for myself, for the reasons I'm doing it,
*  I know I could push through.
*  And I know that whoever I'm training for
*  is not doing what I'm doing.
*  So I could push myself harder than them
*  when it gets into the cage,
*  when I can't drink, when I can't eat.
*  So I think mentally it just puts me in a different place.
*  But for fight camps, like after it's time to break my fast,
*  when the sun and sun sets,
*  that's when I have to be the smartest.
*  That's where I gotta put the carbs in, a lot of protein in.
*  And then I gotta make sure
*  that I'm getting my electrolytes, my salts
*  and just getting all the fluids back in
*  like I just finished cutting weight.
*  Right, right, right.
*  Because if I don't do it the right way,
*  then the next morning I'll be screwed.
*  Right.
*  Because I'll feel super drained.
*  That's interesting.
*  So you gotta treat it like you're cutting weight almost.
*  Yeah, so like every night I'm treating it like a weight cut.
*  I have my shakes, I have my protein
*  that I'm getting in the right way.
*  And I try to hit a certain,
*  at least a gallon and a half of water before bedtime.
*  Mm. Yeah.
*  Okay. Yeah.
*  Yeah, so that it carries you on
*  at least a little bit in the morning.
*  Yeah. And then like I said, after first,
*  your body honestly just figures it out.
*  But you wouldn't wanna defend the title that way.
*  No, no.
*  Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
*  Yeah, yeah.
*  Well, before I was trying to chase everything, right?
*  I was trying to chase the next ranked guy.
*  I was trying to chase this.
*  And I felt like I couldn't say no to anything.
*  Right.
*  Because I was always looking for these guys to say yes
*  and I can't waste an opportunity.
*  But now I am the opportunity.
*  Now I am the champion.
*  So now I feel like it gives me more leeway to be like,
*  no, I wanna wait a little bit longer.
*  This one feels better for me.
*  My body's healthy now.
*  Yes.
*  Because it took me so long to get here.
*  So now I don't have to go through a camp
*  during Ramadan for it.
*  But now it's about your legacy.
*  Yeah.
*  As a champion.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, and exactly all the things
*  we were talking about before.
*  The little thing can change your life.
*  Little loss here, little loss there.
*  Fuck all those taking those fights on 10 days notice.
*  Yeah.
*  If the UFC calls you 10 days before an event,
*  just change your number.
*  Change your fucking number, man.
*  Don't let them talk you into it.
*  I know you work out all the time
*  and you start thinking, yeah, I do work out all the time.
*  We're gonna offer you X amount of money.
*  You're like, oh shit, that's a lot of money.
*  And you start spending that money.
*  You're just like.
*  That's the hard part right now.
*  Is because, like you said, for me,
*  I hate saying no in general.
*  Just because I have the fighter mentality.
*  I ain't scared.
*  I'll say yes to anything.
*  The Gilbert Burns fight, it was three weeks notice.
*  It was during Ramadan.
*  And they were like, you win.
*  Do it for the fans that just bought their tickets
*  to their first event.
*  And I was like, yeah, I do wanna do it for those fans.
*  I'm not afraid of Gilbert.
*  And Gilbert started chirping on Twitter like,
*  oh, he's afraid.
*  He doesn't wanna fight.
*  So then I'm like, I do wanna fight.
*  I'm not afraid of you.
*  So then I'd say, yeah, no matter what.
*  Then it's like, I'm thinking to myself,
*  bro, I'm on a nine fight winning streak.
*  I'm taking this fight on three weeks notice.
*  Why did I do this?
*  I'm stupid.
*  If I lose, I'm back in the line again.
*  I was one fight away.
*  Now if I lose this fight, I'm done.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, it changes your mindset.
*  Fighters are dumb.
*  We just want the glory no matter what.
*  I wanna prove, for me, I wanna prove everybody wrong.
*  So you have to temper that mindset.
*  You have to think about the overall big picture
*  because what got you to the dance is that mindset.
*  Like anybody, anytime, let's go.
*  Who am I fighting?
*  I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready.
*  But once you got the title, so you gotta keep the dog,
*  but you also gotta be intelligent
*  about what fights you take and when you take them.
*  Don't fight injured.
*  So many guys take fights,
*  I had a broken foot coming into this fight, like what?
*  Yeah, afterward, right?
*  Yeah, what?
*  And those are the guys that, for me as a fighter,
*  if I lose, I lost, that's it.
*  I hate guys who come up with a million excuses afterward
*  because then for the guy that won,
*  it's like people are not gonna give him credit for that win.
*  And then for me, when I lost my fight,
*  I was like, all right, I gotta change this.
*  I lost, that's it.
*  I think that was always my mindset.
*  Don't give excuses.
*  If we're going into a fight injured, we accepted it injured.
*  That's it, that's it, put it out of your head
*  because if you go in there overthinking about it,
*  like, oh, I got an injured ankle, or I got an injured rib.
*  I said, no, I should never have took this fight
*  in between rounds.
*  You never want to second guess yourself in the fight.
*  And for me, I just try to clear my head of anything.
*  Once we said yes, our names on the contract, that's it.
*  We're all in.
*  So who do you think is next?
*  There's talk of Shavkat and there's talk of Kamaru Usman.
*  Those are the ones that I hear mostly.
*  I think, like you said, for legacy wise,
*  Usman is obviously the bigger name
*  and he was the guy that Dana said
*  it was the best welterweight behind GSP or in front of GSP.
*  But for boogieman wise and to shut up the naysayers,
*  I think it's Shavkat because he is undefeated.
*  He is the guy that everybody thinks is this killer.
*  And then for myself, it's like,
*  either one of them does a lot for me.
*  Usman, obviously, you'll probably pay
*  bigger pay-per-view numbers.
*  And then beating him, my resume's up there at GSP
*  because then I'll have Usman on my resume,
*  Leon, Maya, Wonderboy, all these big name guys,
*  Gilbert Burns, Brady.
*  And it's like, look at that resume.
*  It's neck and neck with his.
*  But Shavkat's also that,
*  oh, this young guy's gonna come out here and beat you.
*  Right after being Leon, everybody's comments,
*  oh, Shavkat, you can't do the Shavkat though.
*  Shavkat will kill you.
*  And my chip on my shoulder's like,
*  all right, let's go, I'm gonna prove you guys wrong.
*  Now I'm gonna show you guys what I can do.
*  Because for me, like you said with BJ Penn,
*  where it was like the strength conditioning
*  was his whole camp that one.
*  For us, we strategize everything.
*  My coach is so good at breaking down stuff.
*  We're so good at breaking down fighters
*  that I have a game plan for everybody
*  and a strategy for every single one of these fighters.
*  And I already have a strategy for Shavkat.
*  I already have a strategy for Usman
*  because I was chasing him so long.
*  And I've been watching tape on these guys for so long.
*  So I don't see anything from either one of them too
*  where I'm looking at them like,
*  I'm afraid of this guy because of this,
*  I'm afraid of this guy because of that.
*  I think Usman's a tougher fight than Shavkat,
*  if I'm being honest.
*  But I do see many ways where I can beat them both.
*  Because there's a lot of guys in the division
*  that have to fight a certain way, they're specialists.
*  Whether they're either grapplers or strikers.
*  I can strike with you, I can grapple with you,
*  I could wrestle with you, I can move laterally,
*  I can move forward.
*  Every time you see me in the cage, it's something different.
*  And I think that that comes from my team
*  and the strategy that we bring to fighting.
*  We look at it like a real sport instead of,
*  I'm in shape, let's go fight.
*  We look at it as like, what's this guy's weakest point?
*  Oh, Leon can't move backwards, let's move him backwards.
*  Gilbert Burns, he can't take you down,
*  he's gonna gas out.
*  He's not gonna take me down.
*  Let's beat him up on the field a little bit.
*  Brady, he's only good on the ground,
*  all right, let's strike with him.
*  It's like, I look at guys and I look at fights
*  in a different way than a lot of these other fighters
*  where some of these guys, let's go under, I see red,
*  I don't care what happens.
*  Right. Yeah.
*  I think for legacy, Usman's an important name.
*  Also because Usman probably won't be fighting
*  that much longer.
*  He's kind of at the end of his career.
*  And I feel like the UFC owes him a little bit something
*  for the Hamzah fight, takes Hamzah on short notice.
*  That was like 11 days notice too, right?
*  Yeah, in Abu Dhabi. That's crazy.
*  That's crazy, that's crazy.
*  And it was close.
*  Very close, and he was winning the third round.
*  But I was gonna say earlier about Olivera and Saryukian,
*  that's another fight where I felt like
*  that is a five round fight.
*  That should be a five round fight.
*  And Charles almost caught him a couple of times
*  in that fight.
*  I'm like, that's a wild close fight
*  between two top of the Fujian guys.
*  It seems wrong to have that fight three rounds.
*  Especially for number one contender status.
*  Especially Charles, who's been in there for so long,
*  was a champion, and he's like a different type of champion.
*  He comes balls to the wall no matter what.
*  So even if it's five rounds,
*  you're not expecting it to go five rounds.
*  But in general, I felt like it should have been there.
*  And he almost caught him a couple of times.
*  He got real close a couple of times.
*  And Charles is, I think he's the most successful finisher
*  with submissions in the history of the sport.
*  And now he's two fight losing streak himself.
*  But the last one was so fucking close,
*  and it's against Sarukian, who's the top of the food chain.
*  That 155 pound division, woo.
*  What happens if Islam decides to go to 170?
*  For me, I would never fight Islam.
*  If I get two more.
*  So how do you do that though?
*  So what if you, you're gonna, okay,
*  let's assume you beat Usman, let's assume you beat Shafkat.
*  I'm calling on Driscus.
*  Is that what you do?
*  You go to 85? 100%.
*  Really? Yeah.
*  Yeah, I feel if there's anybody that can and be willing,
*  who deserves it, it would be me.
*  Cause I had to fight five top five guys
*  to get to where I am now.
*  So I think at least two more,
*  then I can start talking about one middleweight.
*  So that's what you would do.
*  Islam would go to 70 and you'd go to 85.
*  Yeah, for sure.
*  Wow. Would you pack on size to go to 85?
*  Yeah, I mean, I would put on muscle,
*  but like in general, I've trained with a lot of 85ers.
*  And I think I have good size for 85.
*  Driscus is talking about going up to 205
*  and fighting Alex, which is crazy.
*  So maybe he vacates the middleweight title or maybe,
*  who knows, maybe he goes double champ status.
*  But I feel like there's so many guys at 85 for him
*  still to fight.
*  Oh yeah.
*  He's fought Izzy, he's fought Strickland.
*  Whitaker, he fought Whitaker.
*  He beat him. You got Whitaker,
*  but now you still got the young guns, right?
*  Brendan Allen, who's a dog, came against Imavov.
*  The winner I feel like should be there.
*  Hamzat's still there that people aren't even really
*  talking about anymore.
*  Hamzat wants to fight.
*  And I think Hamzat's at 70s, the scariest Hamzat.
*  But that weight cut's crazy for him though.
*  Is it?
*  What does he walk around at?
*  I've seen him out and he looks like over like two 15s.
*  He's like, Michael Morales, he just fought,
*  he just beat Neil Magni?
*  Yes.
*  He came to train with us.
*  I brought him in for Leon fight.
*  And he was like, I was like, bro, you're huge.
*  He's like, no, yeah, I'm like 190.
*  And then my coach like put him on a scale.
*  He's like 218.
*  I was like, bro, what do you mean?
*  What are you talking about?
*  He's like, oh no, I just had a bad breakfast.
*  And I was like, bro.
*  What did you eat?
*  You ate a whole ostrich?
*  What the fuck did you eat?
*  But he's so, he's young and he's huge.
*  And I'm like, this is not gonna last long, bro.
*  You can't cut this much weight.
*  No, he's big.
*  He's good too.
*  He's a dog.
*  He's good.
*  He's real good.
*  Just training with him.
*  He was like another one of those guys we brought in
*  and it was like, he was a perfect training partner
*  where he didn't like have ego,
*  where I'm fighting somebody in my weight class,
*  he's undefeated.
*  He'd come in and say, oh, he's fighting for the belt.
*  Let me go crazy with him.
*  No, he was such a good kid.
*  Yeah, he fought, trained really well with us.
*  And then to see him get out there and finish Neil Magne,
*  who he thinks like the perfect gatekeeper
*  for any like up and comer, right?
*  He's that test where you go past them.
*  It's like you're a real deal.
*  Yeah, that's the real deal.
*  And he looked great in that fight.
*  Yeah, he's a real contender.
*  There's so many real contenders.
*  And your division is just so filled.
*  And yeah, people forget, man.
*  Even Gary, JDM, like all these guys.
*  People forget about Jeff Neil.
*  You know?
*  Jeff Neil's a fucking killer.
*  He's going against RDA now.
*  Yeah.
*  That's funny.
*  That's a wild fight.
*  Yeah, I wanna-
*  RDA was another guy I trained with Nick Curzon.
*  Oh yeah?
*  Yeah, he was using that sort of,
*  when RDA was in his prime.
*  Yeah, him in his cardio days
*  where he could just go nonstop,
*  punching, striking, wrestling.
*  That's what we're talking about though.
*  That's what it was.
*  Wow.
*  He was doing that same kind of workout with Nick Curzon.
*  That's wild.
*  Does he still train people?
*  Curzon?
*  I'd have to reach out.
*  I bet he still does.
*  I know he was training a bunch of other athletes
*  in a bunch of different sports as well.
*  But his whole thing is plyometrics and foot strength
*  and your ability to move and continue to move.
*  It's interesting because I see both ways.
*  I see like, look, Sean Strickland
*  is the craziest fucking cardio of anybody, right?
*  Because all that guy does is spar.
*  He's fighting every day.
*  He spars more than anybody in the UFC
*  and he gets hit less.
*  That's nuts.
*  Yeah.
*  That's nuts.
*  So his cardio is from his being completely comfortable
*  with fighting all the time.
*  And I'm sure he does other things too,
*  but most of which, if you talk to Nick Sick
*  and all those guys that train with him,
*  most of the stuff, what he does is spar.
*  Yeah.
*  He just loves sparring.
*  He loves getting in there and sparring.
*  And he spars stupidly.
*  Stupidly?
*  Yeah.
*  There's guys that'll spar light and spar for distance
*  and managing and stuff.
*  And there's guys that just wanna throw it on.
*  I'm like, look at these guys.
*  But he doesn't get hit much.
*  The reason why he's so good at that,
*  first of all, that style is so weird.
*  Stands straight up, has the Philly shell
*  and throws punches in weird angles
*  and he's just peppering you, peppering you,
*  peppering you, keeping them on you,
*  keep tip to the body, front kick to the body,
*  peppering you, keeping on you.
*  It's a weird style, man.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a weird style.
*  It's like agitating, especially if you're a guy
*  like Adesanya who wants that distance
*  and wants it to look pretty.
*  To have somebody who's striking looks so ugly
*  just in front of you, just nonstop.
*  Or like against, what's his, Bochina,
*  where he just threw like 55 teeps at him every round.
*  Yeah.
*  I was shocked at that fight.
*  But that was a good example of how hard he is to hit.
*  He's fucking hard.
*  I mean, because I think, you know, for some reason,
*  I don't know what happened, but I think that,
*  I think some fighters, they just have like,
*  when Stylebender beat Bochina,
*  like he was kind of a different guy after that fight.
*  You know?
*  There's some guys that they have a fight
*  and for whatever reason, they never are the same guy again.
*  And it's not even a bad beating.
*  It might be like a psychological thing.
*  I think it's the undefeated thing.
*  He was undefeated in that fight.
*  Then you get your first loss and you,
*  like you don't have that same mindset anymore
*  because you were killing everybody.
*  Then all of a sudden you lose and you lose by finish.
*  You're like, was I not as good as I thought I was?
*  And you get dry humped.
*  Yeah.
*  When Izzy dry humped him.
*  Izzy has the best celebrations after any fight.
*  The fight with Pahara, when he knocks Pahara out
*  and he shoots the three arrows into him,
*  that's the greatest.
*  To be like thinking about that beforehand
*  is just wild.
*  And then to like put it out there, it was so beautiful.
*  I don't think he said he did think about that.
*  I think he just did that in the moment.
*  In the moment?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, that's wild.
*  Well, you know, Alex always shoots arrows at you
*  in the beginning.
*  I don't think there's a better,
*  there can't be a better celebration than that one.
*  No, it's the best.
*  Nothing's gonna come close.
*  It's the best.
*  And then the speech afterwards makes it even better.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, the speech was incredible.
*  That was really good.
*  Yeah.
*  Do you think we ever see the third one?
*  Who knows, man?
*  I don't know if Izzy wants to fight that dude again.
*  I don't think he wants to fight him at 205.
*  I think 205, you don't get a drain.
*  Alex Pahara, you get a destroyer.
*  Yeah.
*  What he just did to Prohaska,
*  everybody's gotta be nervous.
*  All he has to do is one shot, just touch you once.
*  And I think at 185, he doesn't take a shot as well either.
*  Yeah.
*  I think that draining of your body
*  and you know, your brain dehydrates the whole deal.
*  Yeah.
*  And Drikka said if he fights him again,
*  he doesn't want any excuses.
*  So he doesn't want Alex to come down to 85.
*  He wants to go up to 205.
*  But if you're fighting him,
*  like if your first move is not shooting a single leg,
*  I don't know what kind of coaching you have.
*  Right.
*  Because that should be your first goal.
*  At least in the first round, try to grapple him.
*  Something.
*  Yeah.
*  You gotta do something.
*  Yeah.
*  I never want to sit there and go toe to toe with him.
*  It's just too dangerous.
*  It's weird.
*  It's like some guys just have weird power.
*  Yeah.
*  It's weird.
*  It's like, it's different than everybody else's
*  by a magnitude.
*  So there's a large gap between his power
*  and everybody else's.
*  And with everything.
*  With kicks, with punches, anything he hits you.
*  That scissor knee that he hit Michael Adis with.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Woo!
*  And I feel like he's always sparring too himself.
*  He's always like posting videos of sparring
*  with like the normal classes.
*  Yep.
*  It's not like he's even had like crazy training partners.
*  No, he spars light.
*  He'll spar light.
*  He even sparred light with Strickland.
*  It's the only time Strickland spars light.
*  Strickland goes in there and spars with him.
*  He's like, let's just touch each other.
*  Yeah, I don't even want to feel him with big gloves on.
*  Yeah.
*  Fuck all that.
*  Yeah.
*  And he's talking about going to heavyweight,
*  which is even crazier.
*  Him against Aspinall would be wild though.
*  Wild.
*  But you gotta think Aspinall can take him down.
*  But what does ego want him to take him down?
*  Or are you like, all right, let me show you
*  how I can strike with you?
*  I think Aspinall, the moment he realized,
*  if he can hit him on his feet, he'll try.
*  But if he can't, the takedown's always there.
*  So that's, and he's so much bigger.
*  I mean, Aspinall's a solid 255.
*  And I think he's a black belt as well, right?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Wicked on the ground.
*  And he's had nothing but success.
*  Other than that one time where he fought Curtis
*  and his knee blew apart.
*  But that, you know, that's just a freak accident.
*  Yeah, it's crazy, right?
*  Like I can tell people that so many random things
*  could happen in a fight.
*  That could happen.
*  And then you look at guys that are undefeated for so long
*  and you don't respect how hard it is to get there.
*  Mm-hmm, yeah.
*  It's a crazy sport, man.
*  It really is.
*  And for you, what a journey to be 23 years old
*  and step into a gym for funsies.
*  You know, just trying to learn a little martial arts.
*  What the hell?
*  Next thing you know, you're the champion of the world.
*  It's wild.
*  That's wild, man.
*  Yeah, it's a blessing, right?
*  Like just thinking about the whole journey, man.
*  Like spiritually, it puts you into a different mindset too.
*  Cause you just thank God for everything no matter what.
*  And for myself, thinking of what, like I said,
*  I was going to school to try to be a lawyer.
*  And I always tell my mom, yeah, cool.
*  When I lose.
*  Like now I can go from that to being able to do something
*  like this every single day.
*  And being able to train every day.
*  That kind of a fight, a world title fight,
*  your first world title fight at five in the morning
*  in another country, bananas.
*  Yeah.
*  Just a crazy accomplishment.
*  Enemy territory.
*  Enemy territory.
*  People die.
*  But tired, tired enemy.
*  Yeah.
*  Sleepy.
*  It's like, ugh.
*  But it's wild cause the fans out there were crazy.
*  There were still so many fans.
*  We ended up having a parade that same night
*  because we got out of the fight, it was like at 7 a.m.
*  And then we had people out there that set up
*  like a parade for us in Manchester.
*  Oh wow.
*  Yeah.
*  And the streets were like crazy packed.
*  It was full.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  So you just stayed up.
*  Yeah.
*  Cause it was like 7 a.m.
*  So I'm like went back to the house
*  and everybody wants to come see you now.
*  So we're just chilling.
*  And then all of a sudden it gets to like noon.
*  And you take your, try to say,
*  everybody's taking a power nap now.
*  Cause we were up from the night before at midnight.
*  So it came up to like two, three o'clock
*  and then everybody started falling asleep.
*  So for myself, I'm still wide awake.
*  I mean, we watched the fight and then they were like,
*  let's go eat some food.
*  And they like surprised me with like a huge parade
*  at like one of their busiest streets in Manchester.
*  Oh wow.
*  And they said like, the streets got like shut down.
*  But they have like a huge Muslim population over there
*  in England area.
*  So like a lot of the, even before the fight
*  I was getting a lot of messages from people like,
*  you're not in enemy territory.
*  This is your home.
*  And we were blessed out there.
*  Cause people took care of us the whole time.
*  My team had food, everything, every single day.
*  Like even the gym, when I was first looking for myself,
*  a lot of the gyms I was messing out there were like,
*  no, you can't.
*  Like we don't, you're fighting Leon.
*  We can't open the doors for you.
*  Right.
*  Yeah. But then we met some guys that like
*  opened up their gym for us.
*  And they were like lawyers driving us around at 4 a.m.
*  They had other jobs, but they were driving us around,
*  staying up with us at 4 a.m.
*  And then having to go to work at like 9 a.m.
*  Wow. Yeah.
*  Well, they're probably excited to be a part of it.
*  Yeah. And that's what they, a lot of them said,
*  like, you know, we're just happy to be here.
*  We don't want nothing from you.
*  And it was just, yeah, it was such a cool thing.
*  That's amazing.
*  And you meet just like new friends, right?
*  New, new people.
*  And it was for my team, for my family, like
*  to have that journey all of us together.
*  My dad went, my mom didn't go.
*  What did it feel like
*  when they put that belt around your waist?
*  It was wild because like I had to try to think back to it.
*  And for me at first, it was like,
*  I told you so, like I told you I could beat Leon.
*  Like that was my mindset all the time.
*  I didn't want to even think about the belt.
*  It was more so to be like, I beat Leon.
*  You guys thought I was going to lose to him.
*  Every single, I had to live with it for three years
*  of everybody telling me I'm going to lose to this guy.
*  He was, he would have beat you the last four rounds.
*  He would have killed you.
*  And for myself, for that, it was just like,
*  I told you I could do it.
*  I told you I was better than him.
*  And his coach and his team were all talking trash to me
*  before the fight.
*  So just to like rub it in their face.
*  But then for me to have like,
*  to be able to wear the title, right?
*  And to like be able to carry my flag with the title
*  and to show people what's possible.
*  Because I mean, obviously, you know,
*  what's going on right now in the world for Palestine,
*  for them to have a champion right now,
*  for them to have a win from that fight.
*  That meant more than anything,
*  because I was getting so many messages from them.
*  We had people in Gaza that were watching video of it.
*  And it was kids at a refugee camp.
*  They were watching videos of the fight.
*  And it was such an amazing thing.
*  Yeah.
*  And then even from my coach right there, Mike Valley,
*  he's a small gym.
*  He doesn't talk big, right?
*  And for me to stick with him
*  and for us to do it together from the start,
*  now he has another world champion.
*  We're literally a tiny gym in there.
*  And he does so much for a lot of his fighters.
*  He brings a lot of guys in from Chile, Mexico.
*  And he puts them in like apartments,
*  doesn't charge them rent,
*  just like helps them grow from their start.
*  You just have to work hard.
*  That's amazing, man.
*  Yeah.
*  So yeah, a lot of it just comes back down
*  for my people in general.
*  Me, it was just to prove everybody that I could beat them.
*  I could beat Leon.
*  I told you so.
*  But now we got a real title and just attention.
*  So for me, it's like using that now.
*  You're calling the shots.
*  Congratulations, brother.
*  Thank you, my brother.
*  Very impressive, amazing.
*  It's a blessing, man.
*  I'm blessed to be here to talk to you.
*  I'm blessed to be able to like,
*  for people now to know my story, hear my story.
*  And in general, if I get to have conversation like this
*  and carry this belt around,
*  people will look at me and look at themselves with a dream.
*  Look at that, that's the parade.
*  Yeah.
