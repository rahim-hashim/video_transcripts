**Joe Rogan Experience:** [May 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by Dave, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6.4s)]
*  Which start with? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  Chu? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  Kodiak. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=16.12s)]
*  That's rough. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=17.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=18.12s)]
*  That's a lot. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=19.12s)]
*  So you could... [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=20.12s)]
*  But these are much better now. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=21.12s)]
*  Yeah, these are good. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=22.12s)]
*  These Lucy's are good. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=23.12s)]
*  I like these two. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=24.12s)]
*  These are athletic nicotines. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=25.12s)]
*  These are threes. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=26.12s)]
*  These are like, they don't fuck you up. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=27.12s)]
*  They're mild. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=29.240000000000002s)]
*  I wonder though, do you wonder at all, there's a lot of these studies coming out now about [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  how good nicotine is for you? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=34.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=36.64s)]
*  Where'd that come from? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=37.64s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=38.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=39.64s)]
*  All these nicotine pouches are selling like crazy. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=40.64s)]
*  It's like we're in the 1950s. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=41.64s)]
*  These are good smoking when you're sick, when you're pregnant. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=42.64s)]
*  Pregnant women. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=47.44s)]
*  You know, if you're sick. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=48.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=50.32s)]
*  I think there's real benefit to nicotine because that's been proven for a long time. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=51.32s)]
*  It's just always been the delivery method that's the problem. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=54.92s)]
*  Yeah, the Kodiaks and the other ones, there's a lot of other stuff in there that's not great [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=58.32s)]
*  for you. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=62.68s)]
*  I'm sure. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=63.68s)]
*  What is the one that has like actual glass in it? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=64.67999999999999s)]
*  Probably Kodiak or Grizzly, one of those two. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=66.24s)]
*  I think it's Skoll. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=68.52s)]
*  Apologies if that's wrong to those companies. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=69.52s)]
*  Yeah, but apologies to any company that we talk about. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=71.52s)]
*  People will fucking buy it anyway. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=74.08s)]
*  They're like, oh, good glass in it? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=76.48s)]
*  Good. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=78.56s)]
*  Makes it better. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=79.56s)]
*  Cuts your lip, gets it in there quicker. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=80.56s)]
*  I think that's the idea. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=81.56s)]
*  There's something abrasive in one of them that allows the nicotine to get into your [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=82.92s)]
*  bloodstream quicker. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=88.44s)]
*  Is it sure just one of them? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=89.44s)]
*  I feel like it's a few of them. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=90.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=92.44s)]
*  You can find anything out about that. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=93.44s)]
*  Yeah, that doesn't seem right. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=94.44s)]
*  But these are hot right now. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=95.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=96.44s)]
*  I mean, not in California because you can't get anything that's flavored. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=97.44s)]
*  Nothing flavored. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=100.44s)]
*  What a shit hole. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=101.44s)]
*  God, I'm so glad I left that fucking place. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=102.44s)]
*  Is there fiberglass in tobacco? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=106.64s)]
*  Fiberglass? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=108.84s)]
*  It's a complete mess. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=110.36s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=111.36s)]
*  I've heard this, although it gets repeated by many anti-ST. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=113.16s)]
*  What's ST? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=115.72s)]
*  Smokeless tobacco. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=117.92s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=118.92s)]
*  We've heard the claim that fiberglass creates little cuts to allow absorption. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=119.92s)]
*  Oh, so it's just bullshit. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=122.96s)]
*  That's good. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=125.96s)]
*  That's good to know. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=126.96s)]
*  That would be horrible. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=127.96s)]
*  The internet says it must be true. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=128.96s)]
*  Must be. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=129.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=130.96s)]
*  Chat GPT is never wrong. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=131.96s)]
*  We were talking about this lady that got arrested and she was bringing in frog embryos and they're [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=133.92s)]
*  trying to deport her to Russia, illegally bringing in frogs. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=142.6s)]
*  She's a researcher. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=146.44s)]
*  For what? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=147.44s)]
*  Research, I guess. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=148.44s)]
*  This is a different article than the one you sent me. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=149.44s)]
*  This is the one from April, I found, that still talks about her arrest and everything. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=151.64s)]
*  Okay, so she is also working on some cancer detection technology. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=155.51999999999998s)]
*  This article says that no one can fully unlock the data's potential except her. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=161.6s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=167.32s)]
*  And that's why they want to lock her up. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=169.4s)]
*  Well. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=171.28s)]
*  It can't just be frogs. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=172.28s)]
*  She's working for Harvard and she's got frog embryos that are illegally being brought back [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=175.12s)]
*  to the United States. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=181.35999999999999s)]
*  Something I was reading said that this generally is a fine, sometimes maybe a couple months [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=182.76s)]
*  of detention, but she's also asking to not be deported back to Russia. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=187.38s)]
*  She wants to go to France and that's part of the issue too. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=191.04s)]
*  Oh, it might be a thing where Putin's like, you have women. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=193.6s)]
*  She protested against the war in Ukraine. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=197.64s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=200.16s)]
*  There's a lot going on. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=201.16s)]
*  You have women that we are very interested in and we put frogs in her backpack. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=202.92s)]
*  You will find her with these frogs and then you will send her back to us. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=211.35999999999999s)]
*  We have to talk to her. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=216.6s)]
*  And they probably don't want to talk to her unless she, if she's been locked up since [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=218.16s)]
*  February for frogs. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=221.92s)]
*  Wait, we're just finding out about it? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=223.72s)]
*  You fucking murder somebody, they let you right back out. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=226.76s)]
*  Pull a knife on a cop, they let you right back out. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=230.24s)]
*  I think I'm going to get out. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=232.56s)]
*  Yeah? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=233.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=234.56s)]
*  Where you at now? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=235.56s)]
*  I'm still there. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=236.56s)]
*  What part? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=237.56s)]
*  I'm in Malibu. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=238.56s)]
*  Yeah, get the fuck out of there. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=239.56s)]
*  But Malibu is- [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=240.56s)]
*  It's nice. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=241.56s)]
*  We're not in the shit. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=242.56s)]
*  Yeah, but it's like having a beautiful house in the ghetto. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=243.56s)]
*  It's like, yeah, it's nice where you're at. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=246.92000000000002s)]
*  It's nice. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=249.4s)]
*  Beautiful ocean that's filled with toxic pollutants now. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=250.4s)]
*  So where's the best place to go though? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=253.4s)]
*  That's true. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=254.4s)]
*  I'm biased. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=255.4s)]
*  I think right here. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=256.40000000000003s)]
*  I like Texas. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=257.40000000000003s)]
*  This is the last stand. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=258.40000000000003s)]
*  This is the fucking, this is the Alamo. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=259.40000000000003s)]
*  It is pretty impressive. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=262.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=263.16s)]
*  Just how they've been able to disdain and you know, what happened with COVID. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=264.16s)]
*  Yeah, there's been a few states that held the line during COVID and it just shows you [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=270.36s)]
*  the importance of good government or just government that allows people to just be free [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=275.8s)]
*  and operate the way they'd like to. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=282.88000000000005s)]
*  I know there's a lot of Texans who wanted to keep the California out of Texas if you [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=285.44000000000005s)]
*  moved here. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=291.24s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good idea. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=292.24s)]

*  left with. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=296.40000000000003s)]

*  But why is everyone here voting red? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=298.8s)]
*  You shouldn't be voting red. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=302.52000000000004s)]
*  You need to be voting blue. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=303.84000000000003s)]
*  There's like cult members. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=305.44s)]
*  There's like Democrat cult members. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=306.84000000000003s)]
*  Just reasonable people. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=308.64s)]
*  Get blue no matter who. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=309.64s)]
*  But that's so goofy. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=311.2s)]
*  Red till I'm dead. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=313.2s)]
*  All that shit's goofy. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=314.2s)]
*  Look at the beautiful cities that we used to have in California. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=315.2s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=318.0s)]
*  I used to love LA. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=319.0s)]
*  I used to love it. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=321.64s)]
*  Every time I went back there, I'm like, I'm back. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=322.64s)]
*  When I travel on the road, I'm like, thank God I'm back in LA. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=325.48s)]
*  It's always sunny. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=327.92s)]
*  People are cool. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=328.92s)]
*  It's easy going. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=329.92s)]
*  And then COVID, just a big reality smack of how important government is. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=331.68s)]
*  You know what I've seen recently that makes me laugh is people driving Teslas, but they've [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=337.0s)]
*  either removed the emblem on the back or they have a sticker that says like an anti-Musk [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=342.36s)]
*  Tesla group or something. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=347.48s)]
*  I bought this before Elon went crazy. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=348.48s)]
*  I'd say 70% of them are wearing a mask driving still. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=351.4s)]
*  I think most of them are just scared their car's going to get fucked up if they leave [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=354.0s)]
*  it somewhere. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=357.0s)]
*  No, I think so too. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=358.0s)]
*  I think about that. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=359.0s)]
*  When I park my Tesla, I think about that. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=360.0s)]
*  Even in Texas, I feel like it's happening out in California. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=361.32s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of kooky liberals out here. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=363.32s)]
*  I get side eye from people out here. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=366.48s)]
*  They love the Tesla before, right? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=368.28s)]
*  They used to love it. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=370.8s)]
*  Kind of like the view in Trump. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=371.8s)]
*  Well it's also, there's a lot of, you know, it's the USAID stuff really. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=373.84s)]
*  It's hard to say. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=380.8s)]
*  I had Amanda Knox on here yesterday and she was talking about this program that was an [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=381.8s)]
*  innocence program where they're trying to release wrongly accused people and that it [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=389.48s)]
*  got defunded. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=395.08s)]
*  And I said, well, was there anything inappropriate about what they were doing? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=397.12s)]
*  Because there's a, the unfortunate reality of having conversations with Elon about this, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=401.36s)]
*  both publicly and privately, there's a lot of stuff that it looks good on the outside. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=406.76s)]
*  And then you find out you have this amazing slush fund. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=412.08s)]
*  You have fucking billions of dollars that's being allocated towards this one particular [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=415.68s)]
*  organization. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=420.6s)]
*  People are extracting enormous salaries and then very little of it is actually going. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=421.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=427.4s)]
*  So this is a part of the problem with these things like, oh, we lost funding. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=428.4s)]
*  Yeah, okay. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=432.68s)]
*  Yeah, that's bad. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=433.68s)]
*  You definitely want to have funding to help innocent people get out of jail. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=435.24s)]
*  But what the fuck were you doing? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=438.4s)]
*  Where's all the money going? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=440.12s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=441.12s)]
*  But I know a lot of them. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=442.12s)]
*  I know that they spent $251 million on transgender animal studies. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=443.32s)]
*  Like there's some wild money that's being thrown around. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=448.64s)]
*  They spent $2 million giving cocaine to dogs. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=452.28s)]
*  Super important to find out. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=455.91999999999996s)]
*  I really wanted to see the episodes of the 20 million they spent on the Sesame Street [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=456.91999999999996s)]
*  in Iraq. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=461.84s)]
*  Was Oscar still a villain or was it Big Bird? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=466.84s)]
*  Let's count the gays as we throw them off the roof. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=469.4s)]
*  $21 million. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=472.44s)]
*  Did you? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=477.6s)]
*  But how is the fucking common sense? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=478.6s)]
*  Like when people hear that, just because it's fucking Elon and some 20 year olds, they can't [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=479.96s)]
*  go, oh yeah, I'm glad you did that. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=486.68s)]
*  That's a waste of my money. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=488.52s)]
*  There was a study that was done recently that showed that 96% of all the stories that mainstream [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=489.52s)]
*  media prints about Elon are negative. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=495.64s)]
*  96%. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=499.44s)]
*  Meanwhile, the guy saved those fucking people trapped up in space. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=501.44s)]
*  You didn't hear a peep about that. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=506.28s)]
*  And the shit he does when there's natural disasters with Starlink. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=507.92s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=511.04s)]
*  He's revolutionizing space travel. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=512.04s)]
*  Revolutionizing satellite internet capabilities and the availability all over the world. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=515.48s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=523.88s)]
*  It's really crazy. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=524.88s)]
*  He's saving billions of dollars of your tax money from going to fucking fun, stupid ass [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=526.32s)]
*  programs all over the world. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=531.36s)]
*  Some of it is like you don't even know where it went. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=533.76s)]
*  It's corruption too. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=535.56s)]
*  He said that some of the money, that there was billions of dollars that was written out [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=536.8s)]
*  with no receipts at all. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=541.24s)]
*  He said if this was a private company or excuse me, a public company, they would be delisted [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=543.12s)]
*  and all the executives would be thrown in prison. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=548.36s)]
*  But in the government, it's just like standard practice. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=550.92s)]
*  How come nobody has gone to prison? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=553.28s)]
*  That's one of my main questions for Trump and the administration. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=555.0400000000001s)]
*  It's a good question. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=557.4000000000001s)]
*  Well, what's going on? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=558.4000000000001s)]
*  Well, the administration is only 100 days old, right? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=559.4000000000001s)]
*  Or 130 or whatever the fuck it is. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=561.88s)]
*  I think it takes a while to even find out what the fuck happened. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=564.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=568.44s)]
*  I've had conversations with people about it and it's like, Jesus, just trying to get the [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=570.08s)]
*  documents like when they're trying to get the Epstein files, like they're the state [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=575.1600000000001s)]
*  of New York. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=578.6s)]
*  One of the district attorneys was hiding, they were hiding documents that have forced [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=579.84s)]
*  them to give documents. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=584.04s)]
*  I think there's so many fucking powerful people that are on those lists. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=585.28s)]
*  There's so many powerful people that went and partied. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=589.28s)]
*  Air quotes, air quotes, partied. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=591.52s)]
*  And how many of them went to the ditty parties? [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=595.16s)]
*  Have you been paying attention to the trial? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=596.16s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=597.64s)]
*  Trials. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=598.64s)]
*  Wild. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=599.64s)]
*  Wild. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=600.64s)]
*  Why don't they air it the same way they aired the coverage that Johnny Depp got? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=601.64s)]
*  I know. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=608.48s)]
*  Why don't they? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=609.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=610.48s)]
*  They should. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=611.48s)]
*  The ratings would be amazing. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=612.48s)]
*  Like, what are you doing? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=613.96s)]
*  Why wouldn't you air that? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=614.96s)]
*  What's going to happen, though, you think? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=615.96s)]
*  Well, Diddy's going to be in jail for the rest of his life. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=617.96s)]
*  I think he's probably going to get it up. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=620.48s)]
*  I don't even think it matters. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=623.08s)]
*  I mean, a lot of it is... [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=626.96s)]
*  But then it's just another Epstein. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=629.88s)]
*  It's another Ghislaine Maxwell. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=630.88s)]
*  But there's murder cases. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=631.88s)]
*  Where somebody gets indicted and nobody else... [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=632.88s)]
*  Indicted for trafficking kids to no one. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=634.88s)]

*  Right. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=640.36s)]
*  That's the crazy thing about Ghislaine, right? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=641.36s)]
*  I mean, he's in prison for sex trafficking to who? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=643.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=646.24s)]
*  Boom. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=647.24s)]
*  I'm mature. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=648.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=649.24s)]
*  There's a lot of people that want some heads to roll. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=650.24s)]
*  Well, the Diddy thing has just started, so we'll see. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=652.76s)]
*  Because apparently there's a tremendous amount of video that they have. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=656.0s)]
*  But we've also heard that about the Epstein. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=659.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=661.32s)]
*  What are they going to do? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=662.32s)]
*  How much is it going to get out? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=663.32s)]
*  James O'Keefe just released video of Epstein's library, right? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=664.32s)]
*  I didn't see that. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=667.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=668.84s)]
*  He's been holding on to something and there's been fear about him getting taken out and [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=670.32s)]
*  Alex has some sort of kill switch or something. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=674.36s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=676.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=677.9200000000001s)]
*  But then he was like DJing. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=678.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=679.9200000000001s)]
*  A lot of his theatrics. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=680.9200000000001s)]
*  So O'Keefe is so... [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=683.12s)]
*  I mean, his undercover videos were amazing. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=685.32s)]
*  Incredible. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=689.32s)]
*  And then he got ousted at Project Veritas. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=690.32s)]
*  And then went on his own. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=693.32s)]
*  I wonder what happened there. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=694.32s)]
*  I'd like to know what the story there is because there's no official story of why he got ousted. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=696.16s)]
*  Has he not... [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=701.8s)]
*  He hasn't gone anywhere? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=702.8s)]
*  He's under some gag order maybe? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=703.8s)]
*  I would imagine there's some sort of an NDA or something. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=705.3199999999999s)]
*  Otherwise, why... [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=708.4799999999999s)]
*  The guy who releases everything, why wouldn't he release that if he can? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=709.4799999999999s)]
*  But his videos are mostly like gay men meeting up. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=715.1999999999999s)]
*  Yes! [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=718.56s)]
*  And one guy is kind of big dick and is, you know, oh, I can tell you this. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=719.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=723.92s)]
*  It has no idea. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=724.92s)]
*  Oh, by the way, everything he just said is... [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=725.92s)]
*  It's always chatty gay guys. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=727.4799999999999s)]
*  Here he goes in O'Keefe's Twitter. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=729.0s)]
*  Inside Epstein's library, O'Keefe releases never before seen footage with bizarre statues [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=731.4s)]
*  and cryptic messages left by Epstein from inside Epstein's island library. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=736.56s)]
*  By the way, what does that mean? [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=741.56s)]
*  If you look in this room, bizarre statues. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=742.9599999999999s)]

*  What that means? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=760.0s)]
*  Like plants, like planting people inside organizations. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=761.0s)]
*  Is that what that means? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=763.0s)]

*  I said, what the fuck? [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1539.96s)]
*  Well, that's nice. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1540.96s)]
*  I'm happy for him. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1541.96s)]
*  It's nice that they patched it up. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1542.96s)]
*  I went there last July. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1544.48s)]
*  Did you? [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1545.48s)]
*  Last, sorry, June. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1546.48s)]
*  How was it? [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1547.48s)]
*  Incredible. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1548.48s)]
*  Yeah, it was incredible. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1549.48s)]
*  Did you walk away thinking immediately, there's a lot we don't know? [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1550.48s)]
*  100%. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1553.76s)]
*  And what they tell you is complete bullshit. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1554.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1556.48s)]
*  I have a friend who went there and the archaeologist that showed him it said, this is complete [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1557.48s)]
*  bullshit. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1561.76s)]
*  Like, the narrative is complete bullshit. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1562.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1563.76s)]
*  He said, the scale of it and the technology involved in construction is beyond our current [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1564.76s)]
*  understanding of how to do this. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1573.12s)]
*  And it's not just the pyramids and the snakes. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1574.92s)]
*  The other temples are magnificent. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1576.72s)]
*  Not only that, there's probably a bunch of shit under the ground. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1578.68s)]
*  I know. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1581.52s)]
*  That's what I wanted to go see. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1582.52s)]
*  But the cool thing was the first temple I went in was what I'd seen on Ancient Aliens [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1583.52s)]
*  where at the very top of the temple you have one of the most famous hieroglyphs which has [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1587.68s)]
*  a spaceship, a helicopter, and a submarine up there. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1592.28s)]
*  As clear as you can possibly imagine. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1595.8s)]
*  Show that. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1597.44s)]
*  What the fuck is that? [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1598.44s)]
*  How in the? [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1600.2s)]
*  What is that? [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1601.34s)]
*  Explain that please. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1602.34s)]
*  Because that looks like a spaceship, that looks like a submarine, and that 100% looks [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1603.34s)]
*  like a helicopter. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1609.3799999999999s)]
*  So weird. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1610.9399999999998s)]
*  Egypt is the weirdest place on earth. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1611.9399999999998s)]
*  It really is. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1614.3799999999999s)]
*  But that's why it needs to be. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1615.3799999999999s)]
*  What the hell is underneath it? [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1616.82s)]
*  Well, I think that one. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1618.54s)]
*  That one right there? [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1620.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1621.74s)]
*  I mean, come on. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1622.74s)]
*  What are we talking about? [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1623.74s)]
*  Come on. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1624.74s)]
*  That's so crazy. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1625.74s)]
*  That's a spaceship or a fighter jet. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1626.74s)]
*  Some kind of a... [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1627.74s)]
*  That's a submarine. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1628.74s)]
*  It looks like a yacht. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1629.74s)]
*  Some old yachts that they keep getting compounded. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1631.14s)]
*  That's a helicopter. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1633.14s)]
*  It looks like a helicopter to me. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1634.14s)]
*  It looks just like a helicopter. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1636.66s)]
*  If it's not a helicopter, what a goddamn coincidence. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1638.14s)]
*  And you know, there's a bunch of weird stuff there. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1642.38s)]
*  A bunch of weird images. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1644.7s)]
*  And how about that one plane that they found that was inside? [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1647.5s)]
*  They found like a wooden plane that was inside one of the chambers? [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1651.02s)]
*  That's really normal. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1654.74s)]
*  They just buried there with the... [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1655.74s)]
*  That was the other thing that Zahi was unwilling to entertain was this King's List. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1658.34s)]
*  This Zeptec King's List that goes back 30,000 plus years. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1664.98s)]
*  They all want to pretend that that's a myth. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1669.74s)]
*  That all the other hieroglyphs are legitimately documenting the history of the region. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1671.86s)]
*  But not that one. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1677.06s)]
*  But when it gets past the narrative, these 30,000 year old kings, that place has probably [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1678.06s)]
*  been there for a long fucking time. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1683.74s)]
*  Yeah, probably hundreds of thousands of years. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1686.38s)]
*  Which is so crazy. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1688.94s)]
*  And it's probably built on other stuff. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1689.94s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1693.18s)]
*  Well, that's the other thing about the base of the pyramids. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1694.18s)]
*  It's like you have to realize there's a base there. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1696.9s)]
*  Before they put the pyramids up, they put this insane base. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1700.5s)]
*  And if what they're saying is accurate with these readings, that there's a structure that [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1704.26s)]
*  goes under the ground two kilometers. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1709.14s)]
*  Yeah, what is that? [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1711.26s)]
*  If they can find that, then you have to throw everything out the window. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1713.58s)]
*  But aren't you with me? [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1716.22s)]
*  Why are we not interested in that? [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1718.02s)]
*  Well we are. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1719.9399999999998s)]
*  But why is modern archeology not going, yeah, let's fucking figure this shit out. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1721.3799999999999s)]
*  Because modern archeology forever has been saying that we have the answers. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1726.5s)]
*  That we have the timeline. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1731.6599999999999s)]
*  We know when Khufu built this. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1733.34s)]
*  We know when Khafre built this. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1735.1s)]
*  We know who did this. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1737.06s)]
*  And they're not correct. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1738.6999999999998s)]
*  It's not accurate. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1740.86s)]
*  It's too weird. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1741.8999999999999s)]
*  There's no way you have all the information. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1742.98s)]
*  Also where'd everybody go? [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1745.38s)]
*  Like there's people living there, but it's clearly not the same civilization. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1747.6200000000001s)]
*  So what happened to this insane civilization? [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1751.54s)]
*  If there wasn't a collapse of society at an immense level, if there wasn't some sort of [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1754.5s)]
*  a civilization-destroying event, then where did it happen? [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1760.34s)]
*  Yeah, what happened? [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1765.5s)]
*  How about this idea? [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1767.26s)]
*  We got a new pope. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1768.26s)]
*  He's from the states. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1770.26s)]
*  He's from Chicago. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1772.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1773.26s)]
*  Let's open up the library of the Vatican. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1774.26s)]
*  Good luck. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1779.26s)]
*  Good luck doing that. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1780.26s)]
*  Have you been? [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1781.26s)]
*  I've been to the Vatican. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1782.26s)]
*  That's wild, right? [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1783.26s)]
*  You're like, what did you guys do? [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1784.26s)]
*  Where'd you get all this shit? [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1785.26s)]
*  When you're walking through it, you're like, what? [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1788.26s)]
*  The weird tapestries where you stand on one side and it looks like this, and the other [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1790.26s)]
*  side looks like that. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1793.46s)]
*  Insane art. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1794.9s)]
*  Like the craziest, but it's almost like a crazy person's house where they have so much [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1795.9s)]
*  art. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1799.78s)]
*  Almost like the studio. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1800.78s)]
*  It's stacked up everywhere, except it's worth billions of dollars. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1802.34s)]
*  I was laughing because didn't JD Vance get in trouble for pictures in the Sistine Chapel [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1805.62s)]
*  or something? [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1809.94s)]
*  Did he? [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1810.94s)]
*  Or what's the Sistine Chapel? [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1811.94s)]
*  I think he did. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1814.94s)]
*  You know you're not supposed to take pictures. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1815.94s)]
*  I remember going in there and they told you, put your phone away. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1817.94s)]
*  I'm literally in there trying to be quiet and everything, and everybody around me is [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1820.54s)]
*  loud. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1824.8999999999999s)]
*  They got their camera out to take a close-up. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1825.8999999999999s)]

*  Everybody around me when I was there was taking pictures. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1832.94s)]

*  It wasn't when I went either. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1846.3400000000001s)]
*  Everybody else was doing it in 2015. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1847.3400000000001s)]
*  Well, I went in I think 2018 or 2019 and we took a bunch of photos. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1848.3400000000001s)]
*  The photo was taken by an official White House photographer, and there's precedent for political [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1853.54s)]
*  figures being photographed inside. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1857.62s)]
*  The whole thing is weird. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1859.58s)]
*  The Vatican, the Vatican City, who guards the Vatican, why is it the Swiss Guard? [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1860.58s)]
*  It's a country. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1868.4599999999998s)]
*  It's a country. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1869.4599999999998s)]
*  You can't, nobody gets extradited from that when they're accused of crimes against humanity, [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1870.4599999999998s)]
*  like Ratzinger. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1875.78s)]
*  Who's Ratzinger? [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1876.78s)]
*  He was the pup that had to step down because he was one of the guys that was moving people. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1877.78s)]
*  Oh yeah, from like the spotlight. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1883.1s)]
*  He was one of those guys that was, when they would catch someone molesting kids, he'd move [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1885.8600000000001s)]
*  them to another place where one guy molested 100 deaf kids. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1889.78s)]
*  His old documentary about it. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1893.74s)]
*  He just looked creepy. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1895.3400000000001s)]
*  He looks super creepy. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1896.74s)]
*  But there's also like, of one of the buildings that the Vatican owns, there's a gay nightclub [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1898.46s)]
*  in the building. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1905.94s)]
*  Nah. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1906.94s)]
*  Like some gay sex club. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1907.94s)]
*  I can't believe that. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1908.94s)]
*  No way. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1909.94s)]
*  I know it's weird. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1910.94s)]
*  They probably didn't know. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1911.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1912.94s)]
*  It was a prayer center. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1913.94s)]
*  They were feeding hungry people or something. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1914.94s)]
*  Feeding some hungry butts. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1919.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1922.74s)]
*  It's just crazy how these elite people in power, before the internet, they were just [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1924.78s)]
*  doing stuff. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1932.78s)]
*  Oh shit. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1933.78s)]
*  They had complete control of the media and they were just doing whatever they wanted [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1934.78s)]
*  to do and everything was in secret and they had these little fucking meetings like skull [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1937.7s)]
*  and bone types meetings where they'd all wear cloaks and shit and go to Bohemian Grove [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1943.3s)]
*  and all that. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1947.78s)]
*  Has that shit not happened anymore? [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1948.78s)]
*  I think Bohemian Grove is very toned down now. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1950.6599999999999s)]
*  I think they use it now for meetings and stuff. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1953.3799999999999s)]
*  Thanks Alex Jones. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1956.26s)]
*  Yeah, Alex and John Ronson fucked it up for everybody. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1957.26s)]
*  But I know a bunch of people have been. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1960.54s)]
*  Kid Rock went. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1962.06s)]
*  He told me he went. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1963.06s)]
*  There's a feeder group to it. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1964.06s)]
*  Oh yeah? [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1965.06s)]
*  There's a feeder group to the main group, yeah. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1966.06s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1968.06s)]
*  It means they invite entertainers and different people. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1969.06s)]
*  So they say nice things. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1972.18s)]
*  Well then they figure out who they can hand select for the main group. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1973.6200000000001s)]
*  I got invited. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1977.38s)]
*  I did too. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1978.38s)]
*  I'm not going to go, no fucking way. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1983.02s)]
*  No fucking way. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1986.78s)]
*  I remember what Nixon said about it back in the day. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1988.58s)]
*  The faggiest thing I've ever seen. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1990.98s)]
*  These guys all got together when they know no one's around. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1994.22s)]
*  Did we talk last time about the Nixon, what's the Jackie Gleason story? [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=1996.94s)]
*  Yes, that's a wild story. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2002.4199999999998s)]
*  It's my favorite. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2003.4199999999998s)]
*  Of all the UFO stories, that's my favorite because it's plausible. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2004.4199999999998s)]
*  Nixon and Jackie were buddies. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2008.34s)]
*  If you're buddies with a guy and he likes to drink, the two of you are playing golf [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2010.5s)]
*  and drinking, he's like, you want to see some shit? [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2014.1399999999999s)]
*  That's what I would do, if I was the president, I'd be Jackie Gleason. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2016.86s)]
*  Bet him. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2019.5s)]
*  All right. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2020.5s)]
*  You win, I'll fund your campaign. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2021.5s)]
*  I win. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2024.22s)]
*  You show me some shit. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2025.22s)]
*  Yeah, right? [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2026.22s)]
*  Play around in golf. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2027.22s)]
*  I want to see Area 51. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2028.22s)]
*  I want to see Area 51. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2029.8600000000001s)]
*  If they brought you, would you open your mouth? [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2032.14s)]
*  They said, Aaron, we're going to take you, but you got to just keep this on a DL. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2034.02s)]
*  I think so. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2037.8600000000001s)]
*  I think so too. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2038.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2039.8600000000001s)]
*  I want to see some shit. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2040.8600000000001s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2041.8600000000001s)]
*  The remote viewing stuff in Area 51 is pretty wild though. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2042.8600000000001s)]
*  People have talked about it and you had a person talking about remote viewing recently, [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2044.7s)]
*  but how it's guarded by, I mean, the CIA has been doing it forever. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2048.38s)]
*  Finally, some of that is declassified, but they have their remote viewing guards who [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2051.86s)]
*  guard secret places like that, especially Area 51 is pretty wild. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2056.94s)]
*  They're remote viewing while they're guards? [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2060.58s)]
*  They have guards whose role is your remote viewing guard. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2062.82s)]
*  So their duty is they go into their astral bodies and guard the facility. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2068.1s)]
*  What does that entail? [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2072.94s)]
*  Like, what are they guarding it from? [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2074.9s)]
*  From other astral viewers who try and get in there. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2077.4s)]
*  What? [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2079.62s)]
*  Like you block them? [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2080.62s)]
*  There's been a lot of people online who've talked about this. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2081.62s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of people online who talk about a lot of things though, unfortunately. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2082.62s)]
*  I'm open-minded with this remote viewing stuff because the HAL put-off stuff was fascinating [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2086.94s)]
*  when he was describing it, like how accurate it had been. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2091.66s)]
*  When there was that crashed jet from Russia that they were trying to recover and they [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2095.2999999999997s)]
*  found it within a couple mile radius. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2099.7799999999997s)]
*  They were able to recover it before Russia was. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2102.18s)]
*  It's pretty wild. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2105.46s)]
*  If that's a real ability that people have. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2107.2599999999998s)]
*  You think it's bullshit? [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2111.06s)]
*  No. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2112.06s)]
*  No, I don't think it's bullshit. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2113.06s)]
*  I think they spent too much money on it and they researched it for too long for it to [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2114.18s)]
*  be total bullshit. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2117.7s)]
*  And HAL put-off was very compelling. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2119.22s)]
*  I've never seen it in action though. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2121.62s)]
*  So I've remained ... You've never seen what? [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2124.54s)]
*  Somebody ... Remote view. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2128.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2129.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2130.3399999999997s)]
*  You got to practice. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2131.3399999999997s)]
*  I would like to know. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2132.3399999999997s)]
*  I mean, imagine if someone could show you how to do it and you could do it. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2133.3399999999997s)]
*  That'd be great. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2136.3399999999997s)]
*  I'd love to. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2137.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2138.3399999999997s)]
*  Where would you go with it? [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2139.3399999999997s)]
*  Area 51. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2140.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, 100%. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2141.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, right in the ... [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2142.3399999999997s)]
*  If you could time remote view, I'd go right into when Bob Lazar was working there. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2144.2200000000003s)]
*  Like, show me. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2148.06s)]
*  I'd go Roswell 1947. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2149.06s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2150.06s)]
*  That's the big one. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2151.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2152.06s)]
*  There's a lot of those, man. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2153.06s)]
*  We were talking off camera about that element. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2154.06s)]
*  115? [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2158.02s)]
*  115. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2159.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2160.02s)]
*  How long do you think it is? [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2161.02s)]
*  Because one thing to think about is if you think our parents' age, right? [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2162.02s)]
*  that they lived through technological and all the advances since 50s, 60s and stuff [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2168.26s)]
*  to now. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2174.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2175.3s)]
*  Fast forward another 30, 40 years for us. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2176.3s)]
*  At what point does some of this technology really come out? [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2178.3s)]
*  The anti-gravity stuff, the disclosure, the UFOs, the ... [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2182.5400000000004s)]
*  It's a good question. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2185.38s)]
*  What Hal Puthoff said was that during the Bush administration, they put together a panel [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2187.46s)]
*  of scientists and experts and they gave them a task. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2192.42s)]
*  The task was compile a list of things that would be disrupted by disclosure. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2197.14s)]
*  They said, if we disclose that we have recovered crashed vehicles of non-human intelligence [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2202.22s)]
*  and biological remains, what would be the implications? [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2209.22s)]
*  They had a list of pros, things that would be disrupted and then things that we would [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2214.98s)]
*  benefit from and they put a numerical value to each one of them and it was overwhelming [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2221.22s)]
*  by every one of them that it would be overall negative. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2226.0s)]
*  They decided not to disclose. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2229.16s)]
*  What was on the con side beside religion? [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2231.2400000000002s)]
*  Because I know religion is a big part of it. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2232.8s)]
*  Religion was a big part of it. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2234.88s)]
*  Government. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2236.6s)]
*  Why would anybody believe that we have control over anything if there are some super intelligent [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2237.6s)]
*  beings from some unknown realm, whether it's another planet or another dimension that have [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2244.28s)]
*  technology far beyond our comprehension? [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2250.48s)]
*  Then there's the religious aspect, which gets really weird that Lazar talked about, where [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2254.7200000000003s)]
*  there's this immense folder that he encountered that has to do with religion, that has to [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2259.04s)]
*  do with how aliens created these religions in order to protect what they say human beings [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2264.48s)]
*  are here for, that we're containers. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2271.32s)]
*  So like, of what? [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2273.6400000000003s)]
*  And he said, I don't know. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2276.32s)]
*  They referred to us as containers. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2278.44s)]
*  And the religion was designed to sort of keep the peace or to keep some sort of a moral [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2281.12s)]
*  structure. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2285.2s)]
*  And the idea is if we had this disclosure and this information that the moral structure [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2287.3199999999997s)]
*  and the moral fabric of society would disintegrate? [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2291.52s)]
*  It would crumble because we wouldn't be able to control people at all. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2294.12s)]
*  If we all knew that there was something beyond our comprehension that's here all the time [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2298.4s)]
*  that can hide in plain sight, that lives in the ocean, they have bases in the ocean, they [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2304.72s)]
*  can mask their appearance and fly at insane rates of speed and just appear in places. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2311.2400000000002s)]
*  And they essentially have complete control over everything that goes on on Earth. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2318.1600000000003s)]
*  That would, you know, we would lose all of our faith in any sort of governmental institution [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2323.36s)]
*  because these are just fools. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2328.84s)]
*  Well, they think it's bad. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2330.84s)]
*  And they're, you know, to have this power and all of a sudden it just gets taken away [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2333.2400000000002s)]
*  voluntarily by you. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2338.72s)]
*  Like, if they could go back in time and stop the Internet, don't you think they would? [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2341.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2346.68s)]
*  I don't think they had any idea what the Internet was going to be when they released it. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2347.68s)]
*  They're probably like, what could be the harm of letting people get on AOL? [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2350.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2354.24s)]
*  You've got mail. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2355.24s)]
*  They're going to be tired from the dial-up. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2356.24s)]
*  It's going to take too long. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2357.24s)]
*  People are going to lose interest. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2358.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2359.24s)]
*  Nobody had any idea that you were going to be carrying 5G data in your phone, in your [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2360.24s)]
*  pocket that's capable of sending video all over the world instantaneously. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2365.8s)]
*  And then social media where you could share that information and people would upload it [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2370.6400000000003s)]
*  to thousands of other places instantaneously of no control over information anymore. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2374.5s)]
*  Before they used to have total control of the distribution of any information. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2380.6400000000003s)]
*  They had complete control of propaganda. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2383.84s)]
*  And they don't now? [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2386.44s)]
*  No. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2387.44s)]
*  No, they don't. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2388.44s)]
*  They don't have total control, but they have control. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2389.44s)]
*  We're talking. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2391.44s)]
*  So they don't have total control. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2392.44s)]
*  They don't have total control if we're talking. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2395.48s)]
*  They don't have total control, but they have total viewing access. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2396.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2400.56s)]
*  Well, that's the weird thing about the UFO stuff, right? [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2401.56s)]
*  Because there's two problems with disclosure. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2405.12s)]
*  One of the problems is these people who were involved in these programs had to have lied [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2408.34s)]
*  to Congress. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2415.12s)]
*  There's misappropriation of funds. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2416.12s)]
*  They had to get money in some sort of a way and they got this money through some sort [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2417.44s)]
*  of a misappropriation of funds and that is highly illegal. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2423.0s)]
*  So there has to be, this is that age of disclosure documentary. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2425.56s)]
*  I don't know if you saw it. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2429.8s)]
*  It hasn't come out yet, but they had a screening at South by Southwest. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2430.8s)]
*  Jamie and I saw it. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2434.72s)]
*  It's really good. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2436.18s)]
*  It's really incredible. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2437.48s)]
*  But it's all people talking about what they know, what they've seen and what kind of problems. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2438.48s)]
*  Is Bob one of the guys? [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2444.64s)]
*  Bob's not one of the guys, but Hal Pudoff's in there. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2446.44s)]
*  Oh yeah, Hal was talking about that. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2448.6s)]
*  I mean, there's a ton of people. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2450.68s)]
*  When's that coming out? [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2451.68s)]
*  I do not know. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2452.68s)]
*  Is it coming out theater wise or is it coming out like on a streaming service? [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2453.68s)]
*  It'll probably come out on a streaming service, I had a guess, but it could come out in the [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2456.6s)]
*  theaters as well. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2459.8s)]
*  They're not going to try and bury it? [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2460.8s)]
*  No, I mean, I don't think you can at this point. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2461.8s)]
*  Too big. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2464.2400000000002s)]
*  Everybody already knows that it's done and it's out there. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2465.2400000000002s)]
*  I think that's how disclosure is ultimately going to happen. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2467.64s)]
*  It's just going to just, one day there's going to be like, there it is. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2469.52s)]
*  They think this documentary is going to break the well. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2472.68s)]
*  Really? [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2475.48s)]
*  Break the dam rather. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2476.48s)]
*  Yeah, they think this one's pretty intense. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2477.48s)]
*  It's got basically everybody that worked on Christopher Mellon, all these different people [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2479.88s)]
*  that worked on all these different programs saying exactly what we have, what we know, [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2482.96s)]
*  how long it's been going on. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2486.44s)]
*  And this is why they have not released these things. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2488.04s)]
*  So there's that, there's that aspect of it, the lying to Congress, the misappropriation [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2490.92s)]
*  of funds. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2494.6800000000003s)]
*  And then there's the other thing is that how do you work on this stuff? [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2495.7200000000003s)]
*  Well, the government can't really do it on their own. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2499.12s)]
*  So what do they do? [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2501.52s)]
*  They bring in defense contractors that make jets and spaceships and shit. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2502.52s)]
*  Those are the people that get access to this material. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2506.44s)]
*  If they do have back engineered crafts and if they do have something that they recovered [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2508.84s)]
*  that's a crashed vehicle of non-human intelligence, non-human origin, not of this world, and they're [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2513.04s)]
*  back engineering this, that company that's back engineering that has an enormous advantage [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2519.8s)]
*  over their competitors. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2525.6000000000004s)]
*  And so their competitors would just sue because like, why would you give them access to, why [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2527.04s)]
*  would Raytheon get access to it when GE doesn't or, you know, whatever the company is? [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2532.04s)]
*  So they outlined the issues with, you know, disclosure and the resolution they said there [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2539.04s)]
*  has to be some sort of a blanket amnesty to everybody that worked in that program. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2545.08s)]
*  And they have to say that's the only way. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2549.56s)]
*  That's how they do it though. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2552.4s)]
*  But that's how they have to do it. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2553.4s)]
*  If we're going to find out the information, we have one of two things we have to accept. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2555.36s)]
*  You know, we have to either accept that these people are going to be able to keep this stuff [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2559.8s)]
*  in power because, or the people that are in power are going to be able to keep this stuff [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2563.48s)]
*  secret because if they don't, then they're going to get in trouble and they're never [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2566.76s)]
*  going to release it. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2570.4s)]
*  And so we're all going to be in the dark forever. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2571.4s)]
*  Or we just say, okay, in that, within that scenario, they're going to be off the hook [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2573.5600000000004s)]
*  no matter what. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2578.44s)]
*  So let's just let them off the hook for the greater good of mankind and understand what [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2579.44s)]
*  the fuck we're really looking at. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2584.28s)]
*  What are we really dealing with? [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2585.7200000000003s)]
*  What do we really know? [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2587.1600000000003s)]
*  And so I'm hopeful that that's a possibility. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2589.0400000000004s)]
*  So am I. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2592.2000000000003s)]
*  And especially the last 10 years, there's been so much stuff that's been out there. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2593.2000000000003s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2595.5200000000004s)]
*  Basically from 2017, from that New York Times article in 2017, when it was on the front [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2597.28s)]
*  page of the New York Times, that kind of opened up a lot of people's eyes. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2602.68s)]
*  Like, okay, this is a real story now because now it's not ridiculous anymore. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2605.28s)]
*  And now the next step is putting it out there. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2609.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, but I mean, there's got to be a lot of bullshit. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2613.12s)]
*  There's a lot of fake stuff. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2616.44s)]
*  There's a lot of misinformation. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2617.44s)]
*  Don't you think that we're at least 10 to 20 years behind even whistleblowers, what [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2618.44s)]
*  they actually have? [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2624.24s)]
*  Even if they were to release some of the stuff, they still have other stuff that's just so [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2625.66s)]
*  far more advanced than we could possibly imagine. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2629.62s)]
*  I would imagine. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2631.86s)]
*  I bet they have some. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2632.86s)]
*  That's what's crazy. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2634.86s)]
*  They can keep a lid on that though. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2635.86s)]
*  That is crazy. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2636.86s)]
*  It's impressive. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2638.02s)]
*  But we just both said that we would shut up. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2639.2200000000003s)]
*  That's true. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2642.46s)]
*  I mean, especially in today's day and age. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2644.58s)]
*  Well, the threat of death is a pretty strong motivator for... [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2647.58s)]
*  Also there's no way to hide that stuff unless you're a chatty gay guy and James O'Keefe [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2651.82s)]
*  gets you on camera. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2655.98s)]
*  Get off Grindr. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2656.98s)]
*  Watch out. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2657.98s)]
*  I wonder what apps they're using to get those chatty gay guys to give up all the juice. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2658.98s)]
*  That's pretty impressive. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2667.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2668.42s)]
*  Yeah, I would stop hiring chatty gay guys if I was involved in anything secret. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2669.42s)]
*  Don't do it. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2673.34s)]
*  Don't hide something. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2674.34s)]
*  They'll spill the beans. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2675.34s)]
*  They've got a lot of the big fish too. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2676.34s)]
*  I know. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2678.38s)]
*  It's incredible. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2679.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2680.38s)]
*  Guys. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2681.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2682.38s)]
*  Pretty wild. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2683.38s)]
*  CNN. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2684.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2685.38s)]
*  Yeah, wild. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2686.38s)]
*  Stuff that you should be in jail for what they found. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2687.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2689.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2690.42s)]
*  All that stuff is horrible. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2691.42s)]
*  But again, nobody goes to jail. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2692.42s)]
*  Nobody gets held accountable. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2693.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2694.42s)]
*  Except this lady with her frogs. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2695.42s)]
*  That lady's a problem. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2696.42s)]
*  Well, if you're threatening the establishment, she probably is. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2697.42s)]
*  She probably figured something out. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2701.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2702.86s)]
*  The illusion of freedom. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2703.86s)]
*  We have a lot more freedom than every other country, but still, it's an illusion. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2704.86s)]
*  But you can't go after the, you know, in this country, two of the big ones are vaccines [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2709.7s)]
*  and cancer. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2716.06s)]
*  And that's what I've been actually diving deep into the last about year because I've [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2717.06s)]
*  had a number of people in my life get cancer. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2721.8999999999996s)]
*  And you've had a lot of people on the show who've talked about, you know. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2724.74s)]
*  That's V40. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2727.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2728.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2729.98s)]
*  But also the remedies they've been using. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2730.98s)]
*  Me and Mel Gibson, you're talking about Fenben and ivermectin. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2731.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2735.46s)]
*  And that's what I've been in the weeds, you know, learn about the last year or so. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2736.7s)]
*  It's really fascinating. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2741.7400000000002s)]
*  Such a disservice to humankind by demonizing ivermectin in order to push vaccines. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2742.92s)]
*  Because in so many sheep and so many dullards and so many people that are just boomers that [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2749.62s)]
*  believe everything that's in the news, ivermectin is a fool's medication. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2754.94s)]
*  Even today. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2759.1s)]
*  Today. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2760.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2761.1s)]
*  Even today. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2762.1s)]
*  Like, have you told, they would have to be dying of cancer to even consider taking that. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2763.1s)]
*  Yeah, I had a doctor tell me that was, why would you want to take horse paste? [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2766.34s)]
*  What a dumb doctor. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2770.5800000000004s)]
*  What the fuck are you talking about? [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2771.5800000000004s)]
*  What a dumb ass doctor. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2773.46s)]
*  Imagine saying that. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2774.82s)]
*  Did you ask him, do you know the history of the use of that drug? [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2776.6200000000003s)]
*  I did. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2781.38s)]
*  It ended the conversation. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2782.38s)]
*  It was like. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2783.38s)]
*  It's literally like saying penicillin. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2784.38s)]
*  Don't take penicillin. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2786.02s)]
*  They use that on dogs. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2787.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2788.02s)]
*  I don't care if it's got a Nobel Prize. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2789.02s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2791.9s)]
*  Nobel Prize for use in humans on the World Health Organization's list of essential medications. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2792.9s)]
*  And horse paste. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2798.94s)]
*  The thing about cancer is wild is that the majority of doctors during this process will [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2799.94s)]
*  not touch diet at all. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2806.46s)]
*  It will tell you diet makes zero difference. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2809.14s)]
*  And my problem is the same problem I have with the vaccine and really the medical industry [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2812.6600000000003s)]
*  in general is there's no more informed consent. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2816.94s)]
*  The informed consent around cancer would be that it's a metabolic issue. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2820.58s)]
*  And because it's a metabolic issue and you're talking about anaerobic cells, then restricting [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2824.38s)]
*  sugar from your diet is a good place to start. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2829.18s)]
*  And none of these fucking doctors will talk about diet, sugars, glucose, anaerobic cells, [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2831.82s)]
*  nothing at all. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2837.54s)]
*  No, someone I'm close to. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2838.54s)]
*  We do radiation and chemo. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2839.54s)]
*  That's it. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2840.54s)]
*  Well, it's very profitable. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2841.54s)]
*  Extremely profitable. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2842.54s)]
*  The problem is chemotherapy, doctors are incentivized in a way to prescribe. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2843.54s)]
*  Yes. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2849.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, they're both profitable, which is really dangerous. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2850.7799999999997s)]
*  It's really dangerous when you make more money if you give people medication, because then [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2854.5s)]
*  you get doctors like that doctor in Ohio that got arrested that was giving chemotherapy [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2858.66s)]
*  to people that didn't have cancer. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2863.18s)]
*  He did it like a lot of people. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2864.8599999999997s)]
*  He just was trying to make more money. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2867.54s)]
*  And when you incentivize, and they're in that kind of a position of power where most people [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2870.2599999999998s)]
*  don't know what's going on and this is the voice of authority and they're like, look, [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2874.2799999999997s)]
*  it doesn't matter. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2879.14s)]
*  It doesn't matter at all. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2880.14s)]
*  They told it to someone close to me that got cancer. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2881.14s)]
*  Diet doesn't matter at all. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2883.1800000000003s)]
*  Well, of course it matters. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2884.1800000000003s)]
*  It matters to everything. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2885.5s)]
*  And it certainly matters to your metabolic health and your fucking immune system. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2886.5s)]
*  And then we know for a fact that cancer thrives on glucose. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2890.3s)]
*  If you're in like a high sugar diet and a highly processed food diet, that is you're [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2894.7000000000003s)]
*  ripe for inflammation. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2899.14s)]
*  You're going to get all kinds of inflammation that you wouldn't get if you were on a restricted [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2900.9s)]
*  diet that's higher in animal fats and low in processed sugar. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2905.42s)]
*  Yeah, ketogenic diet is a great place to start because you're restricting your body. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2912.42s)]
*  But there was another article recently about ketogenic diets are giving people cancer or [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2916.42s)]
*  that people are getting heart attacks and strokes on ketogenic diets. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2921.1s)]
*  Like by the American Medical Association written by them? [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2924.2200000000003s)]
*  It's probably by the same people that paid off the people to say that sugar wasn't the [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2928.26s)]
*  cause of heart disease and that it was saturated fat, the ones that was going on in the 50s [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2933.22s)]
*  and the 60s. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2938.22s)]
*  The food pyramid creators probably? [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2939.22s)]
*  Yeah, it's a mess. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2941.5s)]
*  But fortunately there's enough alternative sources of information that some people, I [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2944.14s)]
*  would estimate it's like between 10 and 30 percent of the people are getting the truth. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2949.4199999999996s)]
*  And then there's 70 percent of the people that either don't have friends that know these [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2954.4599999999996s)]
*  things, don't have access to these websites, aren't getting informed that there's a lot [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2958.5s)]
*  of these people that are doctors who are very credentialed experts in their field who have [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2963.5s)]
*  stepped outside of the narrative and they're doing it because they feel they have a moral [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2968.78s)]
*  obligation. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2972.54s)]
*  They're saying like this is a problem, this SV40 that we find in vaccines, simian virus [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2973.54s)]
*  440 is known to cause cancer and they found traces of it in the COVID-19 vaccine. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2979.14s)]
*  And so in some of the batches of the COVID-19 vaccine they find SV40. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2985.7s)]
*  SV40 gives people cancer, boom in cancer, no connection. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2989.9s)]
*  Isn't it ripe too that AstraZeneca is making a cancer vaccine? [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2995.42s)]
*  Well, that's just because they're nice. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=2999.7s)]

*  I just saw that. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3008.94s)]
*  It means, Jamie bring it up, what does it mean again? [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3009.94s)]

*  Okay, what are they saying it said? [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3037.02s)]
*  Weapon to kill. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3039.38s)]
*  Posts claim AstraZeneca means weapon to kill. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3041.3s)]

*  Captions, but what does it really mean? [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3063.7400000000002s)]
*  What are they saying it really means? [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3067.1800000000003s)]
*  It doesn't mean anything or is it just one of them names? [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3068.86s)]
*  AstraZeneca is a Greek Asteron meaning a star. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3074.38s)]
*  Zeneca is an invented name created by an agency instructed to find a name which began with [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3077.38s)]

*  Why would you do that? [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3099.5s)]
*  Just the way that you're creating this name, you don't want it to be offensive in any way [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3101.5800000000004s)]

*  There was a thing on the internet a while back about when they had that crazy campaign [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3112.02s)]
*  but Balenciaga as well. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3116.2200000000003s)]

*  Baal being the god of the Old Testament. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3121.82s)]
*  I didn't see that. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3124.94s)]
*  And then Balenciaga put together that crazy campaign where they spelled Balenciaga with [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3126.66s)]
*  two A's like Baal and then they had the kids in it. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3131.74s)]

*  long before the internet existed. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3152.46s)]
*  So they still behave in the same way. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3154.5s)]
*  It's like when politicians get caught saying things and they said, I've never said that [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3156.74s)]
*  and then they put this like whole long reel of them saying it over and over again. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3161.38s)]
*  It's because they forget. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3166.46s)]
*  They used to be able to just do that. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3167.46s)]
*  They used to be able to just bullshit and now there's too many internet sleuths that [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3169.02s)]
*  are out there just immediately pulling things up. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3173.46s)]

*  And then, you know, fucking everybody freaked out. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3187.22s)]
*  Why? [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3190.62s)]
*  Because he's really into it and he's uncovering and maybe he's wrong about some things. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3191.7s)]
*  But he does some crazy research. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3196.62s)]
*  Yeah, maybe he's right about things. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3198.14s)]
*  That's the problem. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3199.7799999999997s)]
*  It's not what he's wrong about. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3200.7799999999997s)]
*  That's the problem. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3201.98s)]
*  He opened my eyes to the, what does he call it? [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3202.98s)]
*  The mega corporation that owns everything. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3205.94s)]
*  He went through like all the different brands and the fact that it's basically Vanguard, [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3208.58s)]
*  State Street and BlackRock that own everything and then they own each other. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3211.82s)]
*  And he's got stuff on his website that shows if you're looking for a brand, who parent [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3216.7s)]
*  company is, who owns that company. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3222.54s)]
*  It all comes back to basically this conglomerate of BlackRock, State Street, Vanguard, JP Morgan [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3224.94s)]
*  and Fidelity, I think, are kind of the main four or five there. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3231.2599999999998s)]
*  What ever happened to like breaking up monopolies? [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3236.62s)]

*  They only did it back in the day with Rockefeller. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3239.8199999999997s)]
*  Well they did it with Microsoft, didn't they? [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3243.74s)]
*  Did they? [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3245.54s)]
*  Sure. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3246.54s)]
*  I think these companies are like the pharmaceutical companies. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3247.54s)]
*  They realize, like, what's the live nation? [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3249.86s)]
*  You know, like these huge monopolies that don't own everything, they're like, it's just [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3252.94s)]
*  an added cost. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3256.7s)]
*  You know, I'm going to sue it at some point for a billion and we're going to make $15 [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3260.58s)]
*  billion off it. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3263.62s)]
*  Right. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3264.62s)]
*  And then we're going to get our profit, so whatever, to drop in the bucket. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3265.66s)]
*  Well that's what happens when drugs get pulled. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3267.7799999999997s)]
*  And then people get sued. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3269.94s)]
*  Yeah, you've talked about it, Microsoft. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3270.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3271.94s)]
*  They never get… [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3272.94s)]
*  Bioxy. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3273.94s)]
*  Yeah, they never get fined more than they made. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3274.94s)]
*  Never. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3277.7s)]
*  Never. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3278.7s)]
*  It's always less than they made. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3279.7s)]
*  And the max is the perfect windfall because they have immunity. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3280.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3282.8599999999997s)]
*  They have the perfect immunity. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3283.8599999999997s)]
*  Well they're talking about pulling that and that's going to be the biggest fight. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3284.8599999999997s)]
*  That'll be the biggest fight. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3287.8599999999997s)]
*  Because there's still this narrative out there. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3288.8599999999997s)]
*  And when I had Suzanne Humphries on… [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3291.54s)]
*  First of all, that was one of the greatest. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3293.7799999999997s)]
*  And you got me onto her book. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3294.94s)]
*  Yes. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3296.26s)]
*  I read her book and then I read Bobby's book. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3297.26s)]
*  Her book's incredible. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3299.26s)]
*  Her book is unbelievable. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3300.26s)]
*  And no one can… [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3301.26s)]
*  No, and I gave that book to a lot of my friends who are of childbearing age and they're starting [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3302.26s)]
*  to have kids. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3309.2200000000003s)]
*  I'm not telling you what to do, but at least research this. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3310.2200000000003s)]
*  You have all the information. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3312.7000000000003s)]
*  Because they're not going to give you the information. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3314.9s)]
*  My friend just had a kid and got… [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3316.42s)]
*  Him and his wife got… [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3317.94s)]
*  I don't know what the right word is, but got kind of harassed for not jabbing up their [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3319.1s)]
*  kid on day one of her life. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3326.18s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3328.2200000000003s)]
*  Well, I experienced that when my kids were born. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3329.2200000000003s)]
*  They wanted you to dose them up. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3331.5s)]
*  And we were like, no. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3333.62s)]
*  No, we're waiting. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3334.62s)]
*  We're not doing anything for years. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3335.62s)]
*  We had a very good pediatrician though who wanted us to get the kids vaccinated but on [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3337.7000000000003s)]
*  a delayed schedule. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3342.5s)]
*  He didn't believe in doing it all at once. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3343.7000000000003s)]
*  I mean, it's like, you can't… [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3346.5s)]
*  You're not even supposed to eat sushi while you're breastfeeding. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3348.38s)]
*  You're not even supposed to eat sushi while you're pregnant because you could get some [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3351.58s)]
*  sort of a parasite. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3355.9s)]
*  And yet, you're going to take pregnant women and dose them up with this experimental vaccine, [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3356.9s)]
*  air quote vaccine, experimental medication, is gene editing… [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3362.42s)]
*  Well, they changed the definition of that. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3365.34s)]
*  They changed the definition. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3366.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3367.98s)]
*  But there was no studies on whether or not women were getting damaged by this. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3368.98s)]
*  No studies got released. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3372.9s)]
*  Right. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3374.62s)]
*  And now there's some study that it's destroying their eggs. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3376.42s)]
*  Yep. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3379.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3380.02s)]
*  Have you seen that? [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3381.02s)]
*  See if you can find that. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3382.02s)]
*  I bet you can't. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3383.02s)]
*  That, cancers. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3384.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3385.02s)]
*  See if you can find the eggs. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3386.02s)]
*  Turbo cancers. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3387.02s)]
*  I know I saved the egg thing. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3388.02s)]
*  I can definitely find that one. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3389.1s)]
*  People dropping, kids dropping. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3390.1s)]
*  Yeah, it's all very dark, dude. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3391.46s)]
*  It really is because the more you look, the more you find. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3393.74s)]
*  What about the nanobots? [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3397.38s)]
*  What about them? [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3400.1s)]
*  What are you thinking? [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3401.1s)]
*  Well, I've heard some rumblings that, you know, that was kind of like a fringe conspiracy [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3403.06s)]
*  theory that there was some nanobots particles that were in the vaccine. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3409.14s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not buying into that unless I see more because there was a lot of that. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3413.1s)]
*  People were saying, there's magnets in there. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3419.2999999999997s)]
*  Look, the metal sticks to your injection site. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3420.9s)]
*  Supposedly there's a frequency that brings the particles together. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3423.86s)]
*  Nanobots. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3426.98s)]
*  I haven't heard that. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3427.98s)]
*  Brings the particles together in the body and creates a, it's like a tracking device. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3429.38s)]
*  I just sent Jamie this study, VAERS adjusted data and other derived from the MIT Florida [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3433.86s)]
*  Department of Health study findings that yield a conservative range of 470,000 to 600,000 [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3441.78s)]
*  American deaths from the COVID-19 mRNA shots. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3449.46s)]
*  That's it? [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3453.78s)]
*  More than, well just that alone. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3454.78s)]
*  That's a lot of people, man. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3456.5s)]
*  More than World War I, World War II and Vietnam combined. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3458.38s)]
*  If that's true. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3461.58s)]
*  It indicates Pfizer, this is Pfizer alone, so this is not even Moderna. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3465.1s)]
*  Pfizer alone likely killed over 470,000 Americans. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3469.98s)]
*  They found a 36% increase in all-cause mortality among Pfizer recipients versus Moderna. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3473.5s)]
*  Yeah, but they saved millions. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3479.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I keep hearing that. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3481.6600000000003s)]
*  I think the saving millions thing is even based on the idea that you wouldn't get COVID [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3485.66s)]
*  if you got the vaccine, which turned out to not be true at all. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3491.7s)]
*  None of what they said turned out to be true. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3494.5s)]
*  No, no. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3496.02s)]
*  You can't get it, you can't spread it. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3497.02s)]
*  You're more protected, more robust immunity. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3499.02s)]
*  Yeah, what was I just going to look up? [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3502.02s)]
*  Winter of Death for the non-vaxxed. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3504.58s)]
*  Oh, that was a good one. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3506.66s)]
*  That was a good one. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3508.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, that's my favorite. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3509.2999999999997s)]
*  There's more studies coming out about myocarditis. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3511.3s)]
*  Who's going to be held accountable though? [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3518.3s)]
*  That's a good question. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3520.3s)]
*  Oh, here's the fertility study. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3521.3s)]
*  Who's going to apologize? [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3523.3s)]
*  I haven't heard any apologies, have you? [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3525.3s)]
*  Anybody apologize? [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3527.3s)]
*  CNN apologized to you yet, putting that filter on your face? [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3528.3s)]
*  No, it'd be nice. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3530.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3531.3s)]
*  They should probably apologize. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3532.3s)]
*  Get Sunjay, get Gupta back on here. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3533.3s)]
*  I'm sure he'll apologize. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3536.3s)]
*  No, I'd have him back on, I guess. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3537.3s)]
*  I don't know what we'd talk about. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3540.3s)]
*  There's only so much you can defend. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3542.3s)]
*  CNN Plus maybe? [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3544.3s)]
*  That was a fun trip. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3545.3s)]
*  That was only a few hundred million dollar failure. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3548.3s)]
*  Oops. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3551.3s)]
*  They've got to be doing a little better now that Trump's back in. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3552.3s)]
*  They've got something to talk about. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3555.3s)]
*  I don't think they are. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3556.3s)]
*  No? [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3557.3s)]
*  No, I think CNN's ratings are abysmal. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3558.3s)]
*  The only thing that saves them is that people just are consistent. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3561.3s)]
*  They just go on there out of habit. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3566.3s)]
*  I don't think people are seeking it out. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3568.3s)]
*  So this is fertility study. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3570.3s)]
*  A study of 1.3 million showed successful conceptions per 1,000 women were considerably lower for women who were COVID-19 mRNA vaccinated. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3573.3s)]
*  Preliminary results call for further studies of the potential influence of COVID-19 vaccination on human fertility. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3583.3s)]
*  And I think in that thread, they were talking about what it does to their eggs and ovaries. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3590.3s)]
*  Yeah, that's right there. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3598.3s)]
*  Yep. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3599.3s)]
*  This is what a lot of the conspiracy theorists were talking about when the vax was coming out. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3600.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3605.3s)]
*  Which, by the way, the conspiracy theorists are undefeated still. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3607.3s)]
*  Yeah, conspiracy theorists are way more accurate than CNN. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3610.3s)]
*  Way more. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3615.3s)]
*  Even if they got things wrong. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3616.3s)]
*  Like, let's say there's no nanobots in the shots. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3617.3s)]
*  But even whatever that, forget all that. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3619.3s)]
*  I think the nanobots in the shot would be too expensive. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3621.3s)]
*  That's why I think it's not real. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3624.3s)]
*  Yeah, I'm with you. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3625.3s)]
*  I mean, maybe a few people got it. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3626.3s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3628.3s)]
*  I still don't think Biden got it on TV. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3629.3s)]
*  I think they salined that dude. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3633.3s)]
*  I don't think they put a real COVID vaccine in him. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3635.3s)]
*  They didn't aspirate on any of the people on TV. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3638.3s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3642.3s)]
*  Or anybody I know that got the shot. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3643.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3645.3s)]
*  I asked everybody who got the shot, did they aspirate your needle? [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3646.3s)]
*  What do you mean? [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3648.3s)]
*  Well, in the syringe, when they plunge it in to make sure you're not in a blood vessel, [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3649.3s)]
*  they pull it back and they see if there's blood. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3653.3s)]
*  And if there's blood in it, they find a new injection site. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3655.3s)]
*  Did they do that? [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3658.3s)]
*  No. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3659.3s)]
*  They just plunged that motherfucker in. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3660.3s)]
*  Everybody just got plunged. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3662.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3664.3s)]
*  And then there was the idea that it was going to stay local. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3665.3s)]
*  Don't worry. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3667.3s)]
*  It'll stay local. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3668.3s)]
*  No. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3669.3s)]
*  Not only is it not staying local, your body's producing spike protein up to 700-plus days [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3670.3s)]
*  after the shot. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3674.3s)]
*  And some of the autopsies coming out, a little bit creepy. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3676.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3679.3s)]
*  Yeah, that's the other thing. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3680.3s)]
*  Not just autopsies, but coroners were finding these crazy clots. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3681.3s)]
*  That's what I mean, coroners, yeah. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3684.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3685.3s)]
*  These crazy fucking clots that look like big white worms that are inside people's bodies [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3686.3s)]
*  that they've never seen before. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3693.3s)]
*  I don't think that's ... Hold people accountable. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3695.3s)]
*  Where's the news? [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3697.3s)]
*  Hold them accountable. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3698.3s)]
*  Where's the news during their job? [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3699.3s)]
*  If the news was really the news, if you guys were really there to tell us all the information [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3702.3s)]
*  that we should be concerned about, perhaps we are wrong about what this shot does, and [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3709.3s)]
*  perhaps with some people, maybe where it did get into their bloodstream, which is what [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3715.3s)]
*  they think happened, was the people that they didn't aspirate, because they didn't aspirate [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3719.3s)]
*  anybody, they think some of those people went right into their bloodstream, and then your [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3722.3s)]
*  body's fighting, then it's off like it's an intruder, and that's where you get the [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3726.3s)]
*  And that's where you get the myocarditis and all sorts of other neurological conditions, [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3729.3s)]
*  and it's crazy. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3732.3s)]
*  We got to do a second shot, though, and then a third, and then a fourth. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3735.3s)]
*  And a knife. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3738.3s)]
*  And then, yeah. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3739.3s)]
*  There's people out there that took nine of those fucking things. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3740.3s)]
*  Hey, guess what? [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3742.3s)]
*  It's just like the flu shot. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3743.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3744.3s)]
*  They get you for one strand of the flu per season. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3745.3s)]
*  Not only that, it makes you 25% more likely to get sick with something else. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3749.3s)]
*  But you're way more protected. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3753.3s)]
*  I've never had one. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3755.3s)]
*  I mean, I think maybe I had one once. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3756.3s)]
*  Maybe somebody made me get one once. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3757.3s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3759.3s)]
*  But I never get the fucking flu shot. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3760.3s)]
*  And people are like, I get the flu shot every year, and I've never got the flu. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3762.3s)]
*  Well, bitch, I don't get the flu either. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3765.3s)]
*  Like, what are you saying? [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3766.3s)]
*  Like, I got the flu like once, and like a couple years ago for like a day or two days. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3768.3s)]
*  I got a couple of vitamin IVs, and I was good to go. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3773.3s)]
*  Like, this idea that you have to get this fucking shot, or you're going to get the flu, [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3776.3s)]
*  and if you get the flu, you're going to die. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3779.3s)]
*  That's a lemming effect. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3781.3s)]
*  That's a lemming effect. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3782.3s)]
*  That's a lemming effect. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3783.3s)]
*  You just, I got to do this because everybody else is doing it. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3784.3s)]
*  If I don't do it, I'm outside the herd. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3786.3s)]
*  If I'm outside the herd, I'm outside of, you know, my livelihood. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3787.3s)]
*  Well, it's also you don't want to get the flu. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3790.3s)]
*  The flu sucks. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3791.3s)]
*  You don't want to be laid up in bed out of work for a week. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3792.3s)]
*  Yeah, but the best immunity is natural immunity. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3794.3s)]
*  Contraction and beating anything. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3796.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3797.3s)]
*  Just about. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3798.3s)]
*  Which is probably why I don't have the flu. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3799.3s)]
*  Well, maybe diet has something to do with it, too. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3801.3s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of things have to do with it. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3804.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3806.3s)]
*  You don't eat like shit. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3807.3s)]
*  Maybe take some vitamins. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3808.3s)]
*  That's a factor. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3809.3s)]
*  No. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3810.3s)]
*  Mr. Hotez. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3811.3s)]
*  What you need is a balanced diet of cheeseburgers. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3812.3s)]
*  Yeah, that was a crazy one, the Hotez one. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3815.3s)]
*  That was a great one. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3818.3s)]
*  Looking at an overweight guy who's clearly unhealthy, telling you the only way to get [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3819.3s)]
*  healthy is an injection. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3823.3s)]
*  No, don't take any vitamins. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3824.3s)]
*  Really? [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3825.3s)]
*  Doesn't exercise, doesn't take vitamins, eats junk food like, huh. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3826.3s)]
*  Okay. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3829.3s)]
*  Huh. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3830.3s)]
*  And I'm listening to you, why? [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3831.3s)]
*  And those are the people prescribing, going to college to be a doctor, prescribing drugs. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3832.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3837.3s)]
*  That's really what it boils down to. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3838.3s)]
*  They hook you, they deal with symptoms, they keep you a patient for life. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3840.3s)]
*  Uh-huh, yeah. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3843.3s)]
*  And it's immensely profitable. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3844.3s)]
*  And anybody trying to actually heal people and treat the patient. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3845.3s)]
*  Yeah, you're a kook. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3849.3s)]
*  You're a kook. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3851.3s)]
*  Naturopath kook. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3852.3s)]
*  What are you saying? [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3853.3s)]
*  Vitamin C. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3854.3s)]
*  Fucking hippie. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3855.3s)]

*  Jesus Christ. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3857.3s)]
*  The really crazy thing from the Suzanne Humphrey's book that got me was the connection between [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3858.3s)]
*  DDT and polio, what we call polio. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3863.3s)]
*  How about how they change, just like the Vax? [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3865.3s)]
*  They change the definition of polio. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3867.3s)]
*  Right. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3869.3s)]
*  Once the vaccine was introduced, they completely changed the definition of polio to show this [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3870.3s)]
*  immense drop off of polio. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3874.3s)]
*  Look at this. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3875.3s)]
*  It doesn't exist anymore. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3876.3s)]
*  It's like, yeah. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3877.3s)]
*  Really? [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3878.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3879.3s)]
*  Meanwhile, all the other things that could be what people were experiencing symptoms [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3880.3s)]
*  of, all still existed. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3886.3s)]
*  And most of the disease is cleared up from sanitation, clean air, clean water, proper [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3888.3s)]
*  sewage. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3893.3s)]
*  Yes. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3894.3s)]
*  Well, when you get the charge of like when sanitation was introduced, everything goes [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3895.3s)]
*  away. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3898.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3899.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3900.3s)]
*  We were living in squalor and filth. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3901.3s)]
*  Human beings were living in outhouses all throughout New York City. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3902.3s)]
*  No ventilation. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3905.3s)]
*  People were no nutrition, no food. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3906.3s)]
*  People were starving to death. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3909.3s)]
*  They were working horrible hours. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3911.3s)]
*  And of course, everybody was sick as fuck. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3913.3s)]
*  One of my favorite parts about the book was there was during the cowpox epidemic where [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3915.3s)]
*  they were like cutting people's skin and putting like posse disease into it as the [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3919.3s)]
*  vaccination. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3926.3s)]
*  And there was a county in England, I believe, that wasn't doing any of that stuff. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3927.3s)]
*  And it was the only county that had zero cases or next to zero cases of cowpox in the [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3931.3s)]
*  area. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3937.3s)]
*  And the other counties just hated them because they were the anti-establishment, non-vaccinated [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3938.3s)]
*  people. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3944.3s)]
*  And it's like, what happened today? [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3945.3s)]
*  Like, look at how come we haven't studied the Amish? [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3947.3s)]
*  Like there's been a few studies. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3950.3s)]
*  Right. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3951.3s)]
*  Why do the Amish, you know, live longer lives, are healthier? [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3952.3s)]
*  They don't have any SIDS. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3956.3s)]
*  No autism either. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3958.3s)]
*  No autism. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3959.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3960.3s)]
*  That's the SIDS thing's the scariest one. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3961.3s)]
*  Because there's people saying that what SIDS is, is these children dying from vaccines. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3963.3s)]
*  And that, oh, your kid just died suddenly. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3969.3s)]
*  Well, who knows what happened? [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3972.3s)]
*  Well, did anything happen before that? [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3974.3s)]
*  Did you like maybe inject them with a bunch of chemicals? [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3975.3s)]
*  In the last couple of weeks? [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3978.3s)]
*  Was hepatitis B for a fucking baby? [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3979.3s)]
*  Did that go down? [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3981.3s)]
*  You know, what happened? [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3982.3s)]
*  But nobody wants to say it because nobody wants to be responsible for their child dying [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3984.3s)]
*  because they let that happen. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3987.3s)]
*  And instead of going, that's interesting, they go, oh, you're a fucking anti-vaxxer. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3989.3s)]
*  You're this, you're that, you're anti-science. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3993.3s)]
*  It's like the content of what I'm saying is doesn't it fucking piss you off that SIDS [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3995.3s)]
*  even exists in the first place and you just put in this blanket made up, you know, made [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=3999.3s)]
*  up, I don't know what the right word is, to label, label. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4005.3s)]
*  Oh, it's a sudden infant death syndrome. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4008.3s)]
*  We don't know what it is. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4010.3s)]
*  It just happened suddenly and it happened to an infant and they died. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4011.3s)]
*  Wouldn't you want to figure out what the fuck caused this instead of just like, oh, well, [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4014.3s)]
*  we don't know. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4018.3s)]
*  It's just, there's just a small percentage that it just happens to. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4019.3s)]
*  Well, what happened to the baby in the first, you know, right before, the day before? [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4022.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4026.3s)]
*  Two days before, a week before, two weeks before? [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4027.3s)]
*  The Amish and the autism thing is really nuts. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4029.3s)]
*  They don't find any autism. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4031.3s)]
*  They found, in the study I read, they found two cases of autism in this Amish population [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4032.3s)]
*  and both were adopted kids. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4037.3s)]
*  Jeez. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4039.3s)]
*  Who had been vaccinated. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4040.3s)]
*  That is so wild. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4041.3s)]
*  That's so wild. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4043.3s)]
*  It's like the overall implications are so large that people don't even want to consider [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4045.3s)]
*  the possibility of it. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4050.3s)]
*  They'd rather keep the blinders on. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4051.3s)]
*  But they. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4053.3s)]
*  It's like what Carl Sagan about, said about people being bamboozled, that it's easier [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4054.3s)]
*  to bamboozle people than to trick them. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4059.3s)]
*  It's easier to trick them than to convince them that they've been tricked. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4062.3s)]
*  Because they don't want to believe it. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4066.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4067.3s)]
*  And that's what you see. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4068.3s)]
*  People are like, you start talking to them about the possibility that these things caused [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4069.3s)]
*  all these problems and their eyes glaze over. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4075.3s)]
*  They're like, oh, where are you hearing this? [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4078.3s)]
*  Where are you hearing that that's not the case? [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4081.3s)]
*  Why are you so confident to say that this is what happened? [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4083.3s)]
*  People just like blank, the COVID vaccine saved millions of lives. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4087.3s)]
*  Millions. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4091.3s)]
*  Like, how do you know that? [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4092.3s)]
*  How do you know that? [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4093.3s)]
*  How many do you think got fucked up by it? [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4094.3s)]
*  I know a lot of people that got fucked up by it. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4096.3s)]
*  And most people do, too. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4098.3s)]
*  And they don't want to admit it. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4100.3s)]
*  Well, it's not correlation. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4101.3s)]
*  Causation is not correlated. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4102.3s)]
*  They want to pretend. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4104.3s)]
*  Why are they trying to scare the shit out of everybody? [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4107.3s)]
*  Tell me that. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4110.3s)]
*  Why do they have fucking debt tolls on the news stations? [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4111.3s)]
*  Make a lot of money. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4114.3s)]
*  And that's with vaccines. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4116.3s)]
*  Same thing. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4117.3s)]
*  There's a ton of money. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4118.3s)]
*  Doctors get huge bonuses for fully vaccinated kids. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4119.3s)]
*  That's the truth. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4121.3s)]
*  Isn't that? [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4122.3s)]
*  I mean, like, instead of attacking the person that says that, isn't it something you should [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4123.3s)]
*  look into? [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4128.3s)]
*  Right. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4129.3s)]
*  Is that a conflict of interest? [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4130.3s)]
*  It seems like it is. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4131.3s)]
*  Should be. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4132.3s)]
*  Yeah, it seems like it is. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4133.3s)]
*  Let me try one of those. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4134.3s)]
*  Get in there, dog. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4135.3s)]
*  You're not going to try two. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4136.3s)]
*  You want two at least. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4137.3s)]
*  Come on, get a couple more, man. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4138.3s)]
*  You're going to run dry. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4139.3s)]
*  My friend, Brendan Chaube, he had like four sixes in his mouth. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4140.3s)]
*  I'm like, what are you doing? [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4149.3s)]
*  You have four in your mouth? [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4151.3s)]
*  I was like, dude, I love them. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4152.3s)]
*  Four. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4153.3s)]
*  At any given time, I got four in there. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4154.3s)]
*  They have one, I think, called the Pablo. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4155.3s)]
*  Is that what it's called? [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4156.3s)]
*  I think it has 30 milligrams. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4157.3s)]
*  Like, I try, I put it in my mouth for a second. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4158.3s)]
*  I was like, I can't do this. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4159.3s)]
*  Good one, yeah. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4160.3s)]
*  I can't handle this. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4161.3s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4162.3s)]
*  50. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4163.3s)]
*  Oh my God, that's so crazy. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4164.3s)]
*  That's so much nicotine. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4165.3s)]
*  You're supposed to have like, 30, 40, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4166.3s)]
*  50. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4167.3s)]
*  You're supposed to have like six milligrams a day for the benefits that they talk about. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4168.3s)]
*  Six? [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4185.02s)]
*  That's it? [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4186.02s)]
*  I think that's it. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4187.02s)]
*  I think that's all you need. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4188.02s)]
*  And the benefits increase the more you take? [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4189.02s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4190.02s)]
*  We'll find out. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4191.02s)]
*  Imagine if like they do a study on all these guys that were using tobacco pouches all day [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4192.02s)]
*  Like Shane Gillis, he fucking swaps a new one out every five minutes all day long. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4197.66s)]
*  He's just popping sixes. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4202.179999999999s)]
*  Real American right there. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4203.54s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4206.54s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4207.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4208.54s)]
*  It's a weird, I thought they were super addictive so I quit for a few days. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4209.54s)]
*  It was fine. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4214.58s)]
*  It was nothing. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4215.58s)]
*  I felt nothing. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4216.58s)]
*  I think you have a stronger will than most people though. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4217.58s)]
*  Yeah, but I didn't even get a headache. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4220.58s)]
*  Like when I quit coffee, I get a headache. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4221.58s)]
*  Really? [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4223.58s)]
*  Yeah, I quit coffee a couple of times for a day or two. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4224.58s)]
*  Just for fun to see what happens. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4227.02s)]
*  I'm like, oh, I feel like shit. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4228.02s)]
*  I'm 100% addicted to coffee, but I could quit it. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4232.02s)]
*  I would feel like shit for a couple of days and I would just figure out what to take so [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4236.5s)]
*  I don't feel like shit. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4240.26s)]
*  Sugar, I think, is the biggest addictive substance. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4241.26s)]
*  You cut sugar out. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4244.26s)]
*  You do like a whole 30 or whatever. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4245.26s)]
*  They freak out. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4248.1s)]
*  Yeah, well, that's another thing that freaks out when people start trying ketogenic diets. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4249.1s)]
*  They get the keto flu, they call it. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4253.3s)]
*  Your body's like, where's the sugar? [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4255.58s)]
*  And then there's also the problem that a lot of the sugar that we're getting is corn syrup. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4258.58s)]
*  And corn syrup is sort of a manufactured sugar. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4263.58s)]
*  So your body, there's an extra step your body has to take to process it. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4267.58s)]
*  Like people want to say, oh, well, it's chemically the same as it is from fruit or cane sugar. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4271.58s)]
*  No, it's not. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4276.58s)]
*  It's not. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4277.58s)]
*  No, no. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4278.58s)]
*  The science shows that that is not the case. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4279.58s)]
*  Not only that. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4282.58s)]
*  Anthony Fauci? [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4283.58s)]
*  I'm not that guy. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4284.62s)]
*  OK. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4285.62s)]
*  If you criticize Anthony Fauci, you're criticizing science. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4286.62s)]
*  OK. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4289.62s)]
*  What about those fucking AIDS vaccines you gave foster kids, you piece of shit? [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4290.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4294.62s)]
*  In the 1980s where they died. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4295.62s)]
*  What about the polio vaccines your best buddy gave in India and maimed and paralyzed a bunch [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4296.62s)]
*  of kids? [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4301.62s)]
*  How about that? [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4302.62s)]
*  Most of the polio was from vaccines. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4303.62s)]
*  This is like modern polio. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4305.62s)]
*  There's a large percentage of modern polio that is vaccine-derived. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4307.62s)]
*  The majority, Suzanne says. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4311.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4312.66s)]
*  You tell that to people and they go, what? [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4313.66s)]
*  No. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4315.66s)]
*  My favorite one is when people get nutty about all this stuff. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4316.66s)]
*  What about polio? [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4319.66s)]
*  If they didn't have the polio vaccine, I go, Jonas Salk. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4320.66s)]
*  What percentage of polio do you think is asymptomatic? [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4323.66s)]
*  Meaning you have polio, but you have no symptoms at all. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4326.66s)]
*  And they're like, oh, probably none. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4329.66s)]
*  None. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4332.66s)]
*  95 to 99 percent. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4333.66s)]
*  You say that and they're like, what? [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4334.66s)]
*  And then you Google it and you see it right in front of your face. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4336.66s)]
*  And people just go, what the fuck is going on here? [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4339.66s)]
*  What is that? [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4341.7s)]
*  And then Suzanne Humphreys, when she connects DDT, where the first cases of polio were from [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4342.7s)]
*  rural communities where they were spraying DDT on all the crops. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4347.7s)]
*  They were spraying DDT everywhere. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4351.7s)]
*  No one knew that DDT was so bad for you. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4352.7s)]
*  They were spraying it everywhere. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4354.7s)]
*  And not just people were getting polio. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4356.7s)]
*  Dogs, horses, cows. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4358.7s)]
*  It was like animals were getting the same symptoms. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4361.7s)]
*  And polio is not cross-pollinating. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4363.7s)]
*  It doesn't go to these other species. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4366.7s)]
*  It doesn't jump species. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4369.7s)]
*  It was DDT poisoning. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4370.74s)]
*  That's coincidence. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4371.74s)]
*  It's wild. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4373.74s)]
*  You tell that to people and their eyes glaze over. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4374.74s)]
*  And I get it. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4375.74s)]
*  I get it. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4376.74s)]
*  I've been there before. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4377.74s)]
*  It's like it's too much. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4378.74s)]
*  It's too much to admit, as Carl Sagan says, the bamboozle. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4380.74s)]
*  Why though? [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4384.74s)]
*  Why can't we just be common sense? [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4385.74s)]
*  Like, that's what I was thinking the other day. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4387.74s)]
*  I was like, I don't want any shit in my water. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4388.74s)]
*  Let's take out the fluoride. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4392.74s)]
*  Let's take out the chemicals in our water. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4393.74s)]
*  In our food, can we take out artificial dyes? [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4396.74s)]
*  Is it too hard to have artificial dyes? [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4398.74s)]
*  Is it too hard to have the same food, US manufacturers, [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4399.78s)]
*  that you put in the food in Europe that doesn't have the dyes in it? [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4403.78s)]
*  That doesn't have the bullshit? [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4407.78s)]
*  From the same company. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4408.78s)]
*  That has 20 less ingredients. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4409.78s)]
*  The same shit for us. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4410.78s)]
*  Yeah, the same company. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4412.78s)]
*  No one's saying, don't give us Froot Loops. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4414.78s)]
*  I want Froot Loops. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4416.78s)]
*  Just give me Froot Loops that don't give me cancer. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4418.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4420.78s)]
*  You can do that. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4421.78s)]
*  It's still bad for you. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4422.78s)]
*  But so what? [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4423.78s)]
*  It's less bad for you. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4424.78s)]
*  Wouldn't that be better? [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4425.78s)]
*  Like, oh, it doesn't look as pretty? [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4426.78s)]
*  What? [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4428.82s)]
*  Once the milk gets in there and everything gets crazy, [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4429.82s)]
*  who gives a fuck? [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4431.82s)]
*  You know, no little kids are looking at that going, [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4432.82s)]
*  I don't like this as much. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4434.82s)]
*  The colors are dull. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4435.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4436.82s)]
*  No, they're going to eat the Froot Loops. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4437.82s)]
*  But is it too much to just want to have, like, common sense shit? [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4439.82s)]
*  Your vaccines, can we get them just double-blind, [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4442.82s)]
*  CBO-tested, safety-tested vaccines? [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4444.82s)]
*  Well, they're going to do that now. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4447.82s)]
*  And this is another one that Bobby's done. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4448.82s)]
*  Are they? [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4449.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4450.82s)]
*  Come on, Bobby. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4451.82s)]
*  The other thing that Bobby did, did you see that conversation [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4452.82s)]
*  that he had with the dentist about fluoride? [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4453.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4455.82s)]
*  Where the dentist was questioning about fluoride. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4456.82s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I have a lot more dental surgeries. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4457.86s)]
*  And then Bobby hits him with the stats about, like, [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4460.86s)]
*  you don't need that in the water. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4463.86s)]
*  You could use, if fluoride is so effective, [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4465.86s)]
*  you use it orally, like toothpaste and mouthwash, [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4467.86s)]
*  and you spit it out. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4470.86s)]
*  You don't have to swallow it and take it into your mouth. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4471.86s)]
*  And you probably shouldn't even do that. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4473.86s)]
*  I don't use fluoride toothpaste. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4474.86s)]
*  No. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4476.86s)]
*  Eddie Bravo had a great point. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4477.86s)]
*  He's like, if fluoride did so much, [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4478.86s)]
*  why would they specifically advertise toothpaste [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4480.86s)]
*  as not having fluoride? [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4483.86s)]
*  Fluoride-free toothpaste. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4485.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4487.9s)]
*  Which is true. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4488.9s)]
*  That's what I use. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4489.9s)]
*  I don't have any cavities. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4490.9s)]
*  I haven't had cavities in fucking ever. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4491.9s)]
*  I can't remember. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4493.9s)]
*  But there's some other ways to avoid cavities, too. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4494.9s)]
*  You know, like do oil pulling. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4497.9s)]
*  Just swish some coconut oil around your mouth. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4499.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4501.9s)]
*  Add some baking soda if you want to it. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4502.9s)]
*  Do you know that's the... [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4504.9s)]
*  Somebody was talking about this recently [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4505.9s)]
*  about the myth around root canals. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4506.9s)]
*  Oh, the thing... [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4511.9s)]
*  And the danger of root canals. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4512.9s)]
*  Yeah, the root canals can possibly leave bacteria [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4513.94s)]
*  under the skin. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4516.94s)]
*  Parasites. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4517.94s)]
*  Yeah, it's really bad for you. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4518.94s)]
*  If you have a root canal, I do. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4519.94s)]
*  I'm getting mine taken out. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4520.94s)]
*  What are they going to... [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4521.94s)]
*  Are you going to put a drill hole in there, [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4522.94s)]
*  a post, and get a new tooth, [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4523.94s)]
*  or are you just going to go toothless? [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4524.94s)]
*  New tooth, I think. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4525.94s)]
*  New tooth. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4526.94s)]
*  Yeah, it'd be kind of cool [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4527.94s)]
*  if I was a hockey player maybe. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4528.94s)]
*  Maybe I'd get a gold tooth like a rapper. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4529.94s)]
*  Let's go. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4531.94s)]
*  Platinum. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4532.94s)]
*  Diamond. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4533.94s)]
*  I have a couple of diamonds in my teeth. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4534.94s)]

*  All diamonds. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4541.94s)]
*  Big UFC coming up. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4542.98s)]
*  Yes. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4543.98s)]

*  That's an interesting fight. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4548.98s)]
*  Very interesting fight. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4549.98s)]
*  I do not know how Sugar Sean keeps that guy off of him, [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4550.98s)]
*  but I do like what he's been doing. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4554.98s)]
*  Got off social media, stopped smoking weed, [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4556.98s)]
*  just dialed the fuck in. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4559.98s)]
*  Got his hip fixed, which was a big problem. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4560.98s)]
*  There's a lot of these fighters that take these fights [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4563.98s)]
*  because it's a lot of money and it's a big event [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4566.98s)]
*  and they don't want to cancel [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4569.98s)]
*  and they got a significant injury. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4571.0199999999995s)]
*  Sean could not wrestle. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4573.0199999999995s)]
*  Imagine not being able to wrestle in camp [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4574.0199999999995s)]
*  and you got to go face Marab. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4577.0199999999995s)]
*  Who's getting you on the ground? [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4579.0199999999995s)]
*  He's a fucking animal. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4581.0199999999995s)]
*  That guy's superhuman. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4583.0199999999995s)]
*  There's no one like him. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4584.0199999999995s)]
*  The cardio that guy has is off the charts. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4586.0199999999995s)]
*  It's just off the charts. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4589.0199999999995s)]
*  I've never seen anything like it. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4590.0199999999995s)]
*  He doesn't get tired. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4592.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4593.0199999999995s)]
*  And he's full gas, no breaks, the entire fight. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4594.0199999999995s)]
*  It's just smothering. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4598.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4599.0199999999995s)]
*  Overwhelming people. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4600.06s)]
*  Even Nurmica Medoff, who's also an animal, [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4601.06s)]
*  he couldn't keep him off of them. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4604.06s)]
*  This motherfucker's crazy. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4606.06s)]
*  And then when DC went to visit him on Sunday, [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4609.06s)]
*  the day after the fight, he was out running. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4611.06s)]
*  What? [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4613.06s)]
*  Yep. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4614.06s)]
*  DC went to his house to congratulate him [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4615.06s)]
*  and DC made a video of it [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4617.06s)]
*  because he showed a video of Marab's gym. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4619.06s)]
*  He's got this gym in his garage, pretty dope. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4621.06s)]
*  And he's like, this motherfucker's out running. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4623.06s)]
*  He just won the world title and the next day he's running. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4626.06s)]
*  He's an animal, man. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4629.1s)]
*  He's a fucking animal. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4631.1s)]
*  I was sad to not see you in Montreal. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4633.1s)]
*  Yeah, I haven't been going to Canada lately. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4635.1s)]

*  It's a good city. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4644.1s)]
*  I love Montreal. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4645.1s)]
*  One of my favorite restaurants, Joe Beef, is in Montreal. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4646.1s)]

*  It's fucking phenomenal. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4650.1s)]
*  I'll drop you in. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4651.1s)]
*  Incredible place. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4652.1s)]
*  Incredible place. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4653.1s)]
*  They'll let you in. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4654.1s)]
*  But there's... [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4655.1s)]
*  The culture in Montreal is amazing. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4656.1s)]
*  I've always loved it. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4658.14s)]
*  I've been going to Montreal since the 90s. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4659.14s)]

*  I love the people. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4665.14s)]
*  I just think they're going down a dark road with this government. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4666.14s)]
*  And it's hard to pull that stuff back. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4669.14s)]
*  Once they start taking away rules or instituting laws, [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4672.14s)]
*  taking away rights, pulling people's guns, [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4676.14s)]
*  doing all the things they're doing right now, [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4679.14s)]
*  they allow polygamy now in Ontario. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4681.14s)]
*  Do they? [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4683.14s)]
*  Yeah, they just passed a law. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4684.14s)]
*  They allow polygamy because they have so many Muslims there. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4685.14s)]
*  Are we sure we want them as a 51st state? [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4687.18s)]
*  Yeah, we can clear it up. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4689.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4691.18s)]
*  It's never going to happen. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4692.18s)]
*  He was just trying to fuck with them, [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4694.18s)]
*  and it had the worst effect possible [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4696.18s)]
*  because they thought that Pierre and the Conservatives were eschewing. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4699.18s)]
*  It was going to be... [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4703.18s)]
*  Jordan, the way he described it, [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4705.18s)]
*  he said they were in a position where the Liberal Party [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4707.18s)]
*  had a real risk of complete collapse. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4710.18s)]
*  And then Trump comes along. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4712.18s)]
*  I'm going to turn into the 51st state. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4714.18s)]
*  I was on the phone with him and he was telling me, [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4716.22s)]
*  he's like, I kept calling him Governor Trudeau. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4718.22s)]
*  And he goes, first of all, [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4720.22s)]
*  I was joking about turning into a 51st state, [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4722.22s)]
*  but then a lot of people go, it's actually a good idea. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4724.22s)]
*  I think it might be a good idea. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4726.22s)]
*  It's so crazy. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4728.22s)]
*  But that had the worst possible effect [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4732.22s)]
*  because then Canada united, [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4734.22s)]
*  like, hey, these fucking Americans [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4736.22s)]
*  think they're going to take over us, eh? [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4738.22s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4740.22s)]
*  Yeah, it became a disaster for Canada, unfortunately. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4741.22s)]
*  Because if he didn't say that, Pierre would have probably won. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4745.26s)]
*  Is this guy worse than Trudeau? Is that possible? [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4748.26s)]
*  That's what Jordan believes. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4750.26s)]
*  Really? [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4752.26s)]
*  Jordan believes he's worse than Trudeau. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4753.26s)]
*  Jordan thinks he embodies all the worst aspects [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4755.26s)]
*  of the World Economic Forum, [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4758.26s)]
*  young global leaders' mentality of control, [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4760.26s)]
*  and some of the things that he said about every decision [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4763.26s)]
*  will be made with climate change in mind, [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4765.26s)]
*  like that kind of talk. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4767.26s)]
*  This idea of climate change, yes, yes, sure, [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4769.26s)]
*  we should definitely clean up the environment, of course. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4771.26s)]
*  But understand that there's no thing they do ever [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4773.3s)]
*  that's completely benevolent. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4776.3s)]
*  It's not happening. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4778.3s)]
*  Everything they do is about power and money. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4780.3s)]
*  And so if they're pushing global health [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4783.3s)]
*  or if they're pushing climate control or climate change, [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4786.3s)]
*  it is about power and money. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4791.3s)]
*  It's a restriction of rights coming, for sure. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4793.3s)]
*  And they just do it in a way where it's kind of undeniable [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4795.3s)]
*  because the future of our world, [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4797.3s)]
*  the future of our world is going to be a lot more complicated [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4800.3s)]
*  because the future of our world, [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4802.34s)]
*  the future of your children, [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4804.34s)]
*  meanwhile Canada's just pumping coal [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4806.34s)]
*  like a fucking semi on the highway, [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4808.34s)]
*  just bah, bah. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4810.34s)]
*  They're just fucking making coal power plants. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4812.34s)]
*  They're like, look at these idiots. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4815.34s)]
*  We are just going to make as much electricity as possible [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4817.34s)]
*  because we're in a fucking technology AI race [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4819.34s)]
*  with these assholes. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4821.34s)]
*  And then they found out that China has been sneaking in [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4823.34s)]
*  all of these listening devices [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4827.34s)]
*  that they sold us. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4830.38s)]
*  What about the Transformers? [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4831.38s)]
*  Yeah, the Transformers. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4833.38s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of different things. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4834.38s)]
*  Yeah, Chinese solar power inverters. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4836.38s)]
*  This is what it is. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4839.38s)]
*  I'll show it to you, Jamie, [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4840.38s)]
*  if you can't pull it up in time. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4841.38s)]
*  It's a race to see who gets it first, Jamie or me. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4842.38s)]
*  I can see it already. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4845.38s)]
*  You got it, bitch. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4847.38s)]
*  Here it is. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4848.38s)]
*  He's always quicker than me. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4849.38s)]
*  And he's only typing one here, which is even crazier. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4851.38s)]
*  That's impressive, Jamie. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4854.38s)]
*  But so they found out that they're calling it a ghost [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4855.38s)]
*  in the machine. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4858.38s)]
*  There's these rogue communications devices [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4859.42s)]
*  found in Chinese solar power inverters. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4861.42s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4864.42s)]
*  We're stupid and we take their stuff because it's cheaper [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4865.42s)]
*  and there's no limitations on these foreign countries [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4868.42s)]
*  buying up land in America [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4872.42s)]
*  where you can't buy any fucking land in China. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4874.42s)]
*  You can't own a company in China. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4876.42s)]
*  You can't buy land in China. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4878.42s)]
*  They're smart about it. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4880.42s)]
*  We're stupid about it. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4881.42s)]
*  We've got another China virus, huh? [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4882.42s)]
*  So rogue communication devices not listed in product documents [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4884.42s)]
*  have been found in some Chinese solar power inverters [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4887.46s)]
*  by US experts who stripped down equipment [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4890.46s)]
*  hooked up to grids to check for security issues. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4892.46s)]
*  Two people said. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4895.46s)]
*  Over the past nine months, [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4896.46s)]
*  undocumented communication devices, [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4897.46s)]
*  including cellular radios, [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4899.46s)]
*  have also been found in some batteries [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4901.46s)]
*  from multiple Chinese suppliers. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4903.46s)]
*  Cellular radios in batteries. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4906.46s)]
*  I mean, this is the ultimate Trojan horse. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4909.46s)]
*  I mean, props to China. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4913.46s)]
*  They're so clever. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4915.46s)]
*  They knew we're dumb and they know we're greedy. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4916.5s)]
*  So we want like cheaper stuff. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4918.5s)]
*  Why don't we just shut this shit down? [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4919.5s)]
*  Because we can't make these things. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4921.5s)]
*  This is what Trump is trying to encourage. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4923.5s)]
*  Like, you know, we talk. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4925.5s)]
*  I talked to Tim Cook. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4926.5s)]
*  Tim, you don't want to be opening up a plant in India. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4927.5s)]
*  I don't like it. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4930.5s)]
*  And people's like, that sounds like fascism. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4931.5s)]
*  No, it sounds like someone's concerned about national security. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4933.5s)]
*  Like maybe we shouldn't have like, who knows what's in this? [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4936.5s)]
*  Who knows what's in this? [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4939.5s)]
*  I never looked. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4940.5s)]
*  I've never looked in this. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4941.5s)]
*  I don't look. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4942.5s)]
*  And most of these are made in China or India. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4943.54s)]
*  Right. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4946.54s)]
*  Why don't they make them here so we know that it's just the CIA spying on us? [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4947.54s)]
*  No, they couldn't be doing that. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4955.54s)]
*  They're benevolent. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4956.54s)]
*  My favorite one is these phones that can't be hacked. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4957.54s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4961.54s)]
*  Because I asked a legitimate security expert to do a deep dive on this. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4962.54s)]
*  And he sent me an actual PDF. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4967.54s)]
*  Like he laid out all he like literally went through it. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4969.54s)]
*  He's like, I can get in all these. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4972.58s)]
*  Everybody can get if I and he's like, if wasn't Elon going to make one. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4974.58s)]
*  He's talked about it, but he's a hope I don't have to make a phone. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4978.58s)]
*  That's what he says. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4982.58s)]
*  I hope I don't have to do that. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4983.58s)]
*  But if they get in his iPhone and plug in, text get leaked and that kind of shit happens. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4984.58s)]
*  Maybe he will. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4990.58s)]
*  I was watching Kill Tony. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4991.58s)]
*  Who's the comic who played Elon? [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4993.58s)]
*  Kyle Dunnigan. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4997.58s)]
*  He's the best. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4998.58s)]
*  He's hilarious. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=4999.58s)]
*  He's so funny, dude. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5000.58s)]
*  He's so funny. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5001.62s)]
*  Have you ever seen his Instagram? [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5002.62s)]
*  No. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5003.62s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5004.62s)]
*  He does these face swap videos with like Trump and Stormy Daniels and the Kardashians. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5005.62s)]
*  Stormy! [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5011.62s)]
*  He's so funny, man. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5013.62s)]
*  He's so funny. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5016.62s)]
*  He's such a wild dude. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5017.62s)]
*  Kyle is like the most underappreciated guy out there, I believe. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5019.62s)]
*  I really do. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5022.62s)]
*  In terms of like all out funny, his stuff is so ridiculous. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5023.66s)]
*  Comedy, I feel like, is kind of in a better place. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5032.66s)]
*  Is in a better place. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5034.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5035.66s)]
*  I think a big turning point was the Tom Brady roast. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5036.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5038.66s)]
*  I think that was because it was the biggest thing ever on Netflix. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5039.66s)]
*  More people watch the Tom Brady roast on Netflix, which is wild comedy. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5043.66s)]
*  Tony Hinchcliffe, Andrew Schultz. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5047.66s)]
*  Tony was unbelievable. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5049.66s)]
*  On fire. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5050.66s)]
*  On fire. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5051.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5052.7s)]
*  I mean, he took that super seriously. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5053.7s)]
*  And, you know, I actually got a hold of Tom to get him on the roast. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5055.7s)]
*  Really? [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5060.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5061.7s)]
*  I'm like, you got to get Tony Hinchcliffe. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5062.7s)]
*  They're doing a roast on you. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5063.7s)]
*  He's the best roaster alive. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5064.7s)]
*  No, no exaggeration. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5066.7s)]
*  So you think after that, just more stuff was on the table or people were more? [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5068.7s)]
*  Netflix was all of a sudden like wide open. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5072.7s)]
*  They were completely open to do wild stuff now because they're like, look, fuck all this [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5075.7s)]
*  woke shit. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5080.74s)]
*  This is not profitable. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5081.74s)]
*  Not only is it not profitable, like we're actually killing the business and you're killing [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5082.74s)]
*  the business of comedy because people watch these specials and like, what is this? [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5086.74s)]
*  Like you made a DEI comedy special or, you know, an inclusive comedy special where you [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5090.74s)]
*  are letting people do comedy in the biggest form in the world just because they fit this [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5096.74s)]
*  particular group of people, this particular political group. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5102.74s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5106.74s)]
*  It's identity politics in the worst way possible because it's counterproductive for your [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5108.78s)]
*  business, your businesses to provide entertainment. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5113.78s)]
*  And then some of your more successful businesses are the movies and shows. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5116.78s)]
*  They're wild shows. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5120.78s)]
*  Like crazy shit happens in these shows, but not with comedy. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5122.78s)]
*  With comedy, we have to gatekeep. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5126.78s)]
*  We have to keep it. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5127.78s)]
*  And I think they realized after they did a few of those things that nobody watches them. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5128.78s)]
*  People hate them. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5132.78s)]
*  And it actually is bad for their business. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5133.78s)]
*  And then they do the Brady Rose. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5135.78s)]
*  Boom! [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5137.82s)]
*  And they're like, OK. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5138.82s)]
*  You know, and when I did my special, they had no limitations on me. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5140.82s)]
*  They didn't say anything. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5144.82s)]
*  And they have before? [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5145.82s)]
*  And it was live. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5146.82s)]
*  But no, because it was live. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5147.82s)]
*  They're like, we're not telling you what to say. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5149.82s)]
*  It's live. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5151.82s)]
*  Just go ahead. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5152.82s)]
*  We trust you. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5153.82s)]
*  They went to see me live at the club. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5154.82s)]
*  They're like, OK. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5156.82s)]
*  I'm like, really? [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5157.82s)]
*  OK. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5158.82s)]
*  They're letting it go. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5159.82s)]
*  Now, Tony has a special that's coming out on Netflix. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5161.82s)]
*  They're doing Kill Tony is on Netflix now. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5164.82s)]
*  He's doing more roasts on Netflix. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5166.86s)]
*  Yeah, that's great. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5168.86s)]
*  That's what you need. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5169.86s)]
*  And then I think it's also the competition with YouTube because so many people like Shane [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5170.86s)]
*  put his special out on YouTube. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5174.86s)]
*  Ari put Jew on YouTube. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5176.86s)]
*  So many people are putting these wild specials on YouTube and they're getting massive numbers. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5177.86s)]
*  Massive numbers. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5182.86s)]
*  And so I think they're just like, look, this is a we're in the fucking business. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5183.86s)]

*  This is obviously like super popular and people love it. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5188.86s)]
*  And it's also really good. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5191.86s)]

*  He's the nicest guy on earth. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5310.0199999999995s)]
*  But he's so funny. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5312.06s)]
*  He's so ridiculous. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5313.06s)]
*  I don't want to tell you what he's talking about now. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5314.06s)]
*  I don't want to give it away. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5316.06s)]
*  But comics just line up to watch this guy. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5317.06s)]
*  Like when he's on stage, we all get onto the balcony. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5319.06s)]
*  Like a Holtzman's brother. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5321.06s)]
*  Has he been in The Mothership? [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5322.06s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5323.06s)]
*  He headlines there all the time. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5324.06s)]
*  He's there all the time. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5325.06s)]
*  He wasn't having an audience in LA because they were putting him late at night. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5326.06s)]
*  And here we're like, throw him up at 10 o'clock. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5329.06s)]
*  Let him headline. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5332.06s)]
*  Give him 40 minutes, man. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5334.06s)]
*  Let him go off. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5336.06s)]
*  I love it. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5337.06s)]
*  It's fun. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5338.06s)]
*  It's a good time for comedy. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5339.06s)]
*  A really good time for comedy. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5340.06s)]
*  But movies, though, we need movies. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5341.1s)]
*  Movies haven't cut up, though. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5343.1s)]
*  No, but have you seen... [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5344.1s)]
*  I'm not saying we got to go make Tropic Thunder multiple times. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5345.1s)]
*  Have you seen Segura's new Netflix series? [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5348.1s)]
*  No. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5350.1s)]
*  Oh, my gosh. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5351.1s)]
*  Is it? [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5353.1s)]
*  It's so crazy. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5354.1s)]
*  It's so crazy. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5355.1s)]
*  It's called Bad Thoughts. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5357.1s)]
*  It's these short sketches, these short films, essentially. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5358.1s)]
*  They're all like short, like five, 10 minute films. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5361.1s)]
*  And there's just a bunch of them. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5364.1s)]
*  And they're fucking ridiculous. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5366.1s)]
*  Like, so outrageous and so crazy that you're watching like, [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5368.14s)]
*  no, no, oh, my God, what the fuck, dude? [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5371.14s)]
*  Is it just them or is Bert? [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5376.14s)]
*  No, Bert is not in it. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5378.14s)]
*  And Bert actually made a video congratulating Tom [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5379.14s)]
*  and saying, I don't know why I wasn't on it. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5382.14s)]
*  Did you think about me having me on it? [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5384.14s)]
*  Kind of weird that my best friend didn't have me on his show. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5386.14s)]
*  He's like, I'm kind of... [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5389.14s)]
*  And he said, Tom, I'm kind of joking, [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5390.14s)]
*  but also kind of serious. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5392.14s)]
*  Like, was there any talks about having me on it? [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5393.14s)]
*  He's a little hurt. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5395.14s)]
*  Your first alternate, Bert, you just missed the cut. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5396.18s)]
*  I wasn't on it either. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5399.18s)]
*  You know, who cares? [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5401.18s)]
*  It's great. It's really great. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5402.18s)]
*  And it's again, it's like Netflix taking wild chances. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5404.18s)]
*  Just completely wild chances. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5407.18s)]
*  They've got so much goddamn money. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5409.18s)]
*  Yes, yeah, and so many viewers. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5411.18s)]
*  You know, it's like if you want to reach the most people, [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5413.18s)]
*  it's YouTube and then Netflix. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5416.18s)]
*  You think UFC's gonna go to Netflix? [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5418.18s)]
*  I don't know if they could do that. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5420.18s)]
*  I'm a dummy. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5422.18s)]
*  I'm not a business guy. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5424.22s)]
*  I don't understand. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5426.22s)]
*  So the problem is, would they be pay-per-view still? [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5427.22s)]
*  Because the Mike Tyson, Jake Paul fight was on Netflix [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5431.22s)]
*  and it was just, you could just watch it. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5434.22s)]
*  Just like you watch everything else. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5436.22s)]
*  You have to pay more for it. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5437.22s)]
*  So if they had the UFC on Netflix, [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5438.22s)]
*  but they made people pay more for it, [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5440.22s)]
*  I don't know how that would work out. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5442.22s)]
*  What if you just did like five bucks? [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5444.22s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5448.22s)]
*  Well, that's a good question, right? [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5450.22s)]
*  Like if the UFC was $5 instead of $70, [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5452.26s)]
*  would you actually make more money? [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5455.26s)]
*  Because you would get millions of downloads [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5457.26s)]
*  or millions of views? [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5459.26s)]
*  We think about the user base on Netflix. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5460.26s)]
*  Right. It's pretty immense. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5462.26s)]
*  It's gotta be what? [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5464.26s)]
*  $500 million? [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5465.26s)]
*  A billion? [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5466.26s)]
*  Yeah, we'll find out. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5468.26s)]
*  It's gotta be way bigger than ESPN+. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5470.26s)]
*  ESPN plus fucked themselves with it a couple ago. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5473.26s)]
*  I couldn't even get it on my TV. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5477.26s)]
*  They had a crash during the Ankaliyev-Parrera fight, right? [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5479.3s)]
*  That's not good. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5482.3s)]
*  I was like looking online, like, what the fuck? [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5483.3s)]
*  I'm not the only one. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5485.3s)]
*  Like thousands of people were like... [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5486.3s)]
*  What was the root cause of that? [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5488.3s)]
*  Did they discern? [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5490.3s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5491.3s)]
*  It literally wouldn't let me get on. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5492.3s)]
*  That's another fight. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5494.3s)]
*  Parrera took that fight with a broken hand [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5495.3s)]
*  and a neurovirus. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5497.3s)]
*  I knew he was messed up. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5498.3s)]
*  He's an animal. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5500.3s)]
*  Netflix has 94 million monthly active users. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5501.3s)]
*  The company has over 300 million paid global subscribers. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5505.34s)]
*  So it's 300 million worldwide. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5509.34s)]
*  Top tier, ad-supported tier. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5511.34s)]
*  Oh, so they have an ad. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5514.34s)]
*  Now you can have ads so it's cheaper. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5515.34s)]
*  You can get it cheaper with ads. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5517.34s)]
*  Okay, they're distinct from paid subscribers. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5521.34s)]
*  Multiple individuals can share an account. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5523.34s)]
*  Do you have any idea what the average pay-per-view on UFC is? [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5525.34s)]
*  No, I don't. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5531.34s)]
*  I don't know what the numbers are. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5533.34s)]
*  Because I don't think they have to disclose it. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5534.38s)]
*  Do they even? [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5538.38s)]
*  They used to disclose them back in the day. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5539.38s)]
*  Boxing would all the time as a badge of honor. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5541.38s)]
*  Floyd would do... [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5544.38s)]
*  Four million for the Conor McGregor fight. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5546.38s)]
*  It was something crazy. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5548.38s)]
*  That was one of the records. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5549.38s)]
*  And then the Manny Pacquiao fight was the biggest one ever. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5551.38s)]
*  Who's coming back to fight? [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5553.38s)]
*  That's kind of crazy. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5555.38s)]
*  He's 46 years old. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5556.38s)]
*  But he's also saucy. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5559.38s)]
*  Great singer. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5561.38s)]
*  He's not going to come back 46 on the Natch. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5562.42s)]
*  I guarantee you. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5564.42s)]
*  You think so? [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5565.42s)]
*  Well, I mean, if I was a person that was like prone to ridiculous speculation, which I am. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5566.42s)]
*  I mean, he carried his knockout power through eight weight classes. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5573.42s)]
*  And his physique notably improved. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5578.42s)]
*  I mean, and boxing has always had a steroid issue. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5581.42s)]
*  Steroids... [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5585.42s)]
*  Steroids... [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5586.46s)]
*  Because weigh-in tests, tests on the day of the weigh-ins, is just an intelligence test. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5587.46s)]
*  It's just how good is your doctor? [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5592.46s)]
*  How good are the scientists? [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5594.46s)]
*  Same with UFC. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5596.46s)]
*  MMA was... [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5597.46s)]
*  Why did they stop doing that? [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5598.46s)]
*  Well... [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5600.46s)]
*  Or change the weight classes. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5601.46s)]
*  USADA. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5602.46s)]
*  When UFC brought in USADA, all that changed and people's physiques melted. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5603.46s)]
*  They changed radically. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5607.46s)]
*  Alistair Overeem is the greatest example. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5608.46s)]
*  Alistair, when he fought Brock Lesnar, got drug tested. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5610.46s)]
*  And he was saucy as fuck. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5614.5s)]
*  When he's flexing on stage, that's when he's Overeem. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5616.5s)]
*  260, solid as fuck, ripped. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5619.5s)]
*  And just one of the more elite strikers on planet Earth. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5623.5s)]
*  And Brock was fucked. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5627.5s)]
*  And then they make him take the drug test. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5628.5s)]
*  And he becomes a normal person with good fighting skills. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5631.5s)]
*  I mean, he wasn't the Overeem anymore, this destroyer. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5635.5s)]
*  On the sauce, man. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5639.5s)]
*  I would have loved to see what an Alistair Overeem run on the sauce would have been. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5640.54s)]
*  My God. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5645.54s)]
*  Demolishing people. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5646.54s)]
*  My God. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5647.54s)]
*  It would have been epic. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5648.54s)]
*  It would have been epic. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5650.54s)]
*  It would have been really wild to see. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5651.54s)]
*  So you want to see it back in the game. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5653.54s)]
*  Oh yeah! [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5655.54s)]
*  I want fun! [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5656.54s)]
*  I don't want to see fat heavyweights. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5657.54s)]
*  The fuck out of here. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5660.54s)]
*  I want Alistair back. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5662.54s)]
*  Get him back on the sauce. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5663.54s)]
*  Alistair's like a vegan now. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5665.54s)]
*  You think John Jones fights this year? [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5667.54s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5669.58s)]
*  I hope so. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5670.58s)]
*  But I don't know if he does. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5671.58s)]
*  He doesn't have to, right? [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5673.58s)]
*  He's a legend. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5674.58s)]
*  He's also 37. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5675.58s)]
*  At what point in time does he... [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5676.58s)]
*  Is he 36 or 37? [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5678.58s)]
*  At one point in time, does a fighter say enough is enough? [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5680.58s)]
*  Especially a natural fighter. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5684.58s)]
*  And if you are natural and you have to be today, they just test you way too much. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5685.58s)]
*  There's probably some shenanigans that go on. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5689.58s)]
*  You know, like when A-Rod had those gummies that had testosterone in them and only... [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5692.58s)]
*  It's a short lifespan. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5696.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5698.62s)]
*  There's probably some shenanigans that are still going on. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5699.62s)]
*  I mean, if Balco could get away with it 20 plus years now, you would think there's got [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5702.62s)]
*  to be people out there who are ahead of the game. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5709.62s)]
*  Well, when I talked to Nowitzki, he was pretty open about that. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5711.62s)]
*  Oh, you had him on here. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5714.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5715.62s)]
*  He was like, yeah, there's going to be methods that we don't catch. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5716.62s)]
*  Because there's always going to be some kind of a lab like Icarus, like the documentary [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5720.62s)]
*  Amazing documentary. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5725.66s)]
*  Woo! [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5726.66s)]
*  With the KGB. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5727.66s)]
*  Woo! [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5728.66s)]
*  That was incredible. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5729.66s)]
*  One of the greatest documentaries ever because... [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5730.66s)]
*  And he wasn't even doing that to... [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5732.66s)]
*  Right. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5734.66s)]
*  In general, he was just trying to... [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5735.66s)]
*  He stumbled upon it. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5736.66s)]
*  He stumbled upon it. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5737.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5738.66s)]
*  And then he did that other one afterwards, The Dissident. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5739.66s)]
*  I didn't see that one. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5741.66s)]
*  You didn't see that documentary? [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5742.66s)]
*  No. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5743.66s)]
*  It's all about the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5744.66s)]
*  Oh, really? [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5746.66s)]
*  And that one, interestingly enough, nobody wanted to stream that one. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5747.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5750.66s)]
*  Like, you had to buy that one. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5751.66s)]
*  That's surprising. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5752.66s)]
*  They put it on platforms, but you had to purchase it. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5753.7s)]
*  I think that might still be the case. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5755.7s)]
*  Because that one, you know, because Icarus was available everywhere. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5757.7s)]
*  What's that called? [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5760.7s)]
*  I'm going to use this legal term. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5761.7s)]
*  The Dissident. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5762.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5763.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5764.7s)]
*  It's very good, dude. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5765.7s)]
*  It's very good. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5766.7s)]
*  It's dark. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5767.7s)]
*  2020? [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5768.7s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5769.7s)]
*  Where does it say you can get it at? [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5770.7s)]
*  Just YouTube or... [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5771.7s)]
*  Tubi. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5772.7s)]
*  Tubi. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5773.7s)]
*  What the fuck is Tubi? [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5774.7s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5776.7s)]
*  That's what I'm saying, man. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5777.7s)]
*  It's one of those things where it's like, they buried that motherfucker. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5778.7s)]
*  Those are the ones I want to see. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5781.7s)]
*  Yeah, it was a good one. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5782.74s)]
*  Can't get platformed. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5783.74s)]
*  But Icarus, totally by accident, this guy stumbles upon... [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5786.74s)]
*  So what Brian was doing, Brian, who's an endurance athlete himself, was going to compete in a [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5790.74s)]
*  bicycle race naturally, and then the next year he's going to get doped up and document [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5797.74s)]
*  the entire thing. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5804.74s)]
*  So he gets a hold of this guy who is supposedly the head of the organization that stops drugs [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5805.74s)]
*  use in Russia. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5811.78s)]
*  But Gregory... [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5814.78s)]
*  Rychenkov. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5815.78s)]
*  Rychenkov starts explaining exactly how to do this. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5816.78s)]
*  How to get around this. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5821.78s)]
*  How to do this. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5822.78s)]
*  This is what you're going to take. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5823.78s)]
*  And then along the way, they get busted for tampering with the urine samples that were [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5824.78s)]
*  used during the Sochi Olympics. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5831.78s)]
*  So they find out that during the Sochi Olympics, everyone was doping. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5833.78s)]
*  Everyone was doping. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5838.82s)]
*  Russia got a ton of medals and they kicked ass and everything. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5840.82s)]
*  And interestingly enough, you said the one sport that they found that didn't benefit [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5844.82s)]
*  from steroid use was ice skating. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5848.82s)]
*  The figure skaters. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5852.82s)]
*  You had to have fine motor skill movement. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5854.82s)]
*  It was really just about being light and being able to perform those things over and over [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5857.82s)]
*  again. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5862.82s)]
*  And they didn't find evidence that giving those people steroids helped, which I thought [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5863.82s)]
*  was interesting because I would have thought it would have helped everything. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5866.86s)]
*  There's a lot of explosive power involved when they jump and spit in the air. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5869.86s)]
*  But so the entire team was doping and then they had a hole in the wall where they would [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5873.86s)]
*  take the real urine sample, pass it through the hole in the wall, and they would give [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5880.86s)]
*  them back a doctored urine sample. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5885.86s)]
*  But it was the KGB who was running that. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5887.86s)]
*  The KGB was running it, allegedly. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5889.86s)]
*  And the lids, through microscopic analysis, they had found that they developed some sort [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5891.9s)]
*  of a tool that could open the supposedly unopenable. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5897.9s)]
*  Without tampering with the... [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5901.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5902.9s)]
*  But they found all these scratches all over that indicated that some sort of a device [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5903.9s)]
*  had gotten in there and popped open the little things that kept the lid from coming off. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5906.9s)]
*  Woo. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5912.9s)]
*  Well, it's like, you know, when you have the Olympics, I think, first of all, my position [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5913.9s)]
*  in the Olympics is that it's a giant scam against the athletes. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5918.94s)]
*  The athletes are generating insane wealth and they get none of it. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5923.94s)]
*  None of it. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5927.94s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5928.94s)]
*  Like the top one-tenth of one percent can make any type of money. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5929.94s)]
*  Yeah, and then they go out and then maybe the top tenth of one percent, they get endorsement [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5933.94s)]
*  deals and that's where they benefit from winning a gold medal in the Olympics. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5937.94s)]
*  Meanwhile, the people that run it, the networks, everybody else, billions. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5941.94s)]
*  Billions. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5945.94s)]
*  Billions of dollars. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5946.94s)]
*  The thing that people want to see, the athletes get none of it. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5947.98s)]
*  That is a crazy deal. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5952.98s)]
*  Especially if you're in a sport that nobody... [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5953.98s)]
*  You're a decathlete. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5956.98s)]
*  Right. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5957.98s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5958.98s)]
*  You're making no money. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5959.98s)]
*  You're a shot putter. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5960.98s)]
*  Congrats on the gold medal. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5961.98s)]
*  Now get your ass back to work. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5962.98s)]
*  Nobody gives a fuck who won synchronized swimming. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5963.98s)]
*  You're not getting any money. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5965.98s)]
*  But meanwhile, billions of people are watching on television. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5967.98s)]
*  There's an immense amount of ad revenue and you're not getting a penny. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5970.98s)]
*  And that's the only thing that they ever put on TV like that where you don't get a penny. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5974.98s)]
*  NBA gets a cut, NFL gets a cut, everybody gets paid. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5977.98s)]
*  Everybody gets paid in boxing. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5981.98s)]
*  Everybody gets paid in every fucking sport there is. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5982.98s)]
*  And these fucking athletes won every four years. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5986.98s)]
*  And by the way, you better fucking perform in the trials. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5988.98s)]
*  You can run the world record that year in competition and then go to the trials like a thing Mud did, our 800 runner, and get tripped. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5991.98s)]
*  Oh, fuck it, you missed the Olympics. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=5999.98s)]
*  And some of these gymnasts who are the best in the world, famous, are poor. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6001.98s)]
*  Best in the world at what they do, spectacular performances. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6007.98s)]
*  The whole world cheers. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6011.98s)]
*  We're watching them with bated breath on television. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6013.98s)]
*  Pull it off, pull it off. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6016.98s)]
*  They stick the line, yes. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6018.98s)]
*  They get nothing. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6020.98s)]
*  Nothing. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6022.98s)]
*  It's a dirty, dirty scam that's been going on for so long people have just accepted it because it started back when there was no money in it. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6024.98s)]
*  Because there was no television. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6032.98s)]
*  Like when you see Richard, when you see Adolf Hitler just fucking jonesing at the 36 Olympics. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6034.0199999999995s)]
*  Just fucking, just stripping. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6040.0199999999995s)]
*  Don't let him beat you. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6043.0199999999995s)]
*  He's just, whatever the fuck he was on, that guy was feeling it. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6045.0199999999995s)]
*  I love that video. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6050.0199999999995s)]
*  Jesse Owen just fucking torches it. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6052.0199999999995s)]
*  Puts up the fist. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6054.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, amazing moment in history. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6056.0199999999995s)]
*  But it's just, that was no money, right? [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6058.0199999999995s)]
*  Because there was no money. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6060.0199999999995s)]
*  And then once television rolled in, they didn't say, hey, let's cut these athletes in on this. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6061.06s)]
*  We're making billions of dollars now. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6066.06s)]
*  Nope, nope. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6068.06s)]
*  They can't even pay for their fucking training. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6070.06s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6072.06s)]
*  It's fucking disgusting. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6074.06s)]
*  Not only that, you're never going to beat the Cubans and the Russians back then because they were funding everything. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6076.06s)]
*  I mean, these people didn't have to worry about how they were going to feed themselves healthy food while they're preparing to box in the Olympics like our guys did. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6078.06s)]
*  You know, it's like we. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6086.06s)]
*  And the Chinese, what they're doing with their athletes too. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6088.06s)]
*  They send them away super early and then you're in a program for 10 years to prepare. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6089.1s)]
*  Especially Russian wrestlers. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6095.1s)]

*  Karelin, who the photo that I have out in the gyms, maybe my favorite sports photo of all time, Karelin picking up that 300 pound man like he was nothing. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6103.1s)]
*  Like I pick up a 45 pound kettlebell. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6114.1s)]
*  He's fucking with his grit and he's fed that picture. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6115.14s)]

*  His parents were like five five. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6123.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6125.14s)]

*  Natural. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6129.14s)]
*  I mean, he didn't even seem like a fucking human. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6131.14s)]
*  When you saw him compete in his prime, guys would just flatten out on the ground, try to just protect themselves from being pummeled into the earth over and over again. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6133.14s)]
*  He wrestled different than everybody. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6142.18s)]
*  Everybody was just trying to take you down. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6144.18s)]
*  He was trying to pick you up and slam you repeatedly into the earth like you getting hit in the head by the world. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6147.18s)]
*  He just did it over and over again to these guys just broke. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6155.18s)]
*  I mean, the freak of all freaks. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6159.18s)]
*  Look at the fucking musculature on this man. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6162.18s)]
*  Totally natural, by the way. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6165.18s)]
*  Of course. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6167.18s)]
*  Yeah, I just ate a lot of borscht. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6169.18s)]
*  Borscht. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6170.22s)]
*  Just eating Russian sausages and what? [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6172.22s)]
*  Beets. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6177.22s)]
*  Well, how about those European women athletes, the Eastern Bloc athletes, the women that they set records that still to this day haven't been broken. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6179.22s)]
*  Yeah, and won't. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6186.22s)]
*  I think that's the whole scandal about getting transgender guys to change weightlifting. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6188.22s)]
*  Yeah, take back some of those European medals. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6191.22s)]
*  Yeah, get the Bulgarians. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6194.22s)]
*  Who are they letting in the Olympics? [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6196.22s)]
*  They're letting some trans athletes compete in the Olympics, which is like, OK, is that what we're doing? [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6197.26s)]
*  Weren't the boxers in the couple boxers fighting each other for a goal that we're trans? [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6203.26s)]
*  They thought, no, one guy fought a woman, but it's like a guy with a micro penis, allegedly, and like internal testicles, but went through purity as a man, looks like a man, the whole deal. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6208.26s)]
*  And then did a chromosome test for allegedly for previous boxing organization body. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6220.3s)]
*  And they came back X, Y and like, you're a man. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6229.3s)]
*  And then, you know, that was very controversial. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6233.3s)]
*  They didn't do that with the Olympics, which they clearly should. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6236.3s)]
*  Like they should do that with all sports. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6239.3s)]
*  You know, that's what the enhanced games guys are going to do. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6241.3s)]
*  You know, the enhanced games. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6243.3s)]
*  No. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6245.3s)]
*  The enhanced games is a very well funded idea. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6246.34s)]
*  And they're they're called the enhanced. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6249.34s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. They're all going to be on the juice. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6252.34s)]
*  They're going to be on the best steroids money can buy the best current techno, all the athletes. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6255.34s)]
*  And they're going to pay them when they win. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6260.34s)]
*  It's like millions of dollars. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6263.34s)]
*  There's millions. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6265.34s)]
*  So they're they're putting this together as a huge event, and they're trying to entice the best athletes in the world to do this safely. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6267.34s)]
*  This is the enhanced games. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6272.34s)]
*  The update coming, I guess, next week. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6273.38s)]
*  So we have the guys on who were the guys who put together this. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6276.38s)]
*  And I said, what do you get? [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6282.38s)]
*  How are you going to deal with trans athletes? [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6284.38s)]
*  And they were like, I think we're going to do chromosomes, which is the right way to do it. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6286.38s)]
*  Let's stop fucking around. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6290.38s)]
*  You know, just stop pretending that these males that identify as women who win what is like 700 women were robbed of gold medals and very cross various sports. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6292.38s)]
*  Might have been more than that because these biological men pretended to be women and identified as women and dominated in women's sports. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6303.38s)]
*  They have a giant advantage. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6313.38s)]
*  Stop pretending they don't. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6315.38s)]
*  Just stop. And if you want people to compete, if you still want to compete and you're a woman, you know, you should have to. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6317.38s)]
*  I mean, you should be protected and only have to compete against other actual biological women. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6325.38s)]
*  Period. End of discussion. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6330.38s)]
*  It's not bigoted to say trans women movement is actually anti-woman. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6331.42s)]
*  One hundred percent, especially when it comes to sports. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6336.42s)]
*  One hundred percent. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6339.42s)]
*  That's what I mean. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6341.42s)]
*  You're not seeing trans men dominating anything. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6343.42s)]
*  No, because there's a biological difference. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6346.42s)]
*  Well, it's also a problem because if you're a trans man, now you have to take testosterone, which is banned. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6348.42s)]
*  You can't take it. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6354.42s)]
*  So are you going to let them take it and you won't let older athletes take it? [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6356.42s)]
*  That sounds crazy. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6359.42s)]
*  It doesn't make sense. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6361.42s)]
*  So you get like a 39 year old athlete has low testosterone. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6363.42s)]
*  You won't let him take it, but you let a woman take it to become a man like, shut the fuck up. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6365.42s)]
*  Chromosomes. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6370.42s)]
*  Double X and X, Y. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6372.42s)]
*  That's way too much common sense there, Joe. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6375.42s)]
*  It's just it's the idea that that's bigoted is so crazy when there's a demonstrable effect. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6377.42s)]
*  Like you can clearly see that these people that are identifying as women but are actually biological males have massive advantages. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6382.42s)]
*  Yeah, but the people who you're asking those questions, whether or not who are not able to answer whether or not there's a decided advantage, can't even define what a woman is. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6389.46s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6397.46s)]
*  But this is this kind of like head in the ground mindset is the same thing that you're seeing with COVID vaccines, the same thing you're seeing with pharmaceutical drugs, same thing you're seeing with USAID and government. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6399.46s)]
*  Cancer. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6411.46s)]
*  People just don't want to know most and also they feel helpless. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6413.46s)]
*  Right. So they want to be like reinforced and feel better. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6416.5s)]
*  There's most people that are listening to us right now are living paycheck to paycheck. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6420.5s)]
*  Most people. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6424.5s)]
*  If you're living paycheck to paycheck, how much are you going to stick your neck out for this? [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6426.5s)]
*  How much are you going to stick your neck out for anything? [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6429.5s)]
*  How much are you going to open your mind or open your mouth up about all cause mortalities? [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6432.5s)]
*  How much you go like all the different things that people are concerned with in the wars. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6439.5s)]
*  Low birth rates, the exposure to cancer. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6444.5s)]
*  Everything that's in the news, everything constantly. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6446.5s)]
*  How much you're going to stick your neck out? [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6449.5s)]
*  Most people aren't. They can't. They don't have time. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6451.5s)]
*  They have family. They have mortgages. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6453.5s)]
*  They're barely getting by. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6455.5s)]
*  They're not going to fucking risk everything. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6457.5s)]
*  And they're being told not to care. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6459.5s)]
*  Right. Yeah. And then they're being shamed if they do care. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6461.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6463.5s)]
*  Yeah. You don't want to be the anti-vaxxer at work. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6465.5s)]
*  If you say, well, I'm just telling you, I watch, I read some scientific papers being broken down by legitimate PhDs online. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6467.5s)]
*  They were explaining what the mechanism is that this stuff could cause cancer. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6473.5s)]
*  And they were saying, don't do your own research. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6476.5s)]
*  Do not. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6478.5s)]
*  That was my favorite. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6480.5s)]
*  That was my favorite. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6482.5s)]
*  Trust the experts. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6484.5s)]
*  That's like right out of Orwell. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6486.5s)]
*  And when it's Brian Stelter saying, all these people, they want to do their own research. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6488.5s)]
*  What do you do your own research? [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6492.5s)]
*  Why would you ever assume that everyone who listens is dumber than you? [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6494.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6498.5s)]
*  Why would you ever assume? [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6500.5s)]
*  And someone says there's medical research papers that you can clearly read that show you results. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6501.54s)]
*  Why can't I understand that? [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6508.54s)]
*  I can go through college and learn calculus. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6510.54s)]
*  I can figure out how to program a computer. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6512.54s)]
*  I can figure out all these things. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6514.54s)]
*  There's all these things that I can do. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6516.54s)]
*  But I can't research this effect that this, this chemical that I'm introducing to the human body does. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6518.54s)]
*  Don't do your own research. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6528.54s)]
*  Trust these experts. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6529.58s)]
*  You don't trust experts in anything. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6531.58s)]
*  Because over time they're wrong about certain things and new expertise emerges. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6533.58s)]
*  Look, they used to use leaded gasoline. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6539.58s)]
*  Should we trust the experts and keep putting lead in gasoline where they made IQs demonstrably lower? [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6541.58s)]
*  You can like statistically lower in places where people grew up, and I'm one of them, [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6548.58s)]
*  where grew up in a place where they, at the time where they had leaded gasoline. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6554.58s)]
*  I probably could have been way smarter when I was a kid. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6557.62s)]
*  I was just sniffing fucking leaded gas. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6561.62s)]
*  I have a buddy who has a, what he used to live in New York, [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6563.62s)]
*  and he was trying to do a garden in his background, his backyard. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6569.62s)]
*  But he's a smart dude, so he took soil samples, brought it to university, [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6572.62s)]
*  and said, you know, tell me like what's wrong with the soil. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6576.62s)]
*  It's like it's filled with lead. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6579.62s)]
*  All from those days, from back when everybody had leaded gasoline. [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6581.62s)]
*  It was just in the air. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6584.66s)]
*  Just everybody was like, [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6586.66s)]
*  just lead fumes. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6590.66s)]
*  Because they didn't want the engines to ping. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6592.66s)]
*  Because if you have, [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6595.66s)]
*  if you have unleaded gas, [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6597.66s)]
*  we used to have muscle cars back when I was in high school. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6599.66s)]
*  If you put unleaded gas in a muscle car, they would run like shit. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6602.66s)]
*  Because this was back when you could still buy leaded gas. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6607.66s)]
*  Like when did they make unleaded gas, Jamie? [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6610.66s)]
*  Yeah, like when was it introduced? [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6612.7s)]
*  And when did they, when did they ban leaded gas? [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6614.7s)]
*  That's the better question. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6617.7s)]
*  Because everybody was just breathing in this. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6620.7s)]
*  But the whole point is that things change. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6624.7s)]
*  We learn, we learn some stuff. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6627.7s)]
*  And if we're ignoring side effects, [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6629.7s)]
*  because we want to keep our head in the sand, [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6632.7s)]
*  that's crazy. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6634.7s)]
*  That stops the learning, which we need, [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6636.7s)]
*  which is why we don't do lobotomies anymore. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6638.7s)]
*  If you're a curious person, [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6640.7s)]
*  so lead was added to gasoline in the 20s to improve performance, [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6642.7s)]
*  but was later discovered that it was a pollutant and a neurotoxin. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6647.7s)]
*  Okay, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency began phasing out lead [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6650.7s)]
*  in the 1970s. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6654.7s)]
*  In 1996, the Clean Air Act banned sale of leaded gas. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6656.7s)]
*  They wanted to keep making that money, Aaron Rodgers. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6659.7s)]
*  So when I was a kid in high school, [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6665.7s)]
*  So they learned in the 70s and it took them, [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6668.7s)]
*  26 years. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6670.7s)]
*  26 years. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6672.7s)]
*  LOL. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6674.7s)]
*  So when I was in high school, [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6676.7s)]
*  because we had carburetors back then, [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6678.7s)]
*  none of those cars had electronic fuel injection. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6681.7s)]
*  You bought leaded gas. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6684.7s)]
*  And I drove mostly muscle cars through my younger years, [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6687.7s)]
*  so I probably knocked my IQ down quite a few notches. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6691.7s)]
*  At least three or four points. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6695.7s)]
*  People used to kill themselves in garages. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6697.7s)]
*  They would lock themselves in their garage [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6699.7s)]
*  and just let the engine run until they died. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6700.74s)]
*  That was the way people committed suicide. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6703.74s)]
*  They still do? [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6705.74s)]
*  Yeah, that's the way people do. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6707.74s)]
*  I know people who did that. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6709.74s)]
*  Like, I don't know them personally, [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6712.74s)]
*  but they're friends of people that I knew. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6714.74s)]
*  That they'd take a hose and attach it to the exhaust pipe [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6716.74s)]
*  and then put it inside the cabin. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6720.74s)]
*  And it's a... [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6722.74s)]
*  It's awful. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6724.74s)]
*  It's the way that people commit suicide. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6726.74s)]
*  What is that? Carbon monoxide poisoning? [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6728.74s)]
*  Yeah, and we just put that out in the air. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6730.74s)]
*  Yeah, but it at least doesn't have lead in it anymore. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6733.74s)]
*  That's good. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6736.74s)]
*  Fucking crazy. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6740.74s)]
*  So the point is, like, experts, [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6742.74s)]
*  they don't always catch all the problems [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=6744.74s)]

*  repeating no it wasn't even a big guy he was just I'm like I'm like I believe you we're [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7263.6s)]
*  we're all getting hammered and just that was back in the day when I could get [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7269.72s)]
*  drunk with locals so can't do no because see Theo Vaughn gotten an altercation in [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7274.04s)]
*  Nashville yesterday no a couple days ago yeah some guy was fucking with him for [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7279.92s)]
*  some viral video and Theo grabbed it by the neck and pushed him away [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7283.72s)]
*  Theo been training? I don't believe so. It was probably a bad move. You never know who you're grabbing. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7287.04s)]
*  But the guy was just doing it to get a rise out of Theo. He's fucking with them. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7294.96s)]
*  That's the tough part about being on public. Yeah but back then I wasn't so famous I could [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7298.8s)]
*  I could go around so it was fun. No one ever tried to fuck with you when you were out? [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7304.2s)]
*  Nah. They're all friendly. Most of the people who know me are nice. Who know of me. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7307.44s)]
*  It's like every now and then I get a side eye from a blue hair you know. Wearing a mask. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7312.72s)]
*  Take your mask down. I can't understand you. Take your mask down. That I helped Trump that's where it really [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7317.4400000000005s)]
*  ramped up. Before the Trump thing people didn't bother me. The Kamala stuff about what a moron to not come on the show. [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7322.92s)]
*  Well Pierre didn't come on either from Canada. I offered to have him on as well. Really? [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7328.8s)]
*  Yeah his people his people didn't want him coming on his people apparently thought that it was a [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7332.52s)]
*  bad idea for him to come on the show. Well I mean I think anybody with a brain knows that Trump coming on [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7339.32s)]
*  here had a big big sway on the election. I think Trump is a unique individual though. If you talk to a [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7345.28s)]
*  politician that only does well with canned questions and with speeches that were written in advance by [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7351.4s)]
*  skillful people. Like it's faint Trump famously rants okay. So did the he to have that ability to go up in [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7357.68s)]
*  front of 15,000 people and just have a rough outline of what you're gonna talk about. And so I sat to him [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7367.88s)]
*  you know and he just like started what he's doing Biden wandering around like not knowing where he's [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7374.88s)]
*  going. It's bro he's doing stand-up. Yeah. And he has a set and he's doing this set to arenas all over [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7379.96s)]
*  the everybody else has a script. Everybody else is reading off a teleprompter. Everybody else has to [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7385.64s)]
*  know what they're gonna be asked in advance. I mean Biden famously had the questions and who to call on [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7392.72s)]
*  and what the answer was supposed to be on that note card that got multiple times. Would you like to [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7397.6s)]
*  take whatever they gave him before the debate? Oh my gosh. I bet it's awesome. I bet it's like that shit [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7401.8s)]
*  from that Bradley Cooper movie. Yeah. Where all of a sudden you start seeing numbers in front of you and you're like I think I got it. I think I [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7407.4800000000005s)]
*  could do the debate. Like because every other time he's like barely coherent. Well that and an earpiece he did [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7414.4400000000005s)]
*  pretty well. Yeah there was probably some way of communicating with him for sure. I mean that I don't [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7420.92s)]
*  know why they would risk it. Like Kamala had some weird earrings. Remember those earrings? Yeah. And the company that made those [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7426.88s)]
*  blue teeth earrings was like kind of taking credit for it. Yeah nothing to see here. I just think it's funny. Now there's the one guy in [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7432.56s)]
*  CNN wrote a book about Biden's you know cognitive decline. Yeah. He was like one of the biggest proponents of like no he's sharp as [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7441.92s)]
*  ever sharp as a tack. You know. Yeah I don't know why they thought they could write that but it was all it was all fucking [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7449.12s)]
*  theater. They do a debate before anyone's ever done a debate. Let him go up there without his drugs. Yep. Without his uppers. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7454.96s)]
*  Yep. Without his earpiece. Yep. Trump's response to some of those. I don't know what you said but I don't think he does either. I don't know what you said. I was laughing at going what the fuck is this? He does either. Yeah. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7462.8s)]
*  Oh that's amazing. Yeah how about we beat Medicaid. Okay. So they cut the time off like oh my god like what are you doing? You guys set them up. But it's so bad it was so bad for the [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7476.16s)]
*  Democratic Party because if they were just honest about that and then had a primary. Yep. I just don't think he wanted to step down. And Jill didn't want to step down. No Jill. He's as sharp as ever. [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7489.44s)]
*  I remember she did the one thing afterwards where he got done. You answered all the questions. You answered all the questions. So good. My wife said that to me like what are you what did they give you? Are you high? What the fuck are you talking about? Of course I answered all the questions. She just answered the questions for him on the view. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7502.08s)]
*  Yeah that was even better. Like Dr. Jill's on here. I thought you did such a great job. You were such a great president. Is she a doctor like a medical doctor or is she like a PhD? She's like me. She's got honorary degree. No. No. No she probably has. I think she has a real one right? But that doctor thing is very sneaky. We should need a different distinction. You know like it should be PhD which is very impressive. Like you should be able to say I'm PhD Aaron Rodgers. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7517.68s)]
*  Yeah. But you have to say I'm Dr. Aaron Rodgers right? Like if you had a real PhD in something. I think I'd say PhD. Right but would you introduce yourself like that? That sounds gross. But saying Dr. Rodgers is like oh Dr. Jill. Yes. Yes she's a doctor. You're a doctor. Yeah a doctor. They used to call it Cosby. Dr. Cosby. Why? A lot of people call it because he got an honorary. I'm just putting this out there. I'll speak at university if you give me an honorary. [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7547.68s)]
*  I want to be Dr. Rogan. I think it would be fun. Oh for sure. It would be fun. People already think you are after your COVID comments. Well I was I had a good doctor actually. I had a good real doctor. They gave me good advice. Yeah how about that? Oh what a weird world we live in. Can't believe we're here. But what is Dr. Jill? In 2007 at age 55 she got a doctor of education from Delaware I think. Damn it. 55. [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7577.68s)]
*  Congrats. That's kind of wild. I wonder if she did it just to be a doctor. I just really want that. I think it's going to look good when Joe is the president. Yeah Dr. Jill. Didn't Joe be my favorite when she was like 15? Yeah. But when Biden was talking about his handicap to Trump. Oh yeah. I'll play you if you. You got to carry your own bag though. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7608.400000000001s)]
*  Shut the fuck up. You got to carry your own bag. You can't even move your arms. You're an eight handicapped Joe. He falls down going upstairs. That's so rare. It's so rare that people fall down going upstairs. It's tough to do. And you're going to beat Trump at golf. Trump is actually really good at golf. Yeah. Like he wins his club tournaments. Yeah. Which is crazy. Like you're playing with real golfers. Like he's apparently a really good golfer. Yeah. Like what is his golf handicap? I think he's definitely a single digit. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7629.52s)]
*  But that's a crazy thing to say for Biden. Biden also said he would kick his ass. Kick his ass. Yeah. I'd take him out to the woodshed. It was a fun time. Do you remember when he told that worker like they're like some sort of steel mill or something. I'll punch you in the face or something. He called him a dog face. What is it? Pony face liar. What the fuck did he say? Dog face. Pony face dog soldier. Something like that. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7659.52s)]
*  Pony face. I don't remember what the phrase was. Fucking neck sniffer. But it was fascinating. It was fascinating watching people run cover for him. You know. Yeah. It just like that really damaged the Democrat Party that they let them do that. Because imagine if they didn't. Imagine if they had a real primary like a real one. And you know Bobby would have a chance. Yes. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. One hundred percent. Especially if they let him talk. Especially if they let him present some of the information. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7689.52s)]
*  That everybody's saying he's a kook. Let me present this to you. And he's so calm because he's been doing this for so long he doesn't get emotional which is a real trap. When you're accused of being a kook and you get emotional it's a real trap. Or super defensive. Yeah. Super defensive and he doesn't do that. And I thought he was great in the you know in the sessions of Congress when he was trying to what do they call that when they're asking all those questions and trying to fucking pin him down when he's nominated. Yeah. I thought he was great. No he's great. But he's a brilliant guy. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7719.52s)]
*  But these guys didn't have this voice issue. It would be a shoe in. I mean he would be. He would have won. He would have won. He would have been the next president. Like I'm not bullshitting. If they if the Democratic Party allowed him. They had no gatekeeping and allowed a real primary. And Bobby got in and Bobby didn't have a voice problem. And he had the intellect that he has and the background that he has and the history of environmental protection that he has. I mean he was an environmental attorney that literally helped clean up the [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7749.52s)]
*  East River. He stopped these companies from poisoning the environment. And that's my problem with the entire Democratic Party is that is that just because Trump won and Elon is working for him and Bobby's working for him and insert anybody's put in his cabinet all the good shit that they're doing. [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7779.52s)]
*  The billions that Elon has found of just fraud and corruption and bullshit. Bobby's saying hey let's just look at these vaccines. Let's look at the efficacy. Let's do real safety tests on these. Like all the common sense shit that's going on right now by the cabinet members dissolving the Department of Education. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7797.78s)]
*  All the different things are doing like if it's good for the country if it's common sense good for the country. Why are we not on fucking board with it doesn't mean you shouldn't criticize the bad stuff. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7818.6s)]
*  No if you criticize everything or if you ignore all the good stuff then no one is going to listen to you. You can't do that. It's like if you have an enemy if I have an enemy I don't have an enemy. But if I had one and he was really good at something I'd be like I think he's a piece of shit. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7827.72s)]
*  But I'll tell you what he's fucking talented like this thing that he does. He's really good at it. That's just fact. It just is what it is. And if you think someone's doing if they're on the wrong party in your eyes but they're doing something good you're like I think that's good. [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7840.98s)]
*  I think this is important as good for everybody. Like it has nothing to do with parties. It should have nothing to do. There's something that a person that you don't like who's in office and they pass a bill and that bill benefits us all. [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7854.4s)]
*  We should all celebrate. And the fact that we don't is nuts. The fact that no one cared that Elon brought those fucking people back from space. The guy's a fucking hero for that. And any other time in history any other time in history the super genius sent a fucking rocket to go rescue the people that were trapped in orbit because NASA couldn't. [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7867.72s)]
*  They couldn't. And if he'd done it in 2016 when Obama was in there it would have been fucking great. It would have been great. And they could have done it while Biden was in office. But they wouldn't let him do it because politically it would look like a victory for Trump because Elon supports Trump. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7885.46s)]
*  So they left those people up there. That's fucking wrong. It's evil. It's evil. It shouldn't be a political thing. 96 percent of the articles about Elon are bad. 96 percent. Yeah. You're attacking one of the smartest guys in the country who literally is spending part of his time trying to fucking clean up the government efficiency and waste and corruption and fraud. And there was a comparison to 96 percent of something else that was all good. That might not be good. See if you can find that. [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7902.34s)]
*  That comparison talking about Pelosi's stock trades. You don't hear a peep out of that. There's no media stories about except for a bill that was put out there that was kind of a policy bill. They're all the policy bill. Didn't fucking make it. I love the one time when she gets asked during a press briefing. [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7932.34s)]
*  I think we shall participate. There's no conflict of interest. She just floor winds in going what are they talking stock trading. I don't even know what they're talking about. I mean that's something that Elon has said we should investigate. How come these people are on both sides. It is on both sides. 100 percent. That's something that maybe we could have bipartisan support for. There's some bipartisan support that maybe there's a difference in how the people look at things. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7950.34s)]
*  partisan things that people support. [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7980.34s)]
*  One of them is the new Ibogaine research, [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7982.46s)]
*  which is wonderful. [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7984.5s)]
*  It got past the first step in Texas. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7985.5s)]
*  Good. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7987.62s)]
*  The Ibogaine for, then they're gonna do [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7988.46s)]
*  PTSD for soldiers, veterans. [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7990.46s)]
*  That has bipartisan support. [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7993.26s)]
*  I love when something has bipartisan support. [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7994.860000000001s)]
*  That should too. [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7997.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=7999.22s)]
*  Yeah, the Elon stuff should be like, [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8000.04s)]
*  look what he's done. [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8001.7s)]
*  We should be championing it. [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8003.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8004.900000000001s)]
*  Okay, you don't like his politics, fine. [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8005.74s)]
*  Right. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8007.46s)]

*  Look at his kid on Trump's lap and blah, blah, blah, blah. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8019.9800000000005s)]
*  I think as soon as he got the Twitter files [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8022.5s)]
*  and he found out what the government was doing, [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8025.26s)]

*  Ask your buddy, Alex about it probably. [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8061.8s)]

*  If Elon didn't allow him to put info wars on Twitter too, [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8087.44s)]
*  he puts all of his shows on Twitter. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8091.679999999999s)]
*  And they got millions and millions of views. [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8093.24s)]
*  And guess what? [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8095.28s)]
*  He's right. [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8096.28s)]
*  All the fucking time. [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8098.24s)]

*  No one even knows who did Sandy Hook. [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8104.599999999999s)]
*  You ask the average person Sandy Hook, [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8106.639999999999s)]
*  they're connected to Alex Jones. [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8108.04s)]
*  They don't even know the guy who was the actual murderer. [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8109.639999999999s)]
*  And here's my question. [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8113.24s)]
*  How does one get bad information about that? [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8114.679999999999s)]
*  And how much that bad information is fed to a guy like him [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8117.2s)]
*  so that he repeats it, so that you could trap him [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8120.28s)]
*  and then you accuse him of it? [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8123.679999999999s)]
*  He's been right so many times [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8125.72s)]
*  about so many other things. [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8127.72s)]
*  They got him with that one. [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8129.64s)]
*  But I mean, that's what I mean, [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8130.8s)]
*  because he's been right so many times, [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8131.68s)]
*  you gotta shut him up. [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8133.08s)]
*  It's a way. [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8134.08s)]
*  I mean, it's certainly, and then Oslo, [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8134.92s)]
*  he was like, he was going through it during that time. [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8136.320000000001s)]
*  He was drinking way, way, way too much. [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8139.56s)]
*  He was drinking all day. [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8141.72s)]
*  And he was, imagine you're in a job [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8142.56s)]
*  where you're uncovering things [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8145.08s)]
*  that nobody else knows all the time. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8147.96s)]
*  All the time. [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8150.52s)]
*  That's a lot of pressure. [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8152.6s)]
*  There's no way you could research all of it too [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8154.12s)]
*  down to the bone either. [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8155.88s)]
*  And when someone sends you videos that have been doctored [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8157.32s)]
*  or someone tries to tell you they're using crisis actors, [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8159.8s)]
*  that's a classic one. [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8163.5199999999995s)]
*  People say they use crisis actors. [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8165.12s)]
*  I don't doubt that. [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8167.32s)]
*  I don't doubt that there have been times [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8169.36s)]
*  where the government was trying to promote [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8171.2s)]
*  some sort of a narrative, [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8173.2s)]
*  and maybe they did something that went sideways, [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8175.12s)]
*  and then they brought in some people to pretend [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8177.6s)]
*  that they saw something that didn't happen, [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8180.08s)]
*  or they described something in a way [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8182.2s)]
*  that wasn't true or accurate. [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8184.16s)]
*  I think the government would definitely do that. [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8186.24s)]
*  They've done so much. [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8188.44s)]
*  They've done so much. [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8189.28s)]
*  Golf of the Talk and Operation Northwoods. [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8190.2s)]
*  Yeah, the idea that they wouldn't have people, [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8192.52s)]
*  but I don't think that would work anymore. [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8195.88s)]
*  See, the thing is, yeah. [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8198.4s)]
*  Because you can't control Joe, [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8200.2s)]
*  concerned citizen on the street with their phone out. [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8202.4s)]
*  Too many people have phones. [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8204.64s)]
*  It's like that fucking ship has left the harbor. [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8205.92s)]
*  You're not doing that anymore. [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8209.96s)]
*  I don't think, unless, [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8212.52s)]

*  Insane. [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8222.64s)]

*  The scary thing is China. [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8252.92s)]
*  Well, the scary thing, [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8254.640000000001s)]
*  I was living in New Jersey last year [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8255.480000000001s)]
*  when the drone stuff was going on. [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8256.800000000001s)]
*  Oh boy. [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8258.28s)]
*  Did you see him? [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8259.12s)]
*  I saw a drone, a military style drone, silent drone, [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8259.94s)]
*  above, drove, it flew right over my car. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8262.84s)]
*  It was silent? [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8265.24s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8266.12s)]
*  Really? [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8267.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8268.04s)]
*  It made no noise. [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8268.880000000001s)]
*  Did you open the window and get out of the car? [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8270.08s)]
*  Yes, the window was, I was leaning my head out, [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8271.92s)]
*  looking up at it and it was probably 50 yards or less [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8273.84s)]
*  up in the sky and it flew right over my car. [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8278.679999999998s)]
*  And there were, and I'd sit in my backyard at night [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8281.96s)]
*  and see a lot of weird shit in the skies. [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8283.96s)]
*  What did it look like? [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8285.679999999998s)]
*  That one looked like a military style drone. [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8287.16s)]
*  A smaller version though. [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8289.48s)]
*  The one that was like, [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8291.32s)]
*  it was more like the size of this room end to end. [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8292.96s)]
*  Actually less, probably three quarters of the size of it. [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8295.72s)]

*  And so it looked like the standard military drone, [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8300.44s)]
*  but it was silent. [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8301.68s)]
*  Yep. [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8302.640000000001s)]

*  I had coaches who'd seen them over their house, [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8310.2s)]
*  different ones, most of them they were seeing [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8313.12s)]

*  that didn't look like military stuff. [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8318.12s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8322.2s)]
*  They even had some briefing and the Jersey governor [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8323.04s)]

*  I ran off the coast and blah, blah. [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8329.6s)]
*  And then Trump said, oh, we know what it is. [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8331.8s)]
*  But nobody ever said what it was. [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8334.36s)]

*  You know, the transfer of power [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8346.6s)]

*  something might happen. [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8359.52s)]

*  I think not only have they tried to do that since the 1950s, [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8443.640000000001s)]

*  certain individuals. [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8451.2s)]
*  They've successfully manipulated people. [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8452.36s)]
*  I think they did it with the Manson family. [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8455.28s)]
*  And I don't think that stuff just ends. [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8457.2s)]
*  The Chaos Book was awesome. [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8459.640000000001s)]

*  Yeah, I don't think that ended. [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8463.4s)]
*  Why would they end that if it's effective? [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8465.24s)]
*  They would just be more secretive about it. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8466.880000000001s)]
*  Just like they're probably super secretive [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8469.36s)]
*  about these propulsion systems. [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8471.52s)]

*  There are representatives, but clearly, [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8479.720000000001s)]

*  and all these people that have power and secrecy. [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8486.0s)]
*  And Kennedy railed about it in the 1960s [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8488.68s)]
*  and they shot them in the head. [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8491.640000000001s)]
*  Speaking of that, that whole thing, [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8492.800000000001s)]
*  because that's what got me into questioning things. [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8495.560000000001s)]
*  And then they roll out four or five [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8499.04s)]
*  internet-influenced people [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8502.16s)]
*  to give them some notebook or some shit. [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8504.48s)]
*  They actually release some information [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8507.2s)]
*  about the Kennedy files. [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8508.68s)]
*  And it's literally a heavily redacted pile of nothingness. [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8510.0s)]
*  My question about that is, [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8515.88s)]
*  if you're gonna shoot Kennedy, [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8518.88s)]
*  you're not gonna write it down. [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8520.2s)]
*  I don't think we're gonna find anything. [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8522.4s)]
*  I didn't think we were gonna find anything [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8524.4s)]
*  that's like, we did it. [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8525.92s)]
*  We were in the grassy knoll [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8527.0s)]
*  and we hired these assassins and here's their pay stubs. [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8528.32s)]
*  What I thought it would be is maybe [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8531.56s)]
*  we would find out some information [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8534.199999999999s)]
*  about who Lee Harvey Oswald was actually working for. [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8535.72s)]
*  Maybe we would find out how he was able to defect to Russia [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8538.8s)]
*  and then come back to America, [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8543.08s)]
*  how he got in the schoolbook depository and nobody, [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8545.279999999999s)]
*  like they don't do a security run of the area [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8548.16s)]
*  where the Secret Service checks to see [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8551.72s)]
*  where the vulnerabilities would be. [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8553.52s)]
*  They do that kind of stuff. [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8554.96s)]
*  Why would you put him in an open convertible [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8556.32s)]
*  when you have multiple places where people can hide? [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8559.08s)]
*  It seems like they killed him. [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8564.119999999999s)]
*  And the Zapruder film. [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8565.16s)]
*  So I think they killed, [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8567.279999999999s)]
*  somebody asked me this the other night on stage. [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8569.16s)]
*  It was one of those bottom of the barrel questions. [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8571.08s)]
*  If you could find out who killed JFK or if aliens are real. [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8573.6s)]
*  I'm like, aliens? [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8577.4s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8854.76s)]
*  He seems pretty diabolical. [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8855.88s)]
*  He's probably working with somebody. [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8857.56s)]
*  Before somebody. [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8859.52s)]
*  Maybe. [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8860.68s)]
*  And maybe he just got too far out there. [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8861.52s)]
*  Some of the shit that came out on the trial, though, [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8863.04s)]
*  like he's forcing his girlfriend to have sex [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8864.96s)]
*  with prostitutes while he was sitting there [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8867.16s)]
*  jacking off with a bandana on. [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8869.48s)]
*  She'd rub the jizz on his nipples. [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8871.88s)]
*  Like, what are we even talking about? [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8874.2s)]
*  But what's he gonna go away for? [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8877.84s)]
*  Like, what's the charge? [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8880.119999999999s)]
*  Good question. [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8880.96s)]
*  Is it kidnapping or is it [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8881.8s)]
*  I don't think he's even being charged for beating her up. [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8884.8s)]
*  Like, the video of him beating her up, [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8888.64s)]
*  he's not even getting charged for that. [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8890.359999999999s)]
*  Megyn Kelly said that. [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8893.16s)]
*  Who's got all the videos? [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8894.679999999998s)]
*  Yeah, what's in the videos? [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8897.119999999999s)]
*  What's that about? [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8899.72s)]
*  I mean, what would happen? [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8901.439999999999s)]
*  What would happen if we had videos? [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8903.8s)]
*  We need Candace to do a deep dive. [[02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8905.759999999998s)]
*  If we got videos of thousands of celebrities [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8907.08s)]
*  just butt fucking each other and sucking dicks [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8910.28s)]
*  and taking Molly and guys are passing them around, like [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8912.92s)]
*  Collins pleaded not guilty to the new superseding indictment [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8917.28s)]
*  which added two charges to bring the total to five. [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8920.72s)]
*  He's charged with racketeering, conspiracy, [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8923.4s)]
*  transportation to engage in prostitution, [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8925.6s)]
*  and sex trafficking. [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8927.64s)]
*  So he's not being charged with the assault. [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8929.6s)]
*  The sex trafficking is the worst. [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8933.039999999999s)]
*  But he could get charged with it in the future. [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8933.88s)]
*  It's not like they can't charge him with more stuff. [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8936.080000000002s)]
*  That's what he needs to do. [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8939.320000000002s)]
*  Alleged to use threats, force, and coercion [[02:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8940.44s)]
*  to get victims to engage in sex acts [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8943.240000000002s)]
*  once allegedly dangling a victim [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8945.0s)]
*  over an apartment balcony, according to prosecutors. [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8946.6s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8950.68s)]
*  Okay, Diddy Bodyguard says, [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8955.480000000001s)]
*  witnesses went missing before trial, [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8958.0s)]
*  said he was poisoned three times. [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8959.68s)]
*  Did you find the cyanide thing? [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8962.960000000001s)]
*  I was trying to read this, [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8964.76s)]
*  I think it's right as you said that. [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8965.6s)]
*  But if you put it in here. [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8967.64s)]
*  It says, I've been poisoned three times, [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8969.48s)]
*  toxicology report showed cyanide. [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8971.16s)]
*  Whoa, cyanide metabolizes into pneumonia in your body. [[02:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8973.08s)]
*  So I've had pneumonia on three occasions, he claimed. [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8977.16s)]
*  Big homie. Big homie. [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8979.44s)]
*  These problems didn't start for me [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8980.800000000001s)]
*  until I started to speak out about people like this. [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8982.08s)]
*  You know it's been a hard time to line up this interview [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8984.84s)]
*  because the last time I was scheduled to be [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8988.0s)]
*  in this interview, randomly our car got hit from the side [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8989.64s)]
*  by a blacked out vehicle with no license plate. [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8992.84s)]
*  That happened three times this month so far. [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8995.48s)]
*  Somebody didn't want me to do this interview. [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8997.72s)]
*  Like holy shit. [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=8999.279999999999s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9002.279999999999s)]
*  But put it into Grok, cyanide poisoning pneumonia. [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9003.96s)]
*  Because I think it's not just him saying that [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9009.24s)]
*  or this article saying that. [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9011.32s)]
*  I think that's a real thing. [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9012.32s)]
*  Do we like Grok? [[02:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9014.679999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it's pretty good. [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9016.119999999999s)]
*  I mean, I think all of them are dependent [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9017.08s)]
*  upon the information that's out. [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9018.84s)]
*  So the problem. [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9020.439999999999s)]
*  The danger is that people are only. [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9021.320000000002s)]
*  Like if I'm on X and there'll be a story, [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9022.960000000001s)]
*  the comments underneath are all saying, [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9026.400000000001s)]
*  is this true at Grok? [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9028.320000000002s)]
*  Right, right. Or whatever. [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9029.92s)]
*  And Grok jumps in, yeah. [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9030.76s)]
*  But like who's putting the information into Grok? [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9032.400000000001s)]
*  Well, Grok's getting the information from the entirety, [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9035.480000000001s)]
*  I believe, of the internet. [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9038.640000000001s)]
*  And some of the entirety of the internet is lies. [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9039.960000000001s)]
*  And official lies that have been accepted as truth [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9043.28s)]
*  by organizations. [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9046.36s)]
*  So that's a problem. [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9047.6s)]
*  Says these are rare and indirect connections. [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9049.04s)]
*  There's no evidence that cyanide itself [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9052.199999999999s)]
*  causes the infectious inflammatory process [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9053.44s)]
*  characteristic of pneumonia. [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9055.4s)]
*  If you are asking about a specific case or context, [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9057.4s)]
*  occupational exposure, a medical scenario, [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9060.52s)]
*  or historical incident, [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9062.64s)]
*  feel free to provide more details. [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9064.88s)]
*  And I can tailor the answer further. [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9068.199999999999s)]
*  What is the question? [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9069.48s)]
*  How did you prompt it? [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9070.32s)]
*  Does cyanide poisoning lead to pneumonia? [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9072.24s)]
*  Not directly. [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9074.44s)]
*  Could you give someone pneumonia [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9076.119999999999s)]
*  by poisoning them with cyanide? [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9079.08s)]
*  How about that? [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9080.92s)]
*  Could you give someone pneumonia? [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9083.48s)]
*  Let's see what you say about this, Grok. [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9085.32s)]
*  Pneumonia by poisoning them with cyanide. [[02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9086.76s)]
*  Good spelling, Jamie. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9091.12s)]
*  He's got one hand. [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9092.8s)]
*  I'm not mad at it. [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9093.64s)]
*  No, I was impressed by your pneumonia. [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9094.48s)]
*  Doubles, double with, but Grok will know you're dumb. [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9098.48s)]
*  Causing pneumonia, directly causing pneumonia [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9103.24s)]
*  by poisoning someone with cyanide is unlikely. [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9106.64s)]
*  The cyanide doesn't create an infectious [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9109.32s)]
*  or inflammatory condition [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9111.039999999999s)]
*  typically associated with pneumonia. [[02:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9112.279999999999s)]
*  Cyanide poisoning rapidly disrupts cellular oxygen use, [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9114.16s)]
*  leading to symptoms like respiratory distress, [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9117.64s)]
*  seizures, or unconsciousness, [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9120.48s)]
*  but it doesn't produce pathogens [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9122.84s)]
*  or cause lung inflammation characteristic of pneumonia. [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9124.64s)]
*  They could get hospital acquired pneumonia, [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9129.279999999999s)]
*  it says there, secondary complications. [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9131.44s)]
*  Aspiration pneumonia. [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9132.8s)]
*  If cyanide poisoning causes unconsciousness or seizures, [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9134.199999999999s)]
*  a person might aspirate vomit or saliva into their lungs. [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9138.12s)]
*  This can induce bacteria or irritants [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9141.84s)]
*  potentially leading to the aspiration pneumonia, [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9144.68s)]
*  a non-infectious form of the condition. [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9148.44s)]
*  So that's possible. [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9150.960000000001s)]
*  And then secondary complications. [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9151.960000000001s)]
*  The victim survives initial cyanide poisoning [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9153.320000000002s)]
*  but requires prolonged hospitalization. [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9155.36s)]
*  Mechanical ventilation or intensive care [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9157.92s)]
*  could develop hospital acquired pneumonia [[02:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9160.84s)]

*  You know, if you want people to trust you, [[02:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9279.2s)]
*  you have to say that you fucked up. [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9281.08s)]
*  And if you can't say you fucked up, [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9282.960000000001s)]

*  No one's always right. [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9288.28s)]
*  And there's a lot of times you get things wrong [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9289.44s)]
*  where you thought you were right [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9290.92s)]
*  and you can explain why you thought you were right [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9291.88s)]
*  and then people get it and they go, [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9295.4s)]
*  oh, well, he'll tell the truth. [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9296.8s)]
*  And if you don't do that, you can't do this [[02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9298.16s)]
*  because this is, it's like once you've experienced someone [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9300.4s)]
*  that is not being directed to say certain things [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9305.960000000001s)]

*  bullshitters won't work. [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9318.92s)]
*  It's not gonna work. [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9321.92s)]
*  You don't resonate. [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9323.279999999999s)]
*  You'll get a certain amount of people [[02:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9324.16s)]
*  that pay attention to you. [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9325.52s)]
*  This is a certain amount. [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9326.56s)]
*  It'll never really catch on because you're a bullshitter [[02:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9327.64s)]
*  and you can't be a bullshitter [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9331.119999999999s)]
*  and a truth teller at the same time. [[02:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9332.32s)]
*  I mean, the truth teller is like a fucking, [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9334.16s)]
*  I'm a psychic or I'm a clairvoyant. [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9336.0s)]
*  You know, it's like, it sounds like a bullshit phrase. [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9339.56s)]
*  Truth teller. [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9341.960000000001s)]
*  But you gotta decide, am I telling the truth about it? [[02:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9343.2s)]
*  Am I looking at this stuff for what I think it really is [[02:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9345.52s)]
*  and sticking my neck out and saying, I think we're wrong. [[02:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9348.0s)]
*  I think we're lied to about virtually everything. [[02:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9350.48s)]
*  And then this thing that we thought we weren't lied to, [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9354.2s)]
*  turns out we were lied to about that as well. [[02:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9356.88s)]
*  So it's like, it's not like this one thing [[02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9358.72s)]
*  that they lied about, [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9360.8s)]
*  that everything else has been the truth. [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9361.76s)]
*  No, it's every fucking thing. [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9363.2s)]
*  But yet this one thing is the holdout. [[02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9365.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9367.76s)]
*  You know? [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9368.6s)]
*  But not this one here. [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9369.44s)]
*  Not this one. [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9370.26s)]
*  That's why I always say, [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9371.74s)]
*  when people are trying to criticize me, go ahead. [[02:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9373.1s)]
*  But just so everybody can put you in the right context, [[02:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9375.800000000001s)]
*  just list your vac status. [[02:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9378.380000000001s)]
*  How many times have you been vac-ed? [[02:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9380.460000000001s)]
*  Just so people know what fucking place you're coming from. [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9381.82s)]
*  Right, did you get four or five? [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9383.78s)]
*  Did you go crazy and get all nine? [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9386.380000000001s)]
*  But that's the thing, if you're not controlled, [[02:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9388.34s)]
*  if you're not controlled, if you're not bought and paid for, [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9390.74s)]
*  if you don't have people you have to, like you. [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9393.02s)]
*  Like if Spotify was saying, hey Joe, [[02:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9395.58s)]
*  we love what you're doing, we're gonna give you all this money, [[02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9399.02s)]
*  but you gotta stay in this lane over here, [[02:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9401.22s)]
*  just so we don't upset anybody. [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9404.26s)]
*  But you're not. [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9406.26s)]
*  And that's why people didn't like the fact [[02:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9407.1s)]
*  that you had all these different people on, [[02:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9409.14s)]
*  from all walks of life and all sides of the aisles, [[02:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9410.58s)]
*  because there's too much information out there [[02:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9413.52s)]
*  that might influence somebody. [[02:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9415.779999999999s)]
*  Think about things a little bit differently. [[02:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9417.38s)]

*  You're not controlled. [[02:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9420.18s)]
*  Well, not only that, but if I didn't go to Spotify, [[02:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9421.199999999999s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9425.539999999999s)]
*  Like if I was just independent like I was before, [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9426.38s)]
*  and just on YouTube, a lot of people got pulled [[02:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9429.1s)]
*  from YouTube for far less, [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9430.86s)]

*  When all of those conversations were being taken place [[02:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9439.34s)]
*  and people were freaking out, [[02:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9441.78s)]
*  that was a time where I was only on Spotify. [[02:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9443.1s)]
*  And that was huge. [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9446.86s)]
*  Thank God, people needed to hear that. [[02:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9448.980000000001s)]
*  Yeah, because if you weren't out there doing it, [[02:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9451.62s)]
*  who was gonna fucking do it? [[02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9453.380000000001s)]
*  But that's where I gotta give Spotify props. [[02:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9454.26s)]
*  Because they got a lot of pressure. [[02:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9456.94s)]
*  They got a lot of pressure to yank me. [[02:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9458.859999999999s)]
*  When Neil Young and Joni Mitchell were, [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9460.9s)]
*  I get it, they're old. [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9463.9s)]

*  Okay. [[02:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9479.98s)]
*  But these people still, probably to this day, [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9480.8s)]
*  will tell you that vaccines save millions of lives. [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9483.279999999999s)]

*  You've been lied to. [[02:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9490.1s)]
*  Maybe they save some lives. [[02:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9491.36s)]
*  But I don't know what the number is. [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9493.1s)]
*  They also cause some problems. [[02:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9494.54s)]
*  This is like reality. [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9496.380000000001s)]
*  We shouldn't look at one part of reality, [[02:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9498.08s)]
*  because it suits our narrative. [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9500.060000000001s)]
*  And this is what people are doing. [[02:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9501.54s)]
*  They're just shoving their fucking head in the sand. [[02:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9502.86s)]
*  Like, yeah, for some people, [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9504.460000000001s)]
*  vaccines probably prevented them from getting measles. [[02:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9506.28s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9508.86s)]
*  It seems like they work. [[02:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9510.26s)]
*  It's not like they don't work at all. [[02:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9511.44s)]

*  We should be able to look at all these things. [[02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9515.580000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9517.460000000001s)]

*  Informed consent is you know what the possibilities are. [[02:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9520.34s)]
*  Not that they've been lying to you and gaslighting you [[02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9523.04s)]
*  so that the doctor gets more incentives. [[02:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9525.220000000001s)]
*  Maybe they have. [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9527.660000000002s)]
*  Right. [[02:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9528.7s)]
*  But this is the thing. [[02:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9529.54s)]
*  Like, you should have, [[02:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9530.820000000002s)]
*  your decision should be based entirely on that, [[02:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9531.84s)]
*  not the influence of a doctor who is incentivized. [[02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9534.580000000002s)]
*  And you should know, [[02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9537.5s)]
*  Mr. and Mrs. who are about to have a child, [[02:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9538.900000000001s)]
*  just so you know, this doctor gets a kickback [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9541.78s)]
*  should you get the full 72, 75 vaccine schedules. [[02:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9544.42s)]
*  I don't think it's really 72. [[02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9548.78s)]
*  I think it's like, is it 72 actual injections? [[02:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9550.3s)]
*  Or is a bunch of different things mixed together? [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9553.02s)]
*  Like the MMR, they count that as three. [[02:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9555.06s)]
*  You know, it's like one of those things. [[02:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9557.14s)]
*  Okay, well whatever the number is. [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9558.3s)]
*  Whatever the number is. [[02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9559.14s)]
*  I mean, any of them. [[02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9559.98s)]
*  But how about the ones that- [[02:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9560.82s)]
*  Let's say it's one. [[02:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9561.66s)]
*  How about the ones that are indefensible? [[02:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9562.5s)]

*  What are you doing? [[02:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9565.26s)]
*  Why would you even do that? [[02:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9566.3s)]
*  If it has side effects and you're giving it to a baby [[02:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=9567.3s)]

*  These are all good things. [[02:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10588.0s)]
*  And what it does is it turns it back into a meritocracy. [[02:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10588.64s)]
*  Yes. [[02:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10591.08s)]
*  Which is what we need. [[02:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10591.72s)]
*  Yes. [[02:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10592.56s)]
*  But we also have to address as a community, as a country, and this is [[02:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10593.84s)]
*  something that never gets talked about enough, there's places that are fucked [[02:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10600.72s)]
*  and they're not going to unfuck themselves. [[02:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10604.4s)]
*  And if you're talking about Baltimore or the South Side of Chicago or any of these [[02:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10606.8s)]
*  cities that have experienced the exact same environment for generation after [[02:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10611.16s)]
*  generation of crime and poverty, that needs to be addressed. [[02:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10616.599999999999s)]
*  And that's the only way we fix the crime problem in this country. [[02:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10619.919999999998s)]
*  It has to be fixed from like a children level. [[02:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10622.8s)]
*  We have to stop children from growing up in these horrendous environments, [[02:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10626.039999999999s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10640.4s)]
*  It's like people that are against welfare or against social safety nets. [[02:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10640.72s)]
*  I am for all that shit, but I'm also for guidance and mentorship and examples of [[02:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10644.04s)]
*  how to live a life that's full of meaning and accomplishment. [[02:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10650.56s)]
*  And anybody can do that. [[02:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10655.08s)]
*  Anybody can do that. [[02:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10656.48s)]
*  If you can get an education, if you can get out there in the world, and if you [[02:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10657.72s)]
*  have a fucking chance of not getting indoctrinated into a fucking gang and [[02:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10662.48s)]
*  you're not forced to sell drugs, you don't get murdered when you're 15, [[02:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10666.44s)]
*  that's what we have to stop. [[02:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10670.64s)]
*  Because this is like we have untapped potential of human beings that are just [[02:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10672.240000000002s)]
*  being poisoned by an environment that's never going to change. [[02:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10676.76s)]
*  And if we don't look at it that way, you want to make America great again? [[02:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10680.28s)]
*  Have less losers. [[02:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10683.44s)]
*  The way to have less losers is give more people opportunities. [[02:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10684.92s)]
*  It doesn't mean take away opportunities from white people. [[02:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10687.400000000001s)]
*  That's a stupid way of approaching it. [[02:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10689.76s)]
*  Like stopping white men, wow, we have too many straight white men. [[02:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10691.720000000001s)]

*  Just give more opportunities to other people by boosting them up from the part [[02:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10697.68s)]
*  that's fucked is the neighborhood that they grow up in. [[02:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10703.08s)]
*  That needs to be addressed on a national scale. [[02:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10706.08s)]
*  And the right doesn't want to address it. [[02:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10708.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10710.0s)]
*  But like Thomas Sewell said, it hasn't worked just electing all Democrat [[02:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10710.720000000001s)]
*  candidates. [[02:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10715.240000000002s)]
*  What have they actually done? [[02:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10715.84s)]
*  How have they made it better since the civil rights? [[02:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10716.6s)]
*  Too many grifters. [[02:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10719.240000000002s)]
*  Too many people on the take. [[02:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10720.480000000001s)]
*  Too many people just using all those political platitudes and all of those [[02:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10721.720000000001s)]
*  beautiful ideas about equity. [[02:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10727.240000000002s)]
*  Yeah, act blues in the world. [[02:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10730.04s)]
*  All that shit, they're just lining their pockets, folks, and things aren't [[02:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10731.8s)]
*  getting better. [[02:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10735.8s)]
*  No, not at all. [[02:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10736.439999999999s)]
*  The the solution is the same solution that's everywhere. [[02:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10737.359999999999s)]
*  Like make it profitable. [[02:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10740.76s)]
*  That can be done. [[02:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10742.52s)]
*  Like you we got these no bid contracts that Halliburton got to fix Iraq after [[02:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10744.0s)]
*  we blew the fucking shit out of it. [[02:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10749.16s)]
*  And you can't have contracts for companies to profit off of going into these [[02:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10751.4s)]
*  inner cities and providing mentorship and making more of a responsible police [[02:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10756.68s)]
*  presence. [[02:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10761.72s)]
*  And then maybe some places where people can detox safely, medically, maybe some [[02:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10762.72s)]
*  education, maybe provide them with nutrition, give people job skills, figure [[02:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10769.68s)]
*  out a way like everyone's it's not going to work with everyone. [[02:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10775.08s)]
*  You're going to have a bunch of people that don't want to do it. [[02:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10778.16s)]
*  They don't want to change. [[02:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10780.0s)]
*  But there's going to be a bunch of people that are looking for something and you're [[02:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10781.0s)]
*  going to give them that something. [[02:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10784.64s)]
*  And now you've got a winner. [[02:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10786.16s)]
*  Now you've got someone who develops an education. [[02:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10787.64s)]
*  They have good mentors around them. [[02:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10789.68s)]
*  They got people that are showing them. [[02:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10791.16s)]
*  There's other ways to live life. [[02:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10792.519999999999s)]
*  If there's a concerted effort to do that, you've got massive amounts of potential [[02:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10794.08s)]
*  that's just fucked, fucked by their environment. [[02:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10798.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10801.92s)]
*  And then if you just do it once, then you have a something to look to. [[03:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10802.92s)]
*  There's your mentor. [[03:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10807.199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10808.08s)]
*  There's your that's what I want to be when I grow up. [[03:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10808.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10810.88s)]
*  I want to get out and do this. [[03:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10811.16s)]
*  Which is the inherent problem with racism and the problem with all these videos, you [[03:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10812.6s)]
*  see of black people doing wild things online. [[03:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10817.08s)]
*  It's like, yeah, you're looking at that, but you're also not looking at the environment [[03:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10819.96s)]
*  and these people are forced to exist in. [[03:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10824.6s)]
*  And what would you be like if you were in that environment? [[03:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10827.08s)]
*  You'd be the same way. [[03:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10829.359999999999s)]
*  We'd all be the same way. [[03:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10830.4s)]
*  The constant gentrification of those areas isn't helping. [[03:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10831.24s)]
*  It's not helping. [[03:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10833.68s)]
*  Just making them more concentrated. [[03:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10834.439999999999s)]

*  in agreement. [[03:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10849.48s)]

*  And Andrew Yang talked about that a long time ago. [[03:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10857.88s)]
*  That's not a bad thing, though, I think. [[03:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10861.039999999999s)]
*  But when you're totally dependent on the state, that's totally dependent and you don't have [[03:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10862.52s)]

*  And there's always going to be people that are go-getters. [[03:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10875.76s)]
*  There's always going to be people in this world that want more. [[03:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10878.119999999999s)]

*  pulled off and realize that they can ask more of themselves. [[03:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj_dO-7Ct_4&t=10904.76s)]
