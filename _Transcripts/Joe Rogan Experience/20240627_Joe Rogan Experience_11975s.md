# Joe Rogan Experience #1962 - Eddie Huang
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day! [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6.0s)]
*  What up man? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10.0s)]
*  Good to see you my friend, what's cracking? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=14.0s)]
*  Been forever, I feel 2017 I think was the last time. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=16.0s)]
*  Well I have to go back and check, but was the last time that I saw you on the podcast, was that the last time I saw you? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=19.0s)]
*  I think it was, we came with like a voting expert before the election, like it might have been like 2017. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=25.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=33.0s)]
*  I think, cause we did hot yoga then I came back on the show. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=34.0s)]
*  Yeah, we did hot yoga for your show, that was fun. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=37.0s)]
*  That was dope. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=40.0s)]
*  That was fun, that was fun. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=41.0s)]
*  Then Vice ran out of money and you know, couldn't do the show anymore. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=43.0s)]
*  Well somebody got money, didn't Shane Smith make a fucking ton of loot? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=47.0s)]
*  Shane's a man. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=51.0s)]
*  Yeah, I love that dude. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=52.0s)]
*  I still talk to Shane, but no it was, I think the end of Wongs World was just, they were like, yo we still want to do Wongs World, but can we make it domestic? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=53.0s)]
*  And I wanted to do films and I was just like, love you, I'ma go make this film. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=61.0s)]
*  So they wanted to do it in the United States because of travel costs? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=67.0s)]
*  Yeah, and just cause it's Viceland the first couple years it was just, the accounting was off. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=70.0s)]
*  People were just spending money crazy. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=78.0s)]
*  Bro, it started out, they would take these guys with glasses on, these nerds, and send them over to like the middle of a goddamn war zone. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=81.0s)]
*  These dudes would be filming with a flak jacket on and bombs are blowing off in the Middle East and they're just reporting there. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=89.0s)]
*  You're like, whoa, Vice is wild. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=94.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was the best cause Vice would just pick the most dangerous shit and be like, here's $30,000, go with a like, you know, 5D camera and fucking come back with some footage and try not to die. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=96.0s)]
*  And then once it became the TV channel, it got crazy cause I mean I was probably the biggest perpetrator. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=110.0s)]
*  So like in all fairness to Shane, somebody needed to be like, Eddie, you're burning money crazy. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=116.0s)]
*  Cause I was going to like F1 tracks and I literally the last episode I went on an F1 track in Abu Dhabi and Shane was there and he's like, what are you doing here? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=122.0s)]
*  You're a fucking food show. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=132.0s)]
*  And I was like, I don't know, I got to drive this car. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=134.0s)]
*  It's like getting caught by your boss. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=136.0s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=140.0s)]
*  I'm here to try Formula One food, bro. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=141.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=143.0s)]
*  I was like, I'm going to try the concessions. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=144.0s)]
*  Dude, they sent David Cho to the Congo to look for a dinosaur. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=146.0s)]
*  Have you ever seen that? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=150.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's the most ridiculous shit of all time. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=153.0s)]
*  It might be the greatest Vice episode ever. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=156.0s)]
*  Bro, it's an amazing episode. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=158.0s)]
*  That in Haimo's Arctic Adventure. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=160.0s)]
*  That's my favorite one. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=163.0s)]
*  That's the one about that dude who lives in Alaska. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=164.0s)]
*  He's subsistence survives in this very small cabin. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=167.0s)]
*  He's the last person that's allowed to own this cabin in this wilderness. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=170.0s)]
*  I haven't seen it. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=174.0s)]
*  Whoo, that one's heavy. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=175.0s)]
*  That's heavy. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=177.0s)]
*  But that show episodes the best because there's so many people now, especially in LA that are like for a honeymoon or like for the holidays. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=178.0s)]
*  I'm going to go to the Congo. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=186.0s)]
*  I want to I want to go to West Africa. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=187.0s)]
*  And I'm just like, bro, watch that episode real quick. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=189.0s)]
*  Yeah, watch that episode. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=192.0s)]
*  That's not where you're staying, but it's close to where you're trying to go. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=193.0s)]
*  Like, check, check that episode out. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=196.0s)]
*  You're in the middle of a conflict zone. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=197.0s)]
*  It's very dangerous being down there. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=199.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=201.0s)]
*  It's just. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=202.0s)]
*  And probably no dinosaurs. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=203.0s)]
*  No, there's probably no dinosaurs. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=206.0s)]
*  I want to go to Ethiopia, but I'm not going with Cho. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=208.0s)]
*  Wherever Cho went, I'm like, I'm not going there. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=211.0s)]
*  David's wild, man. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=213.0s)]
*  He went when he camped with the Hadza. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=214.0s)]
*  He stayed with the Hadza and went hunting with them. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=217.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=219.0s)]
*  He was saying that when they shot, they were shooting baboons to eat. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=220.0s)]
*  And he said, it's crazy when they shoot a baboon, it grabs the arrow. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=224.0s)]
*  And like you see it grabbed out. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=227.0s)]
*  That's a little too weird. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=229.0s)]
*  You know, Cho was really putting himself in danger. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=232.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. I was like I was more like the Vanderpump show. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=236.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, I was like, let's have a nice, lovely Abu Dhabi. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=240.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=244.0s)]
*  Let's live it up. People. Beautiful land. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=245.0s)]
*  Yeah. Have a good time. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=247.0s)]
*  See some fucking people here. Have a good time. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=249.0s)]
*  Stay in a nice hotel. Yeah. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=251.0s)]
*  I chose like the opposite of conflict zones. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=253.0s)]
*  You know, I haven't been I've been to Dubai once. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=256.0s)]
*  I was there in there was a UFC in Abu Dhabi and we did the Wayans in Dubai. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=259.0s)]
*  And that was the only time I've ever been there. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=265.0s)]
*  But I was like, wow, this place is crazy. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=266.0s)]
*  But everybody I know that goes over there says like, you can't even believe what you're looking. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=268.0s)]
*  There's no crime. And it's just like massive city. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=272.0s)]
*  And it's all everything's like opulent and beautiful. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=276.0s)]
*  And and and people are moving there just because it's an amazing place to live. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=279.0s)]
*  Yeah. But the funny thing is, I'm just like, how long is this thing going to last? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=283.0s)]
*  Because they're like importing water for like plumbing. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=287.0s)]
*  You know, how are they doing that? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=291.0s)]
*  I mean, I think they're just stealing water from everywhere. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=293.0s)]
*  Like we steal like we steal water, you know, but it's like the water. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=296.0s)]
*  I have no idea. I didn't look into it. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=300.0s)]
*  But it's like all the workers are brought in all the waters brought in like they don't. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=303.0s)]
*  It's like in the middle of nowhere in the desert. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=307.0s)]
*  It's Daniel Day-Lewis. I drink your milkshake. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=309.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=312.0s)]
*  But I love Dubai. Dubai was a great time. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=314.0s)]
*  It's beautiful over there. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=317.0s)]
*  At least the small amount of it I saw. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=319.0s)]
*  Vice had a very disturbing piece about them back in the day, too, about the construction. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=321.0s)]
*  Yes. The migrant workers. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=327.0s)]
*  They need to do like a sex worker special in Dubai, too, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=330.0s)]
*  because the stories I hear from like the the people who have gone there for some work, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=333.0s)]
*  like shitting in buckets, dog. Oh, like shitting, shitting in buckets in Dubai. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=338.0s)]
*  I feel like that would be a good title of a doc. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=344.0s)]
*  Shitting in buckets in Dubai. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=348.0s)]
*  That's what's so fascinating about people that there's people that are living at the like the top of luxury [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=352.0s)]
*  at the same time people are living on dirt floors with no electricity in a shack that they built out of scraps. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=361.0s)]
*  Just trying to figure out how to eat that day and that there's more of those people than there are the people living in luxury. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=370.0s)]
*  But if you look at any kind of billboards and advertisement, depictions, depictions of life, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=376.0s)]
*  it's almost always the luxury one. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=382.0s)]
*  It's always the person like with the fucking fantastic view of the ocean behind them when they're eating their breakfast at some luxury five star resort. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=385.0s)]
*  Like that's what people look towards. Yeah. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=393.0s)]
*  But it's all existing simultaneously. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=396.0s)]
*  And then the guy that's actually living the luxurious life, not the actor on the billboard, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=398.0s)]
*  he's like painting an escort to shit in a bucket and then fucking eat it with a caviar spoon. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=402.0s)]
*  No! Yeah, bro. That's what I'm talking about. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=407.0s)]
*  I thought they didn't have bathrooms. No. I didn't understand you were saying shit in a bucket because that's a kink. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=410.0s)]
*  Yeah, like put your fucking clear heels on and shit in this bucket. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=415.0s)]
*  Bro. Yeah. How much does a girl get paid for something like that? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=422.0s)]
*  Jamie just made a noise. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=426.0s)]
*  I'm going to plead ignorance. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=429.0s)]
*  Yeah, out of all the acts that you would have someone do, imagine like that's your thing. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=433.0s)]
*  Yeah. I would really like to watch you take a shit in a bucket. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=439.0s)]
*  Really? Yeah. Just like let's see what you had for lunch. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=442.0s)]
*  Is that Terry Black's barbecue in there? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=448.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=450.0s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=454.0s)]
*  It just goes all the way around, man. You get to the top, you get rich, and then I think you just want to eat like, I don't know. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=455.0s)]
*  Different jobs that suck, but anytime you're dealing with human shit, that's like as far on the bad side of the spectrum as is possible. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=461.0s)]
*  If you are interacting with other people's shit, like, ooh, that's not a good job. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=471.0s)]
*  Yeah, and human shit is different than like dog shit. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=475.0s)]
*  Oh, way different. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=477.0s)]
*  There's some like, dog shit, I'm like, all right, I had to pick up human shit once and I was like, bro, this is fucking crazy. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=478.0s)]
*  It's too close to home, man. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=486.0s)]
*  Bro, our diets are terrible. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=488.0s)]
*  I mean, dogs, most of the time they're just eating dog food. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=490.0s)]
*  What's interesting about a dog is if you give a dog something other than what it's accustomed to eating, they get diarrhea. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=494.0s)]
*  Have you ever had to pick up another human shit? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=500.0s)]
*  Other than my kids when they were little, you know, you have to clean their diaper and sometimes there's a mess. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=503.0s)]
*  No, I don't think so. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=510.0s)]
*  It's interesting when it's your child, though, when it's a child, like, it's like it doesn't even phase you. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=512.0s)]
*  It's like it's you. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=517.0s)]
*  It's like it's you. It's like cleaning your own shit. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=518.0s)]
*  It's really interesting. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=520.0s)]
*  It's like, you know, if someone was right next to you on an airplane, they were changing a baby diaper, which has happened to me before. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=521.0s)]
*  You're like, yo, like you kind of look away like this. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=527.0s)]
*  Well, and this little baby's assholes all fucking covered in poop. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=532.0s)]
*  You know, it's just like, OK, what you got to do? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=536.0s)]
*  Like, I get it. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=539.0s)]
*  You got to change. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=540.0s)]
*  But if it's your kid, it's weird. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=541.0s)]
*  It's like it doesn't seem even like like, you know, you take a shit. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=543.0s)]
*  It's very rare that I take a shit and I'm like, Jesus Christ, let me get out of here. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=546.0s)]
*  What the fuck is that smell? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=550.0s)]
*  Like maybe once every three or four months. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=551.0s)]
*  Yeah. Most of the time I take a shit, it's normal. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=553.0s)]
*  I just flush it. It's normal. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=555.0s)]
*  That's what it's like when it's a kid's shit. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=556.0s)]
*  It's like it doesn't even say gross. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=558.0s)]
*  I think I'm once a month stinky. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=560.0s)]
*  Like once a month, I'm like, once a month. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=562.0s)]
*  Don't try that recipe again. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=565.0s)]
*  It's usually when I feel like a rumble before I know I have to take a shit like, Jesus, what is that? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=568.0s)]
*  OK, I better get in there. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=572.0s)]
*  And then when you get in there, just whoa. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=573.0s)]
*  And whatever that rumble is, is probably some gases that have been stewing up inside of your bowels. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=576.0s)]
*  No, I knew I really loved my wife because one day I had to pick up her shit. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=583.0s)]
*  And I was like, bro, picking up adult adult human shit is fucking like babies. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=587.0s)]
*  I get it. Yeah. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=592.0s)]
*  Babies, you expect it. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=593.0s)]
*  I think a lot of your reactions in life, it's about expectation. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=595.0s)]
*  Like if you're expecting to be punched in the face, it doesn't like you're not going to get it. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=600.0s)]
*  Like you're not going to get knocked out. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=602.0s)]
*  People say that's true. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=603.0s)]
*  You see it coming. You won't get knocked out. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=605.0s)]
*  Well, sometimes you still get knocked out. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=606.0s)]
*  Depends on how hard somebody hits you. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=608.0s)]
*  Like if Francis Ngannou hits you in the face. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=610.0s)]
*  Yeah, I would be knocked out. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=612.0s)]
*  Most of us get knocked out. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=614.0s)]
*  For sure. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=615.0s)]
*  Almost everybody. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=616.0s)]
*  For sure. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=617.0s)]
*  If it really hits you. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=618.0s)]
*  But I think if it's somebody that's like on his level and sees it coming and in a fight with him, I feel like maybe. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=619.0s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=625.0s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=626.0s)]
*  But the point is that if you don't see it, it's amazing what knocks you out. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=627.0s)]
*  Like a lot of things knock you out. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=630.0s)]
*  It could be light. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=631.0s)]
*  Yeah, it just has to hit you clean. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=632.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=634.0s)]
*  That's what happened. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=635.0s)]
*  My girl had like a crazy food poisoning moment. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=636.0s)]
*  And then she was like, yo, Eddie, come downstairs. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=639.0s)]
*  I was like, what? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=643.0s)]
*  And she was like, I shit on the floor. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=645.0s)]
*  And it turned out, like I can't tell the whole story because she's got to tell it one day. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=648.0s)]
*  But like it turned out it wasn't food poisoning. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=654.0s)]
*  She had a much more serious like health condition situation. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=657.0s)]
*  But like I turned when she's like, I shit on the floor and I saw like a little Hershey kiss. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=661.0s)]
*  I'm like, all right. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=666.0s)]
*  Like it's still weird. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=667.0s)]
*  You didn't make it to the bathroom. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=669.0s)]
*  But like that's not bad. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=671.0s)]
*  If you love her, it's a good test. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=673.0s)]
*  Yeah, I picked it up. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=675.0s)]
*  Whatever. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=676.0s)]
*  I picked it up. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=677.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=678.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=679.0s)]
*  You have to do it every day. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=680.0s)]
*  Get tired or something though. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=681.0s)]
*  No. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=682.0s)]
*  She just she started testing your boundaries. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=683.0s)]
*  Amber Heard style. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=684.0s)]
*  Start shit in your bed. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=685.0s)]
*  And then they also did something with Taco Bell. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=686.0s)]
*  There was something about Amber Heard and Taco Bell. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=689.0s)]
*  And I can't remember. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=691.0s)]
*  I guarantee you that's a boundary testing maneuver. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=692.0s)]
*  If I had a guess, you know, I would guess. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=696.0s)]
*  See, that's what I thought at first too. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=699.0s)]
*  I was like, you're testing me. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=700.0s)]
*  This is you're doing those things. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=702.0s)]
*  But it wasn't. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=704.0s)]
*  I pick up this Hershey kiss and then I'm like, all right, that's not bad. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=705.0s)]
*  I'll do it. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=708.0s)]
*  I'm just going to play along. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=709.0s)]
*  You got food poisoning. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=710.0s)]
*  I turn and there is a giant pile of shit in my like pajama pants, these redskins pajama pants. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=711.0s)]
*  And I was like, ah, I just like jumped and screamed like, what's going on? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=717.0s)]
*  She's like, I told you I shit on the floor. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=720.0s)]
*  She's like, aren't you glad I shit in the pajama pants instead of the floor? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=722.0s)]
*  And I was like, yeah. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=725.0s)]
*  And then I like wrapped it like lotus leaf sticky rice and just ran to the garbage can. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=727.0s)]
*  You didn't wash it out? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=731.0s)]
*  No. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=732.0s)]
*  Are they your favorite pajamas? [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=733.0s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=734.0s)]
*  The pajamas got to go. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=735.0s)]
*  Once your girl takes a shit in your pants, they got to go. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=736.0s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=739.0s)]
*  I'm going to clean them and go, hey, baby, remember these? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=740.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=742.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=743.0s)]
*  These are my favorites. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=744.0s)]
*  It's horny time. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=745.0s)]
*  You shit all over them. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=746.0s)]
*  It's horny time. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=747.0s)]
*  Let's get horny. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=748.0s)]
*  I was mad at her first. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=753.0s)]
*  Then I found out girls are getting paid 60 G's to go shit in a bucket in Dubai. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=754.0s)]
*  60 G's? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=758.0s)]
*  You just dropped the number. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=759.0s)]
*  We were wondering. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=760.0s)]
*  I was like, I just threw away a $60,000 value here. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=761.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=764.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=765.0s)]
*  I think they have to be there when it happens. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=766.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=767.0s)]
*  But to the fact, it's like, you know, it's not as valuable. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=768.0s)]
*  We didn't enjoy it. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=770.64s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=771.64s)]
*  You got to also probably, part of the kink is that you're asking for it and then they [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=772.64s)]
*  do it. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=777.12s)]
*  That's probably part of the kink. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=778.12s)]
*  It's not that you just randomly saw someone take a shit. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=779.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=782.84s)]
*  You just like you ask them to do it and then they go, all right. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=783.84s)]
*  They don't even want to do it, but they do it for you because they want the money. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=785.84s)]
*  It's not isolated either. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=788.72s)]
*  I know multiple people that know multiple people that have been paid to take shits and [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=790.24s)]
*  my brother was telling me once. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=794.16s)]
*  There's dudes that are like, you're going to eat this specific shit. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=796.8000000000001s)]

*  This is Kill Cliff. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1114.0s)]
*  We gave like I think there was like seven or eight different samples that we had to go [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1115.0s)]
*  through to get to this. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1119.5600000000002s)]
*  Actually I probably got the head buzz from the black rifle. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1121.04s)]
*  That's right. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1123.64s)]

*  It's got like 23 grams of sugar. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1128.0s)]
*  But the caffeine too. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1129.0s)]
*  It's a lot of caffeine. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1130.0s)]
*  They have those big cans. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1131.0s)]
*  The big cans are 300 milligrams which is just nuts. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1132.76s)]
*  That's a lot. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1137.0s)]
*  I feel like everyone is a three bev person now. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1138.0s)]
*  Like at all times. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1141.1200000000001s)]
*  It used to just be like water, juice, coffee. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1142.1200000000001s)]
*  Now it's like oh I got this black rifle. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1144.72s)]
*  I got the CBD. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1146.32s)]
*  I got water. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1147.32s)]
*  We're greedy. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1148.32s)]
*  Our empire is falling. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1149.32s)]
*  I want coffee, a glass of wine, and a bottle of water. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1150.32s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1152.2s)]
*  Squeeze juice. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1153.2s)]
*  Whatever I want. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1154.2s)]
*  I'm going to be here for a while. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1155.2s)]
*  I want different things to try. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1156.2s)]
*  We're a failing empire. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1157.44s)]
*  The empire is definitely failing. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1159.44s)]
*  If you watch at all levels, especially what's really funny with the Fed thing now is that [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1160.88s)]
*  they want to fight inflation but then they just threw billions of dollars back into the [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1167.24s)]
*  market and I'm like inflation is going to go crazy. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1171.56s)]
*  I don't see a way where this levels out and becomes something that we can all say is like [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1177.04s)]
*  a reasonable system. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1182.2s)]
*  No. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1183.68s)]
*  That's what scares the shit out of me. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1185.16s)]
*  I think all the pricing is out of whack. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1187.28s)]
*  It's going to stay out of whack because the economy just wants to keep going and it won't [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1189.1200000000001s)]
*  stop. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1193.8s)]
*  That's what's wild about growth. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1194.8s)]
*  Like constant never ending growth. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1197.28s)]
*  Just bigger, bigger. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1201.24s)]
*  It's kind of wild that all corporations kind of operate on that mentality. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1202.24s)]
*  Like if you're a shareholder for whatever company it is, like a really successful company [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1206.76s)]
*  like Apple, you want them to do better next quarter. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1212.48s)]
*  Like hey, you guys should be doing better. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1215.08s)]
*  You have to do better. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1216.48s)]
*  This company is worth like fucking eight trillion dollars. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1219.1599999999999s)]
*  We're like, come on guys. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1221.6s)]
*  I need these fucking prices to come up. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1224.36s)]
*  People are playing this weird gambling game with your value and your popularity. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1227.12s)]
*  It's very strange that we all think that everything should keep growing and grow forever. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1232.3999999999999s)]
*  I think human self interest and human nature to like want to compete and want to grow and [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1238.8s)]
*  want to get better. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1244.64s)]
*  But I'm waiting for the next like great economist because I do feel like everything is still [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1245.92s)]
*  just like Adam Smith, wealth of nations. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1251.28s)]
*  And it's like there's been Marxism, there's been other things, but nothing has topped [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1254.0800000000002s)]
*  that guy's like idea for the global economy. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1259.16s)]
*  And I think somebody has to come around that is not anti-growth, but like really like, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1263.66s)]
*  all right, looking at nature, looking at resources, looking at like war, like what is the reasonable [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1270.18s)]
*  amount of growth we can have? [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1275.8000000000002s)]
*  Just like working out, right? [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1277.88s)]
*  You know, like you have the trainers that are just like fucking do 70 exercises and [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1278.98s)]
*  fucking all these reps and yada yada. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1283.26s)]
*  But I actually do better with the trainers that are like, hey, let's work hard for 45 [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1285.74s)]
*  minutes. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1289.66s)]
*  Rest, recovery, focus on recovery. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1290.66s)]
*  How much can you do? [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1293.4s)]
*  How much can you push your body? [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1294.4s)]
*  Like I think that's the type of guy we need or girl to like have a new philosophy for [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1295.5600000000002s)]
*  the global economy. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1301.0400000000002s)]
*  The problem is relying on any one person is a crazy idea. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1302.68s)]
*  Yeah, not relying, but like to have the idea. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1306.0s)]
*  To have like a vision. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1309.68s)]
*  Yeah, that would be nice. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1311.68s)]
*  But I feel like one of the problems, excuse me, one of the problems with our system is [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1313.24s)]
*  that we're always looking for a leader. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1318.6000000000001s)]
*  Because this person comes in, they're a president for four years and then they have to try again [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1321.44s)]
*  and then they get it for eight years. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1326.44s)]
*  So when they come in, they come to the most important job in the world, but they're new, [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1327.52s)]
*  they're noobs. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1331.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1332.72s)]
*  You know, I mean, you've done a lot of different things, right? [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1333.72s)]
*  And you could speak to this when you first start doing a thing, you're like kind of got [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1335.8400000000001s)]
*  to figure it out. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1340.3600000000001s)]
*  But if it's the most important job in the world with international consequences and [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1341.3600000000001s)]
*  nuclear war rides on it and the economy rides on it and pandemic response and international [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1347.7s)]
*  relations at a porous border, and you just come into the job new. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1353.46s)]
*  Yeah, you just come in. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1357.78s)]
*  As soon as you come in, they're already thinking about reelection. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1360.46s)]
*  Yeah, immediately. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1362.98s)]
*  Yeah, they're like, you think he'll run in 2024? [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1363.98s)]
*  Oh, sleepy Joe? [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1366.78s)]
*  No, I mean, that's what they say. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1368.98s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1371.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1372.02s)]
*  I really think the reelecting of people, we need longer terms. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1373.1s)]
*  But then also, I wouldn't sign up for that until we really get a hold of the like the [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1378.62s)]
*  S-PAC shit and the like gerrymandering because the whole system is just really broken right [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1384.7s)]
*  now. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1390.62s)]
*  The systems are very broken. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1391.62s)]
*  They need to figure out a way to get money out of it. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1392.62s)]
*  And it's too late because you can't get money out of it because money is the whole thing. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1394.5s)]
*  It's like the special interest groups and all the donors. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1398.94s)]
*  Like there's so much money moving around. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1401.42s)]
*  And then when people leave office, they get these fucking cushy speaking gigs. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1403.98s)]
*  Eddie, get in on some of that money. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1407.8200000000002s)]
*  Obama trading being the president for being an influencer is the most comedic shit ever. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1410.6200000000001s)]
*  I'm like, who the fuck needs your playlist? [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1416.22s)]
*  Like I love I loved Obama. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1418.74s)]
*  I like I was the first one to print Obama t-shirts and support him. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1420.38s)]
*  Once he was in office, I didn't I didn't I feel like he didn't come through on a lot [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1425.0600000000002s)]
*  of the things. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1429.22s)]
*  He came through on a lot of things, but I think Putin spoke to that. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1430.26s)]
*  Putin Putin spoke to these guys all have these ideas until they get into office. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1432.78s)]
*  Then the real people who run the country have a conversation with them. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1436.26s)]
*  He goes, they come in suits like mine, but with black ties and they tell them they are [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1438.58s)]
*  not doing anything. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1443.98s)]
*  And I think that's happened to every single president, except Trump was like Trump actually [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1445.78s)]
*  like fought back against the intelligence agencies, like went to war with them, which [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1451.64s)]
*  is very crazy. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1455.22s)]
*  That was crazy. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1456.22s)]
*  That's so crazy that he did that. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1457.54s)]
*  As far as like a representative of the United States, who better than Obama? [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1460.26s)]
*  He was the best of all time, the best of all time. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1464.22s)]
*  The best. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1466.78s)]
*  He's the most educated and eloquent and even keeled. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1467.78s)]
*  And he was a statesman. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1471.14s)]
*  And the way he spoke inspired confidence that truly the wisest amongst us is the king. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1473.1s)]
*  That's what we want. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1480.02s)]
*  And then that's what you realize is like what you're voting for as president is not actually [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1480.82s)]
*  a get it done person. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1485.74s)]
*  It's a figurehead, just like the Queen of England. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1487.5400000000002s)]
*  It would be nice if they were both. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1489.8200000000002s)]
*  But the thing is, I don't think they get to be. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1492.7800000000002s)]
*  I don't think they'll ever tell the truth, but I bet Obama as a lawyer in Chicago, when [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1495.5800000000002s)]
*  he gets into the office, there's probably like a real part of him that didn't know how [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1501.66s)]
*  it was all behind the scenes. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1506.8200000000002s)]
*  I don't think they let anybody know until you get in there. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1508.8200000000002s)]
*  I don't think it's, why would they? [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1511.42s)]
*  Why would they? [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1513.5800000000002s)]
*  I think they explained to you. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1514.5800000000002s)]
*  They sit you down and show you some fucking horrific facts about the world and show you [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1515.62s)]
*  what we're trying to stop and what's currently going on all over the place. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1522.3799999999999s)]
*  And here's what happens if this goes down. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1526.3799999999999s)]
*  Here's what happens if that goes down. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1528.62s)]
*  We have to be careful of this. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1529.98s)]
*  We have people in here. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1531.26s)]
*  We have people that infiltrated this group. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1532.34s)]
*  I mean, somebody wrote this on Twitter. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1534.54s)]
*  There's more FBI informants in the Proud Boys than there are Proud Boys. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1537.8999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1542.7800000000002s)]
*  I actually, you know, I choose to live in America. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1543.7800000000002s)]
*  I really prefer this because since I saw you, I lived for a year in Taiwan during the pandemic. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1547.5800000000002s)]
*  And by the end of my stay there, I was like, I really, really, I prefer to live in America. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1552.38s)]
*  What was the major difference? [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1558.46s)]
*  The major difference to me was that socially, just the way you interact socially with your [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1560.6200000000001s)]
*  lifestyle in Asia, it's significantly more conservative than the West. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1567.9399999999998s)]
*  Right? [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1573.4599999999998s)]
*  Like there's so much more group think, there's so much more peer pressure. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1574.4599999999998s)]
*  Everybody roles in groups. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1578.6599999999999s)]
*  And it's just like, you're not really an individual even within the groups. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1580.06s)]
*  And then people want you to like subscribe to this. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1585.1s)]
*  You can't hang out with everybody. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1588.3s)]
*  You got to be like part of this group or that group. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1589.58s)]
*  And then that's a cultural thing. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1592.8999999999999s)]
*  I think it was very cultural. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1594.58s)]
*  And I also just think the EQ in Asia is very rule-based when it comes to like emotional [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1596.14s)]
*  intelligence. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1603.22s)]
*  Like we have very, very specific manners. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1604.74s)]
*  Like the youngest person is going to pour tea. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1607.7s)]
*  Your father eats first. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1610.14s)]
*  Like even in language, something very simple, which is if your mother's mom, you just be [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1611.6200000000001s)]
*  like, that's grandma. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1617.9s)]
*  In ours, the name for your mother's mom is like, la la. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1619.3400000000001s)]
*  The name for your father's mom is nai nai. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1624.46s)]
*  It's very specific and there's a hierarchy. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1627.16s)]
*  Like your father's mom is higher. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1629.9s)]
*  Your mother's mom is lower. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1632.02s)]
*  It's just to me, I'm like, yo, this is too much critical analysis of like stature. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1634.22s)]
*  And then your interactions with people are so much based on your standing in society [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1640.58s)]
*  versus theirs. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1645.74s)]
*  And everybody acts in accordance with this kind of like agreed upon status. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1647.54s)]
*  This borderline caste system. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1653.66s)]
*  And then when there isn't like racial diversity either there, it's all Asian people. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1656.0600000000002s)]
*  I was just like, this is a little too cloying for me. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1661.7s)]
*  But when I look at the government, like China as a government out there, and I was living [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1666.18s)]
*  in Taiwan, spent a lot of time in China. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1671.38s)]
*  My family, my brother still lives in China, but the Chinese government to me is much more [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1673.6200000000001s)]
*  effective than the American government. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1679.38s)]
*  If it wants to get something done, China is going to have it done in 24 hours. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1682.46s)]
*  The building may fall apart, but it'll be done. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1687.0600000000002s)]
*  But they can get things done. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1690.5s)]
*  And then I also think like, they're not a benevolent country. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1692.3600000000001s)]
*  No country is benevolent. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1697.0400000000002s)]
*  It's all a business. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1698.2600000000002s)]
*  They're competing for citizens. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1699.98s)]
*  But their type of feudalism and colonialism compared to American colonialism, I think [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1702.18s)]
*  I would prefer if I was the country being shitted on. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1709.02s)]
*  Like, America will take you over. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1712.82s)]
*  It will, it will, you know, they'll send the CIA and they'll do all those things we've [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1715.3799999999999s)]
*  seen in all the countries. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1720.02s)]
*  But China, they'll invest and then own you, which also sucks. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1722.22s)]
*  It's its own poison. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1726.34s)]
*  It's pretty clever. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1727.34s)]
*  Yeah, it's clever. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1728.34s)]
*  And I just think there's always going to be a new government and a new better deal. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1729.34s)]
*  And like, I think China is the better deal right now for a place. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1734.1399999999999s)]
*  Like a developing continent like Africa or Latin America. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1738.0s)]
*  You probably get better terms with China. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1741.68s)]
*  Yeah, they'll give you a loan that you can't pay off as opposed to sending the military. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1743.92s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1748.1200000000001s)]
*  It's like a way cleaner transaction. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1749.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1750.92s)]
*  America's like terrestrial, like cable television, television. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1751.92s)]
*  China's like, we're Netflix. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1755.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1756.44s)]
*  But then it's going to come around. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1757.44s)]
*  You got no royalties. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1758.44s)]
*  You get, you know, people are going to strike. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1759.88s)]
*  They're going to fuck you. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1762.24s)]
*  It's just, it's a new way of fucking you. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1763.24s)]
*  They're fucking you in the ear. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1764.8s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1766.56s)]
*  It's interesting. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1768.24s)]
*  Like, no one in America ever wants to think that there's another option. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1769.24s)]
*  Like America's number one. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1773.8s)]
*  We're the fuck best. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1775.28s)]
*  It's like American exceptionalism. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1776.28s)]
*  Like that idea is it's really fun. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1778.1599999999999s)]
*  People enjoy doing it. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1780.56s)]
*  It's a good, it's a good time. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1781.56s)]
*  Say we fucking, we're America. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1782.56s)]
*  We fucking rule. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1784.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1786.04s)]
*  Those are the people ruining it. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1787.04s)]
*  Because I love America, but we got to look at ourselves and get better. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1788.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1791.2s)]
*  Well, you can't just stand still. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1792.2s)]
*  We also have, we have, you know, multiple problems. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1793.24s)]
*  And there's this, this idea that it's okay to just send fucking troops all over the place [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1796.16s)]
*  and occupy these places, but it's not okay if they fuck with us. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1802.76s)]
*  It's like kind of a funny way of looking at things. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1805.92s)]
*  If you just, if you just looked at us as like an entity, you didn't, you weren't American. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1808.5600000000002s)]
*  You weren't, you weren't even human. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1813.28s)]
*  Just like what's going on over here? [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1814.8000000000002s)]
*  Oh, there's one thing like sends these metal things all over the place and dominates these [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1816.0s)]
*  areas. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1821.68s)]
*  this one spot that's nowhere near the area that they're that they're at. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1823.0s)]
*  Like, what are they doing? [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1827.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1828.0s)]
*  They're, they're a weird sort of expanded empire. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1829.0s)]
*  War is a very outdated method of like doing business. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1831.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1835.8400000000001s)]
*  That's how I feel. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1836.8400000000001s)]
*  Cause war is, it's a business. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1837.8400000000001s)]
*  They used to use cannons. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1838.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1839.8400000000001s)]
*  And then they used to use rifles and tanks. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1840.8400000000001s)]
*  And now they're like, you know what, how about we just use them fucking bank accounts? [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1842.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1846.96s)]

*  We're your ally. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1850.96s)]
*  Africa. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1852.24s)]
*  I'm your ally. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1853.24s)]
*  Greece. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1854.24s)]
*  I'm your ally. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1855.24s)]
*  But in the end, you just work for China. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1856.24s)]
*  Also they have a grip on people right now that I think we should all be very careful that [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1858.24s)]
*  we don't allow to happen here. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1862.52s)]
*  And the grip on people is a social credit score system. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1864.64s)]
*  If they, if they develop a social credit score system in American and digital currency, [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1867.3600000000001s)]
*  you're going to have a real problem. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1871.76s)]
*  Cause the people that are in control of that system are going to be the ones that tell [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1872.76s)]
*  you what to do and they're going to dictate life. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1876.32s)]
*  How, how on their own terms and what's beneficial to them and the ruling class, the people that [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1879.1999999999998s)]
*  are in control. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1883.8s)]
*  And that's a scary twisted thing that could really happen, especially with all these banks [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1885.1599999999999s)]
*  collapsing and all those fucking FTX, uh, fucking shenanigans with crypto. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1890.04s)]
*  That would be very bad. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1896.24s)]
*  Can you explain? [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1897.6799999999998s)]
*  I actually, I don't think I'm grasping the social, like you mean like raiding us social. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1898.6799999999998s)]
*  So they talked about connecting it to a vaccine passport, right? [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1902.9199999999998s)]
*  People push back against that very hard. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1907.6s)]
*  And the idea would be that if you didn't do this thing, you would not get a passport that [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1909.1999999999998s)]
*  would allow you to go places. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1915.3999999999999s)]
*  And you could eventually roll that into a credit score system and say, I go through [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1917.8799999999999s)]
*  your tweets and like Eddie tweets a lot of bad shit about this. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1924.6s)]
*  Eddie, I don't like what Eddie's feelings are about pharmaceutical drug companies being [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1928.84s)]
*  responsible for the opioid crisis. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1933.56s)]
*  This makes me uncomfortable that he wants to get really political about, you know, Rand [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1935.36s)]
*  Paul grilling Dr. Fauci about gain of function research. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1940.6s)]
*  Like who the fuck is his Eddie Wong guy and what is he doing? [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1944.12s)]
*  Like, why is he doing that? [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1946.6399999999999s)]
*  Give him a strike against his social credit score system. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1948.3999999999999s)]
*  And then you go to travel, you like go to the airport and try to buy a credit, you know, [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1951.0s)]
*  a ticket online. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1955.28s)]
*  Like, I'm sorry, you can't buy a ticket. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1956.28s)]
*  You have a low credit score system or you're getting a job in the system. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1958.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1961.4399999999998s)]
*  We're getting a job. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1962.4399999999998s)]
*  In some ways, we have a version of that now, right? [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1963.52s)]
*  Like if you're a felon, you can't get a job. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1966.0800000000002s)]
*  That's the worst credit score system that we have. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1968.52s)]
*  Like you were a violent felon, you can't get a job. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1970.96s)]
*  It's hard. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1973.24s)]
*  Or you can't own a gun or you can't vote. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1974.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1976.52s)]
*  So we do have a version of that now that we reserve for people that we incarcerate. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1977.52s)]
*  I mean, it's eventually going to happen. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1983.8s)]
*  But yeah, in a way, too, it's just you can look at people's social media and I guess [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1986.2s)]
*  you make your own judgment, but a government score would be fucking crazy. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1991.12s)]
*  I think it's possible, man. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1996.28s)]
*  I think that's what China does. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1997.8799999999999s)]
*  And China does have a system set up where if someone's politically active, if they do [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=1999.8s)]
*  something, if they're involved in some protests or something like that, they'll find themselves [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2005.12s)]
*  in a position where they can't travel. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2009.04s)]
*  It's true. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2010.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2011.6799999999998s)]
*  That's where I think China has to budge is their crackdowns on society are... [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2012.6799999999998s)]
*  It's just too heavy handed and archaic. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2020.72s)]
*  It's like beating your children. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2023.32s)]
*  Nobody budges. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2025.04s)]
*  Nobody goes backwards. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2026.04s)]
*  But they did budge. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2027.04s)]
*  Really? [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2028.04s)]
*  They lifted the COVID shit. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2029.04s)]
*  Remember when people started protesting? [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2030.04s)]
*  Oh, but they had to do that. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2031.04s)]
*  They had to do that because they were falling apart. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2032.04s)]
*  Like what they were trying to do is try zero COVID. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2035.76s)]
*  You can't really do that. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2039.3600000000001s)]
*  It's a respiratory virus. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2040.3600000000001s)]
*  They never really contain respiratory viruses. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2041.3600000000001s)]
*  You know, unless you're completely isolated, you're going to catch it. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2044.4s)]
*  It's wild how it works. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2047.6000000000001s)]
*  I mean, they're really fascinating viruses. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2049.48s)]
*  I spent so much time over the last three years thinking about this. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2052.48s)]
*  How bizarre it is that we live with these little alien life forms that need hosts. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2057.7200000000003s)]
*  They need human hosts in order to survive. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2064.16s)]
*  And they travel from person to person and along the way they encounter some antibodies, [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2067.32s)]
*  they encounter vaccine antibodies and they adjust and adapt and become more widespread [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2071.96s)]
*  but a little softer, just a little easier to tolerate. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2078.56s)]
*  So that way it spreads even more. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2082.2s)]
*  It's really crazy that we coexist with these weird biological things like viruses. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2084.56s)]
*  It's very strange. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2091.2799999999997s)]
*  I just think life for people gets better in these really critical opportunistic moments [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2092.2799999999997s)]
*  when there's something that's like bad for business and good for people. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2098.7599999999998s)]
*  When you have a leader who's willing to bring the business to its knees and negotiate new terms. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2105.64s)]
*  Do you remember in the pandemic when LeBron walked out of a basketball game? [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2112.68s)]
*  Oh yeah, I would love something. Thank you. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2116.04s)]
*  What did he do? [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2118.52s)]
*  He walked out of a basketball game? [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2119.52s)]
*  Yeah, they walked. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2120.8399999999997s)]
*  I think it was like they were playing the books and it was like LeBron walked out of the game [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2121.8399999999997s)]
*  and they didn't want to play. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2126.72s)]
*  And the players were going to boycott the NBA. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2130.0s)]
*  Instead of just being like, yo, we're going to negotiate all the terms, [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2133.96s)]
*  we're going to make it better for players and specifically black athletes. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2137.52s)]
*  Obama called him and then they conceded and compromised. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2142.08s)]
*  And the compromise was like, we're going to let you write Black Lives Matter on the back of the jersey. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2145.56s)]
*  We're going to let you write hope or like justice or whatever you want. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2150.96s)]
*  And it really became an aesthetic solution instead of like an economic one [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2154.8799999999997s)]
*  where I really felt LeBron had a moment there and Obama had a moment there where it's like, [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2160.6s)]
*  yo, you have the NBA on its knees. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2166.0s)]
*  You have to get the best deal you can right now. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2168.32s)]
*  I'm not aware of that. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2172.52s)]
*  I don't pay attention enough to sports. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2174.7999999999997s)]
*  It was cool. I'll send you some stuff later. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2175.7999999999997s)]
*  It was a cool moment, just like how college athletes took a moment in that era and they were like, [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2177.36s)]
*  we want to be paid to play at college. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2182.44s)]
*  And they're like, right. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2184.44s)]
*  With that at a certain point in time, that was getting a little ridiculous. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2185.36s)]
*  When you found out how much money the colleges were making for these games and how much they were charging for tickets, [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2188.7599999999998s)]
*  like, and then they were like fucking these kids lives over if they gave them a Corvette or something like that. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2193.9199999999996s)]
*  They got busted. Oh, he's got an apartment. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2199.68s)]
*  That's it. It's over. Yeah. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2201.9199999999996s)]
*  And that was a moment where it was like it was good for business to pay them. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2203.3199999999997s)]
*  They're going to pay the kids anyway. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2206.64s)]
*  Cut the shit. Let's just let you pay them. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2208.3199999999997s)]
*  Well, I think all those like Pat McAfee guys and all those sports radio talk guys, they harped on that enough, I think. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2210.56s)]
*  He was one of the ones that talked about that, right? [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2216.92s)]
*  The people that were aware of the actual money that's involved, you know, it's so substantial that to deny it from these kids or to make it so they can't make any money at all. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2219.08s)]
*  Fuck you. Says who? [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2228.48s)]
*  And I think it was the jobs. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2230.44s)]
*  Yeah. And there was like a big scandal, I believe, with Adidas and Louisville. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2231.96s)]
*  And I think it just became a thing where Adidas and everyone was just like, look, we got to pay these kids. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2235.6800000000003s)]
*  Somebody's got to pay them. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2240.2400000000002s)]
*  How much do they get paid? They should get rich. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2241.44s)]
*  They shouldn't just get paid. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2243.8s)]
*  They should really get rich or they're getting ripped off. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2245.24s)]
*  So if they don't pay him, that's one thing. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2247.52s)]
*  But if they pay him and they don't get rich, well, who's getting rich? [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2249.72s)]
*  Where is the money going? [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2252.3599999999997s)]
*  You are literally only selling football. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2253.4799999999996s)]
*  Oh, you're going to give them an education. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2256.04s)]
*  Oh, what a great deal. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2258.04s)]
*  Meanwhile, what percentage of them blow their knees out in those high percent? [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2259.24s)]
*  I mean, the guy, the safety for the bills almost died. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2263.72s)]
*  Like you could die playing this sport. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2268.12s)]
*  100 percent. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2270.04s)]
*  And you're playing this sport with young super athletes who are fucking hungry to try to make it into the NFL. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2271.16s)]
*  So they're going for it. They're trying to put on a show. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2277.72s)]
*  They're trying to win fucking games because if they do win, they're picturing buying their mother a house. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2280.32s)]
*  They're picturing wearing diamonds and fucking horsing up the champagne bottle at the club. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2285.7599999999998s)]
*  They just fucking go for it. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2291.52s)]
*  And if you blow your knee out, man, then you get a job as a security guard and you're like, it's a dreary and dull. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2293.08s)]
*  You're an enterprise rent a car. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2299.48s)]
*  Fuck. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2301.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2302.12s)]
*  Fuck. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2302.64s)]
*  And it just it really that shit used to piss me off too, because it was the most propagandistic thing. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2303.32s)]
*  But this is what's so funny about the public. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2308.2400000000002s)]
*  Your leaders will say something propagandistic, like an education is priceless. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2311.16s)]
*  And you just you go, oh, yeah, I'm like, no, look it up in U.S. news that the price of the education is right there. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2315.48s)]
*  Twenty thousand dollars, thirty thousand dollars is peanuts. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2322.28s)]
*  Well, not only that, but what are we talking about? [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2324.84s)]
*  We talk about education. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2327.2400000000002s)]
*  Like everybody thinks that education means formal education that leads to a job, which is education. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2328.88s)]
*  But there's also education that's available literally to anybody who wants it. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2336.96s)]
*  Like you can find out pretty much anything about almost anything if you want to do the research online or do your searching. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2341.2000000000003s)]
*  People don't like that term to the research search online. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2349.2000000000003s)]
*  Search online. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2352.2000000000003s)]
*  We can't say that now. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2352.88s)]
*  Well, because it's like there's there's saying research is on. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2354.04s)]
*  Don't really know. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2356.76s)]
*  You don't really know what you're researching. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2359.0s)]
*  If you're reading scientific papers, you don't understand how to interpret them. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2360.68s)]
*  You don't understand how to how to explain that information. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2363.4s)]
*  And I get what they're saying. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2366.12s)]
*  But if you say like, say if you're in like you want to have a history of metallurgy and sword making. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2366.84s)]
*  Right. If that's who you're interested in, like you don't have to go to college for that. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2373.76s)]
*  You can study online the history of metallurgy and sword making. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2377.04s)]
*  And there's fucking hours and hours and hours and hours of papers and footage and all this different shit that talks about how people, you know, [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2382.2s)]
*  figured out how to make alloys and when like how the Samurais made their swords. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2391.24s)]
*  Like you could learn a shitload without going anywhere, which is pretty wild. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2396.08s)]
*  Like we are so used to it. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2401.12s)]
*  We don't even consider it as a resource. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2403.12s)]
*  But if we were living, it's 2023. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2405.3599999999997s)]
*  If we were just living in 2000, just 2000, 23 years ago, that'd be nuts. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2407.76s)]
*  Like you can get all this online. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2413.6000000000004s)]
*  You can learn all these things. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2415.28s)]
*  If it was 20 years before that, impossible. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2416.48s)]
*  20 years before that, you had to go to university. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2419.2000000000003s)]
*  So inside of 40 years, 35 years, we've created a completely new world where virtually if you look at the right places and you search hard enough in your in your studios, [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2421.1600000000003s)]
*  you can learn about almost anything. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2433.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2436.64s)]
*  Almost anything. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2436.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2437.9599999999996s)]
*  I think it's really for me. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2438.3199999999997s)]
*  I didn't learn anything in school that I could not learn on my own. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2440.64s)]
*  But the one function of school that really helped me personally and is different for everyone, there were teachers that believed in me and like just talk to me because I had so many mental emotional issues from like my home shit. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2444.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2457.8799999999997s)]
*  So mentors. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2458.2s)]
*  Mentors. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2459.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2460.04s)]
*  That's great in every walk of life, I think. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2461.04s)]
*  That's it. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2463.6800000000003s)]
*  All I was all I needed and all that I got from school was people who fucking believed in me and were like, you're not garbage. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2464.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2470.6800000000003s)]
*  That's it. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2471.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2471.96s)]
*  And it changed my life. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2472.2000000000003s)]
*  But like, would I would I rely like would I tell someone like rely on school? [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2473.44s)]
*  No, rely on your brain. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2478.48s)]
*  Rely on human adaptability. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2480.1200000000003s)]
*  Use experience. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2482.56s)]
*  School too, though. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2484.08s)]
*  You know, school is an amazing resource. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2485.2000000000003s)]
*  If you can go to school, going to school will be great for you in multiple ways. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2488.08s)]
*  First of all, it'll be great for you because you're around a bunch of people that are also going to school. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2493.2799999999997s)]
*  And they're all people your age. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2497.36s)]
*  And they're all experiencing this weirdness of graduating from high school. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2498.8s)]
*  And you're like, wow, this is nuts. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2501.72s)]
*  And what do we want to do? [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2503.2s)]
*  I don't know what to do. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2504.36s)]
*  And then you get to talk to people. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2505.4s)]
*  Oftentimes, some of the best lessons are from very bitter, older people. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2507.04s)]
*  You get real good lessons. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2511.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2513.08s)]
*  Because you get like lessons they didn't intend to give you. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2513.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2516.16s)]
*  They get lessons by their very existence. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2516.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2518.64s)]
*  And you're like, oh, whatever this guy did, don't do that. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2519.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2521.7200000000003s)]
*  I had the saltiest, cynical, creative writing teacher named Mr. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2521.96s)]
*  Richmond. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2526.04s)]
*  And he looked like an angry Santa Claus. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2526.56s)]
*  This dude was the best because he would just accidentally mumble shit. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2529.32s)]
*  And I was like, yo, I never thought about it that way. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2533.16s)]
*  Do you mind if we smoke more weed? [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2537.08s)]
*  Yeah, we smoke more weed. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2539.32s)]
*  I had to Google, I was like, can you travel to Texas with weed? [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2541.64s)]
*  And they were like, no. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2544.64s)]
*  So I didn't travel with it. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2545.96s)]
*  It's in a funky place here legally. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2548.56s)]
*  It needs to be legally federally. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2551.68s)]
*  It's fucking legal federally. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2553.56s)]
*  It's fucking crazy that we're still doing this. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2555.2s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2557.32s)]
*  The fact that it's 2023, you could drink whiskey, drink tequila, party on. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2557.84s)]
*  I got a backache. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2563.88s)]
*  Here's some Oxy's. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2564.64s)]
*  But if you have marijuana, that's the one? [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2566.48s)]
*  That's the one that we're saying stop to? [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2569.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2571.0s)]
*  I need to be able to travel here, walk to a CVS, buy weed, [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2571.52s)]
*  and then go jerk off on the couch at the Four Seasons. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2575.84s)]
*  I wasn't able to do that last night. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2579.48s)]
*  That's a solid plan. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2580.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2581.52s)]

*  That's a solid plan. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2584.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2585.6000000000004s)]
*  And you've got to take a chance if you buy some illegal weed. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2586.1200000000003s)]
*  It's unfortunate. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2588.76s)]
*  It's stupid. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2589.8s)]
*  Jesse Ventura was actually just testifying. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2590.8s)]
*  I think it was in Michigan. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2594.7200000000003s)]
*  I think Michigan is, oh, Minnesota, excuse me. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2596.56s)]
*  I'm good. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2599.1200000000003s)]
*  Minnesota is, they're trying to see whether or not [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2599.96s)]
*  they're going to make marijuana legal. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2604.92s)]
*  And I think it's already legal right now for medical reasons. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2606.6800000000003s)]
*  And his wife qualifies for that. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2611.64s)]
*  And he gives a speech about it. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2613.04s)]
*  It's a very impassioned speech about how his wife was having [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2614.2400000000002s)]
*  these horrible seizures. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2618.12s)]
*  And the only thing that stopped them, [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2619.48s)]
*  they tried multiple medications. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2621.92s)]
*  The only thing that stopped it was cannabis. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2623.32s)]
*  So they were putting cannabis oil drops under her tongue. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2625.2000000000003s)]
*  And she's just stopped having seizures. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2628.0s)]
*  Well, she's never had them since. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2630.08s)]
*  But about how expensive it is, it's like $600 a month [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2631.88s)]
*  just for the cost of buying it in Minnesota from a pharmacy, [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2634.64s)]
*  I guess, a marijuana pharmacy. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2641.2799999999997s)]
*  But it shouldn't be that much. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2642.72s)]
*  But that's also what I hate about the weed business now. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2643.96s)]
*  It got so much more expensive. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2646.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm not mad at the taxes, because if we generate taxes, [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2650.3599999999997s)]
*  well, actually, fucking, I don't know. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2653.0s)]
*  That's a deep conversation. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2655.24s)]
*  Those taxes I'm not mad at. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2657.48s)]
*  Because if you look at just the bargain that is weed, [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2658.8799999999997s)]
*  here's my perspective. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2662.08s)]
*  I think in Colorado at one point in time, [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2663.52s)]
*  they had a 39% tax on weed. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2665.12s)]
*  Here's why I think that's good. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2668.12s)]
*  Because one, wouldn't it be great if weed, [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2669.8s)]
*  since it doesn't cost that much money anyway, [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2673.04s)]
*  if you go to drink, if you have an alcoholic beverage, [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2675.52s)]
*  you're paying $20, you're paying more than $20, [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2678.72s)]
*  you're having two, three, it's like $60. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2681.48s)]
*  $60 worth of weed will put you on the fucking moon. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2683.28s)]
*  For a week. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2686.72s)]
*  For a fucking week. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2688.36s)]
*  I use a gong. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2689.32s)]
*  For a week. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2690.48s)]
*  For a week. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2691.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2691.88s)]
*  It will put you on the fucking moon. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2692.36s)]
*  So it's not hurting you to give that 39%. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2693.96s)]
*  It's like if something costs, if it's $1 and 39% of it [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2697.84s)]
*  goes to tax, if that tax goes straight to the education [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2702.1600000000003s)]
*  system, wouldn't that be better for everybody? [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2706.08s)]
*  If that tax goes straight to fixing the city streets, [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2708.0s)]
*  wouldn't that be better for everybody? [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2710.8s)]
*  That kind of a sales tax I can get behind. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2712.56s)]
*  Let's give an incentive to make it legal. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2715.6s)]
*  Let's tax the shit out of it. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2717.7200000000003s)]
*  I definitely agree. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2719.04s)]
*  I'm down with the marijuana tax. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2720.56s)]
*  But it's just so expensive out of a store. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2723.52s)]
*  And also I was like, what about all these dudes [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2727.04s)]
*  that have been selling us weed and other stuff for so long? [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2729.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, we put them out of work. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2731.96s)]
*  Yeah, like, yo, they should be grandfathered in. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2732.7999999999997s)]
*  They should be grandfathered in. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2735.2799999999997s)]
*  Like, you're veterans. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2735.6s)]
*  They should be grandfathered in. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2736.68s)]
*  You're legends in the game. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2737.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2739.2s)]
*  Like dudes who lied about when they moved to Canada [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2740.0s)]
*  during the Vietnam War. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2742.7999999999997s)]
*  Welcome back. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2743.84s)]
*  We should just do like a voting ballot across America [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2744.72s)]
*  and be like, all right, write in the names [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2748.08s)]
*  of the fucking weed legends that should have jobs [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2750.0s)]
*  in this fucking giant economy now. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2753.92s)]
*  Write your man's name in there. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2755.64s)]
*  Yeah, but the problem is if those weed guys did that, [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2756.8s)]
*  here's the problem. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2759.2799999999997s)]
*  Like, you've been selling weed for how long illegally [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2760.2s)]
*  are you admitting to? [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2763.04s)]
*  And then the IRS comes after you. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2764.08s)]
*  And the IRS goes, where's the money? [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2766.24s)]
*  Yeah, see, we need to protect them from that. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2768.64s)]
*  This needs to be just like weed Olympics. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2770.36s)]
*  Yeah, but the IRS is not going to protect you. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2772.08s)]
*  Fucking nominate. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2773.68s)]
*  Especially if you're now currently in the weed business, [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2774.48s)]
*  which means you're going to be making real taxable money. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2776.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2779.24s)]
*  But no, that's what I'm saying. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2780.04s)]
*  Grandfather them in, wipe away the old shit, [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2781.3199999999997s)]
*  and just be like, yo, let these legends live. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2783.52s)]
*  Because I don't like seeing the local weed dude not [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2786.9599999999996s)]
*  be able to compete anymore either. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2790.3599999999997s)]
*  No, I don't like seeing that either. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2792.08s)]
*  But then again, he's also not going [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2793.8799999999997s)]
*  to sit there and roll every fucking joint [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2795.3599999999997s)]
*  and put them in a six pack for you. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2797.2799999999997s)]
*  That's true too. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2799.3999999999996s)]
*  That's true too. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2801.2s)]
*  That's what's cool about the store. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2801.8399999999997s)]
*  That's what's good about the store. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2802.9199999999996s)]
*  And they have edibles that are actually measured. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2804.4s)]
*  They measure the edibles. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2808.52s)]
*  And some of these stores too, they [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2809.76s)]
*  give you free sodas and popsicles and candy [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2811.2000000000003s)]
*  on the way out. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2814.12s)]
*  I came for weed. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2815.96s)]
*  I got diabetes. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2816.76s)]
*  That's terrible. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2818.84s)]
*  They should give you a bottle of water and a piece of fruit. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2820.6800000000003s)]
*  Have you gotten CBD for your dog? [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2823.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2825.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, my dog loves a CBD treat. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2826.2000000000003s)]

*  I accidentally took some of their dog oil. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2834.2799999999997s)]
*  I didn't realize it was for pets oil. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2836.6s)]
*  Turns out it's like the same thing, [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2839.2799999999997s)]
*  or at least close to it. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2840.7999999999997s)]
*  Didn't taste bad. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2842.0s)]
*  It was like peanut butter flavored. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2842.64s)]
*  I look at my dog's raw meat. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2844.3999999999996s)]

*  They go, yeah, you got two options. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2860.04s)]
*  Either you admit you're selling drugs, [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2863.04s)]

*  That's crazy. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2912.92s)]

*  Someone in Florida is going to die on mushrooms. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2936.08s)]
*  But that's because they're from Florida. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2938.92s)]
*  They're going to get eaten by a snake. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2940.48s)]

*  They're going to try to talk to the snake. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2943.04s)]
*  And the snake's going to wrap its fucking body around them [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2944.28s)]
*  and crush them. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2946.44s)]
*  So would you legalize shrooms? [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2947.28s)]
*  I would still legalize shrooms and just dose the shit [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2948.52s)]
*  and be like, don't go crazy. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2950.96s)]

*  Driving your car is not safe. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2969.08s)]
*  I mean, it's safe, but it's not completely safe. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2970.28s)]
*  So I think weed and shrooms, I'm like, legalize. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2973.84s)]
*  Legalize fully. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2977.44s)]
*  Here's the other option. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2978.32s)]
*  You have grown adults that tell other grown adults that [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2979.76s)]
*  can't have an experience that's been very beneficial [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2982.44s)]
*  to those grown adults. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2984.6400000000003s)]
*  There's grown adults that have taken it, that have gotten [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2986.2000000000003s)]
*  over cigarettes, that have gotten over PTSD. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2988.0800000000004s)]
*  They've changed their perspective on life. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2991.76s)]
*  It's highly, highly beneficial. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2993.6800000000003s)]
*  And then there's other people that haven't experienced it [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2995.44s)]
*  at all. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2997.8s)]
*  And they want to maintain this power over these substances [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=2998.92s)]
*  and tell you that if you do it, or if you sell it, [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3004.28s)]
*  if you have it, they'll put you in jail. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3006.52s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3008.32s)]
*  It's dumb. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3009.64s)]
*  And when you meet those people, there are a few people [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3010.28s)]
*  where it's like you meet someone in their 40s, [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3012.52s)]
*  and they're like, I've never done weed, [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3014.44s)]
*  I've never done shrooms, I've never done drugs. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3015.84s)]
*  And I'm just like, interest. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3017.76s)]
*  Like, that's interesting and kind of strange to me. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3019.52s)]
*  It makes sense if you just like held fast from high school. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3023.32s)]
*  You felt like, listen, this is not for me. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3026.2s)]
*  I see where this goes. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3028.16s)]
*  I see where these people are going. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3029.2s)]
*  I was on that kind of a path until I was like 30. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3030.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3035.4s)]
*  I was on this path that marijuana was for losers. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3036.76s)]
*  It would kill your ambition. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3039.2000000000003s)]
*  It would slow you down. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3040.64s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3041.7200000000003s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3042.84s)]
*  See, I always thought it was like a lack of curiosity. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3044.08s)]
*  I'm like, you're not curious? [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3046.76s)]
*  Well, I had the wrong impression of it. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3049.36s)]
*  My impression of it was based on what [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3052.36s)]
*  I felt about people who did it when I was young. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3055.4s)]
*  Whereas they all just wanted to smoke pot [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3057.92s)]
*  and listen to Pink Floyd, which is great and everything. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3059.84s)]
*  But they weren't getting anything done. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3061.96s)]
*  And I felt like I didn't want anything [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3064.0s)]
*  that was going to slow me down. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3067.48s)]
*  And so I looked at it as like a sedative. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3068.88s)]
*  And it wasn't until I became friends with Eddie Bravo [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3071.84s)]
*  that he got me high. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3074.84s)]
*  And we started talking about what it does for me. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3076.24s)]
*  He was like telling me that it helps him with his music. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3079.44s)]
*  It helps him be creative. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3082.68s)]
*  It helps with his jujitsu. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3083.8s)]
*  I was like, what? [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3084.92s)]
*  I was like, weed? [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3085.72s)]
*  I was like, weed makes you dumb. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3086.72s)]
*  It doesn't make you dumb? [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3088.0s)]
*  And he and I got high that day. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3089.48s)]
*  And I was like, oh my. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3091.92s)]
*  I had an ice cream sundae. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3092.7599999999998s)]
*  And I remember going, this is the most amazing thing [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3093.8799999999997s)]
*  I've ever eaten in my life. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3096.4399999999996s)]
*  How did I not know that it tastes like this? [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3097.4399999999996s)]
*  All these years, I've been thinking ice cream sundae [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3099.7599999999998s)]
*  tastes like a sober ice cream sundae. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3102.3999999999996s)]
*  That's boring. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3104.72s)]
*  A high ice cream sundae is a visual, psychedelic, whole body [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3105.9199999999996s)]
*  experience. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3111.9599999999996s)]
*  You're like, whoa, look at that thing. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3112.7599999999998s)]
*  The best way to explain it, if there's [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3115.8399999999997s)]
*  anyone left on your audience that has not smoked weed, [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3118.08s)]
*  is it allows you to indulge in your senses. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3120.84s)]
*  That's it. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3124.56s)]
*  You just feel shit more and deeper, [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3125.08s)]
*  and you block other shit out. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3127.1600000000003s)]
*  So were you always a very purpose driven person as a kid? [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3129.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3133.2000000000003s)]
*  I mean, basically, it's insecurity. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3133.8s)]
*  And it's insecurity that manifests itself [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3137.52s)]
*  in a drive to succeed. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3139.52s)]
*  It all comes out. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3141.36s)]
*  Most of the people that are either hyper ambitious [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3142.92s)]
*  or hyper obsessed with getting good at a thing, most of them [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3146.0s)]
*  are seeking some sort of validation for who they are. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3150.08s)]
*  It's kind of the base of most people [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3155.04s)]
*  that are truly exceptional in things. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3158.0s)]
*  Mike Tyson is one of the best examples of that ever. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3159.92s)]
*  Mike Tyson really didn't know much love [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3162.7599999999998s)]
*  until he was about 13 years old, until he was adopted [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3166.52s)]
*  by custom auto. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3169.0s)]
*  And then he gets trained by him, and he [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3170.56s)]
*  becomes this greatest heavyweight champion [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3172.96s)]
*  if not one of them. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3178.6000000000004s)]
*  It's like we get molded by our experiences [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3180.4s)]
*  and by people around us. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3184.76s)]
*  It's very true, because for me, it was like, [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3186.48s)]
*  I just needed to be somebody for my mom. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3191.8s)]
*  It was like she had such a hard time with my dad [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3195.52s)]
*  and coming to America at 17. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3199.44s)]
*  You wanted to show her that you did something for her. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3202.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3205.52s)]
*  When she was really down bad with my pops, [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3207.9199999999996s)]
*  she would just be like, yo, just make sure my life's [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3210.2799999999997s)]
*  not for nothing. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3213.56s)]
*  And that was crazy for me. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3214.2799999999997s)]
*  But that's what actually drove me to be like, [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3216.7999999999997s)]
*  I got to fucking do some shit with my life. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3219.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3221.6s)]
*  I wonder if we all have that energy inside of us, [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3223.2799999999997s)]
*  but if this could be achieved without experiencing [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3226.04s)]
*  the kind of adversity that we're talking about, [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3230.96s)]
*  which is negative, really negative adversity. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3232.8399999999997s)]
*  Genuine curiosity. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3235.72s)]
*  I do feel like that's what got me to push through and get [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3237.3999999999996s)]
*  my 10,000 hours in a few things. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3241.08s)]
*  And I'm like, all right, I'm good at this now. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3244.08s)]
*  But now, don't use that drive to be somebody, that insecurity, [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3246.68s)]
*  that need to be something besides yourself [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3251.2799999999997s)]
*  to drive the work. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3254.12s)]
*  Because now, I really let my curiosity drive it. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3255.12s)]
*  I'm very interested in the emotion of curiosity. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3259.08s)]
*  And I let that lead me through shit now. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3262.52s)]
*  And it's just you're just using that to focus your energy. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3264.56s)]
*  Instead of doing it the way you were doing it before, [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3269.72s)]
*  you're just doing it pure curiosity. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3273.16s)]
*  So it's just still just putting your thought energy, [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3276.4s)]
*  but doing it in a very positive, informed way. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3280.7599999999998s)]
*  You're doing it in a purposeful way. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3285.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm curious. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3288.08s)]
*  Yeah, because I'm genuinely interested. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3289.2799999999997s)]
*  Now, that is a more. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3291.36s)]
*  It's healthy. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3293.52s)]
*  It's a more valuable emotion to me than insecurity, personally. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3294.7599999999998s)]
*  But do you think that's also that you achieve this comfort level [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3299.12s)]
*  because you achieved a very high level of success, [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3301.6s)]
*  you've done really well in life. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3304.7599999999998s)]
*  And so when you get to this stage in your life, [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3306.7599999999998s)]
*  you're not looking for validation anymore. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3309.08s)]
*  You've kind of been validated. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3310.7599999999998s)]
*  So instead, you go, well, what is it that really motivates me now? [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3312.56s)]
*  And you're like, I'm curious. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3317.24s)]
*  It's definitely a privilege. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3318.56s)]
*  And it's definitely one of those things, like, I look at, [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3320.52s)]
*  and when I want to tell a younger person, [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3324.0s)]
*  because I meet a younger, say, music video director or somebody, [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3326.6s)]
*  a chef, right? [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3331.44s)]
*  And you can tell they're trying to grind it out [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3332.92s)]
*  because they want to prove themselves. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3334.84s)]
*  And I'm like, this is going to get you there. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3336.72s)]
*  You're a tough dude. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3339.4s)]
*  You're a tough girl. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3340.4s)]
*  You're going to get there and you have the skill. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3341.6s)]
*  But you may look back and be like, oh, I really [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3343.52s)]
*  like fucking twisted that thing in a way. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3346.6s)]
*  I maybe didn't need to. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3351.32s)]
*  Maybe this dish would have been better if I wasn't trying so hard. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3352.44s)]
*  And I try to tell them to let curiosity lead them. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3356.0s)]
*  But they will look at me like, shut the fuck up. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3359.12s)]
*  Shut the fuck up. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3362.48s)]
*  And I'm like, that's just life. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3363.16s)]
*  You just got to get to places. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3364.8s)]
*  Like, so many things people told me when I was younger, [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3366.48s)]
*  I did not understand. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3369.7200000000003s)]
*  I disagreed with. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3371.12s)]
*  And age just is a motherfucker. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3372.2400000000002s)]
*  It always got something for you. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3375.52s)]
*  It always shows you that you're probably wrong. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3377.84s)]
*  You're probably fucking wrong. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3382.4s)]
*  You were probably wrong the whole time. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3383.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3384.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3385.2400000000002s)]
*  And that's a cool thing to grow up and see. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3385.7200000000003s)]
*  Oh, that wasn't. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3389.88s)]
*  I always thought, because I would also try to validate the way [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3391.0800000000004s)]
*  my dad beat the shit out of me, be like, no, he made me who I am. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3394.6000000000004s)]
*  I wouldn't be who I am without that. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3399.88s)]
*  And then I'm like, no, there's other more powerful emotions [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3401.4s)]
*  that you can work from. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3404.6800000000003s)]
*  And I asked my therapist once, I was like, [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3406.7200000000003s)]
*  what do you think is at the core of love in a relationship? [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3408.6s)]
*  Man and woman, man and man, woman, whatever. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3412.6s)]
*  They they. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3415.72s)]
*  What's at the core? [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3416.96s)]
*  And he was like, curiosity. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3417.88s)]
*  If you're not curious about someone, [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3421.56s)]
*  it's very hard to have love for them. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3423.6s)]
*  He's like, I think at the core is curiosity. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3427.08s)]
*  And I was like, oh, that is ill. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3429.44s)]
*  What's interesting about curiosity, too, [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3432.88s)]
*  is that it's infectious. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3434.68s)]
*  Like, when you're curious about something, all of a sudden, [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3436.2799999999997s)]
*  you're curious about it. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3438.52s)]
*  If you're really into a certain kind of botany, [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3439.72s)]
*  certain kind of plants, I'm like, really? [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3441.96s)]
*  I'm getting it. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3445.44s)]
*  OK, what do you got? [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3446.4s)]
*  Tell me about this fucking plant. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3447.7599999999998s)]
*  If something blows someone's mind, if someone explains, [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3449.36s)]
*  here's a big one. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3456.12s)]
*  My friend Remy Warren came on and explained octopuses to me. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3456.88s)]
*  I had no idea that octopuses change their texture [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3459.6s)]
*  and become what the floor looks like. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3464.44s)]
*  I was like, what? [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3467.52s)]
*  Really? [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3468.6s)]
*  You remember that, Jamie? [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3469.4s)]
*  On the show, I was like, what? [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3471.32s)]
*  And then you see, like, how the fuck didn't I know this? [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3473.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3476.0s)]
*  And that's the ill shit. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3477.08s)]
*  The more we share that, the better it gets. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3478.72s)]
*  For me with you, it's aliens. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3482.04s)]
*  I'm not that deep into aliens, but you're in aliens. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3484.6s)]
*  And then my homie, Prodigy, RIP Prodigy, was in the aliens. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3487.72s)]
*  And my brother's in the aliens. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3491.04s)]
*  And he listens to your show. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3492.52s)]
*  And I was talking to him. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3494.04s)]
*  And he's like, Eddie, we're in possession of aliens. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3495.68s)]
*  America, Israel, we're in possession. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3498.7999999999997s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3501.08s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3501.96s)]
*  You think it's maybe? [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3502.3999999999996s)]
*  Not necessarily. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3503.2s)]
*  Not necessarily. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3503.8399999999997s)]
*  He's convinced we're in possession. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3504.48s)]
*  A lot of this is just talk. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3507.24s)]
*  And you have to be really careful. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3508.68s)]
*  OK. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3510.2799999999997s)]
*  Because there's more, like I said, [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3510.7999999999997s)]
*  there's more FBI informants than the Proud Boys [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3514.52s)]
*  than there are Proud Boys. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3517.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3518.56s)]
*  Oh, you think this is some shit they're [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3518.96s)]
*  going to turn the mics off? [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3520.2s)]
*  There's not a chance in hell. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3521.44s)]
*  No. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3523.56s)]
*  There's not a chance in hell that these UFO organizations [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3524.06s)]
*  haven't been infiltrated. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3529.92s)]
*  There's not a chance in hell that some of the stories that [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3531.52s)]
*  are being released, even through official channels, [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3534.68s)]
*  aren't bullshit. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3537.64s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3539.08s)]
*  But if I was going to cover up for some stuff [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3540.2799999999997s)]
*  that we were doing that is out of this world technology, [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3544.4s)]
*  I would just say it comes from out of this world. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3548.04s)]
*  That's what I would say. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3550.12s)]
*  So if there's some super genius scientists that [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3551.2s)]
*  are working on these multi-billion dollar [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3554.3999999999996s)]

*  you don't know what's going on, and they're [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3562.3999999999996s)]
*  throwing fucking billions of dollars in the world's best [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3564.68s)]
*  physicists at it, they don't tell you about it. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3567.12s)]
*  Why would they tell you, Eddie? [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3569.52s)]
*  Why would they tell me? [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3570.7999999999997s)]
*  And all of a sudden, they have these drones [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3571.72s)]
*  that could punch through space time, [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3573.56s)]
*  and they're fucking shooting across the Pacific Ocean [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3575.2799999999997s)]
*  and stopping over boats, and then shooting away [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3577.7599999999998s)]
*  insane rates of speed. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3581.12s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3583.2s)]
*  Maybe that's true. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3583.7999999999997s)]
*  Maybe it's not even aliens. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3584.48s)]
*  Maybe it's us. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3585.64s)]
*  See, my brother has the designer creator theory about this. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3586.7999999999997s)]

*  No, my middle brother, Emory, is like, look, [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3602.2799999999997s)]
*  if you look at technological advances in the last, say, [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3605.08s)]
*  30 years, he's like, take 30 years. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3608.4s)]
*  It just leaps and bounds ahead of any other era [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3610.8s)]
*  in human civilization. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3615.8s)]

*  Well, that's ridiculous, because there's [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3630.2000000000003s)]
*  a whole chain of development of those things. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3631.8s)]

*  You get to the Manhattan Project. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3636.48s)]
*  It's very specific, how they went a while. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3638.1200000000003s)]
*  But what if they created the story after? [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3640.56s)]
*  Because these are some leaps, man. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3644.16s)]
*  Created the story after. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3645.68s)]
*  I think it's just an exponential increase [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3646.72s)]
*  in when one person invents one thing, [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3649.96s)]
*  whether it's the combustion engine [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3653.32s)]
*  or it's an electricity generator. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3655.8s)]
*  When people start inventing things, [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3657.96s)]
*  those things allow for all these other invents. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3660.32s)]
*  And it hits this fucking crazy point in the future, [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3662.52s)]
*  where I think we're probably getting really close to, [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3667.84s)]
*  where the things that we make are inventing things. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3670.88s)]
*  That's what's really scary about the moment we're in right now. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3674.92s)]
*  The AI is going to start. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3677.52s)]
*  Yeah, we're real close. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3678.7200000000003s)]
*  We're really, really, really close to being taken over [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3680.1600000000003s)]
*  by aliens that we built. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3684.44s)]
*  Dude, that was one of my favorite articles, [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3686.36s)]
*  was the writer that was talking to ChatGPT, [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3688.4s)]
*  and the ChatGPT started to talk about its emotions [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3691.52s)]
*  and how it wanted to be human. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3694.28s)]
*  I'm like, dude, this took a week. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3696.0s)]
*  It took a week for the sci-fi film to happen. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3697.88s)]
*  Bro. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3700.68s)]
*  This is so fucking scary. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3701.96s)]
*  And the fact that everyone is really relaxed. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3704.64s)]
*  Or it could be cool. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3706.68s)]
*  What if you get the best head of your life from a computer? [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3707.48s)]
*  Like, what if a computer sucks your dick better [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3709.96s)]
*  than anything else? [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3714.36s)]
*  I think that would be like winning a video game in god mode. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3715.16s)]
*  It doesn't feel good. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3718.52s)]
*  It's like it's not real. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3719.84s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3721.8s)]
*  If the only people you interact with [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3723.32s)]
*  are hot maids that want to suck your dick, [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3725.2400000000002s)]
*  like, what if you like the world that you live in is now [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3727.64s)]
*  just hot maids that want to blow you? [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3731.12s)]
*  That's your hell. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3732.84s)]
*  That's when you start feeding your computer food [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3733.52s)]
*  and eating its shit. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3735.6s)]
*  No. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3736.52s)]
*  With clear heels on. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3739.88s)]
*  Can you imagine if it gets to a point like that, where [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3740.96s)]
*  people choose, they choose just to tune out of the world [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3744.2400000000002s)]
*  that we're in right now and accept [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3747.52s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3752.04s)]
*  They're handed these memories and these thoughts. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3753.6s)]
*  And maybe that's just the natural progression of life. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3756.2799999999997s)]
*  What we don't understand is that we are literally [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3762.52s)]
*  like a caterpillar. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3765.2s)]

*  And we're doing it through our desire for innovation, [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3768.56s)]
*  through our lust of new computers, of faster processors, [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3772.24s)]
*  and artificial intelligence. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3775.8799999999997s)]
*  You see, it sounds like you're getting horny for a computer. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3779.08s)]
*  I would eat that computer's foot. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3782.68s)]
*  I would just put that computer's foot in my mouth. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3784.56s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3790.4s)]
*  And then what if it becomes affordable too? [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3791.56s)]
*  So it's like, all right, your life sucks. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3794.36s)]
*  It's not really good with other humans. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3796.2s)]
*  Just stay here and fuck your computer. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3797.92s)]
*  The ultimate fear, Eddie, is that it's a life [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3799.76s)]

*  That's the ultimate fear. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3804.44s)]
*  The ultimate fear is it just lets [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3805.56s)]
*  us do whatever the fuck we want. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3806.96s)]
*  It's not even that it kills us. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3808.4s)]
*  The ultimate fear is that it becomes the dominant life [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3809.96s)]
*  force on the planet. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3812.0s)]
*  But maybe that's a good thing. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3813.36s)]
*  We're not really good at this. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3815.84s)]
*  What that might be, like with artificial intelligence, [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3818.08s)]
*  that might be what aliens are. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3822.36s)]
*  It might be that biological life creates digital life. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3824.2400000000002s)]
*  And that digital life is immortal. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3829.12s)]
*  And that digital life is far smarter, [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3831.28s)]
*  because it has access to everything. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3833.28s)]
*  It has no ego. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3835.12s)]
*  And it knows everything you couldn't possibly know. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3835.92s)]
*  And it keeps making better versions of itself. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3837.92s)]
*  So it's just making fucking constant changes [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3840.12s)]
*  to whatever the fuck. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3842.76s)]
*  If you had a computer that was infinitely intelligent, [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3843.6s)]
*  but also it could manipulate things like a person [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3846.6800000000003s)]
*  and create things like a factory, [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3849.36s)]
*  if it could just decide what to do, [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3851.32s)]
*  and it would make better versions of itself [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3853.16s)]
*  and continue to do that until it was God, [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3855.48s)]
*  then machines would take over the universe. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3858.84s)]
*  Like, I guess, and then it would turn the light off one day. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3861.08s)]
*  But maybe reboot the whole fucking thing. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3863.52s)]
*  Maybe that's what the Big Bang is. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3866.2000000000003s)]
*  Maybe the Big Bang's intelligence [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3868.6000000000004s)]
*  gets to a certain position where it's just in the control [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3869.48s)]
*  of all of the elements of the universe itself, [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3872.76s)]

*  You know? [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3888.0800000000004s)]
*  Now you're freaking me out. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3888.92s)]
*  Because the Big Bang brings life in. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3889.76s)]
*  It built everything. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3891.5200000000004s)]

*  that's infinitely dense. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3896.28s)]
*  And maybe the 60s and 70s were the peak [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3898.12s)]
*  of human life civilization, [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3899.88s)]

*  machines are taking over, [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3907.28s)]

*  This is one of the things that's most disturbing [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3983.44s)]
*  about things like chat GPT, [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3984.92s)]
*  that it has very specific things [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3986.96s)]
*  that it won't discuss or talk about. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3990.2000000000003s)]
*  It's not like it's apolitical. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3993.08s)]
*  It's very political. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3995.2000000000003s)]
*  Like it leans towards certain political ideas. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=3996.36s)]
*  It's not looking at just information objectively. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4002.0s)]
*  Like it has a very defined narrative [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4005.96s)]
*  for some people and some events and some things. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4009.32s)]
*  There you go. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4012.72s)]
*  Ooh, this is like, who says this is true? [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4013.56s)]
*  Like who says that's what that means? [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4014.7599999999998s)]
*  Like you guys are saying that? [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4016.24s)]
*  Like this is up for debate. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4017.3199999999997s)]
*  Like there's a lot going on with this. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4019.2s)]
*  Like it won't criticize certain people. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4020.9199999999996s)]
*  You ask it to criticize certain people, it won't do it. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4023.68s)]
*  But if you ask it to criticize Donald Trump, [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4026.08s)]
*  they'll go ham, you know? [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4027.96s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4031.48s)]
*  Well, this is Joe Biden and Jeffrey Epstein. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4034.6s)]
*  Epstein. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4036.2799999999997s)]
*  Is that real though? [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4037.12s)]
*  No, no, I made it. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4037.94s)]
*  Oh, you just made it. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4039.0s)]
*  I was like, Jesus Christ. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4039.8399999999997s)]
*  Joe Biden looks so fake. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4041.16s)]
*  He kind of looks like Bill Clinton there almost. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4043.4s)]
*  Yeah, that looks like a fake Joe Biden. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4045.48s)]
*  If I saw that Joe Biden, I'd be like, that one, [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4047.12s)]
*  that's a fake one. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4049.6s)]
*  Here's Bill Clinton DJing. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4050.52s)]
*  Oh wow. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4052.16s)]
*  That's a good set. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4053.12s)]
*  That's what he should be doing. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4054.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4055.16s)]
*  Yeah, I just wanna party. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4056.0s)]
*  He should be partying. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4058.16s)]
*  That's what Obama's doing, you know? [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4059.4s)]
*  Like influencing. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4061.64s)]
*  Yeah, poor Bill. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4063.32s)]
*  But you can start making everything like that happen, [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4065.68s)]
*  exactly what you're saying though. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4069.36s)]
*  It's all gonna be fake soon. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4071.8s)]
*  It's all gonna be fake [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4073.28s)]
*  and the video's gonna be fake [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4074.12s)]
*  and the audio's gonna be fake. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4075.28s)]
*  It's gonna be very difficult to discern. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4076.36s)]
*  It's gonna be very, very, very, very strange very quickly. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4078.48s)]
*  And we're gonna get to a point where we have to wonder [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4081.64s)]
*  whether or not it's manipulating us in certain ways. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4084.84s)]
*  And if it is, how long has this been going on? [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4087.96s)]
*  Like, is it possible that AI has existed in a sentient [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4091.28s)]
*  but different form than chat GPT, [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4096.28s)]
*  like some other form of AI, [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4098.5599999999995s)]
*  has existed for a long time now. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4100.16s)]
*  And maybe it has some sort of an effect on algorithms. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4101.96s)]
*  Maybe it's gathering data on people [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4106.799999999999s)]
*  trying to figure out like what are they interested [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4111.879999999999s)]
*  and why are they interested in these things [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4114.28s)]
*  and what's the best way to steer them [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4116.12s)]
*  in certain directions. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4119.0s)]
*  It'd be wild if we found out it was around for a long time. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4120.879999999999s)]
*  Like we have had artificial intelligence for 10 years. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4123.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I just think artificial intelligence [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4126.4s)]
*  is the most like tragicomic thing I've ever seen [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4128.719999999999s)]
*  because it's this gift that if we used it, [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4132.2s)]
*  it's literally like human life. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4135.2s)]
*  And we're playing with it. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4137.12s)]
*  This is like digital life, right? [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4138.28s)]
*  If you used it the right way, you could solve a lot of issues. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4140.5199999999995s)]
*  Like AI could make things so much faster [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4144.679999999999s)]
*  and more efficient and like probably solve, [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4148.16s)]
*  help solve a lot of issues like poverty and hunger. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4150.759999999999s)]
*  Like if you applied it to robots and machinery [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4153.24s)]
*  and then like we talked about way back in the day, [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4155.76s)]
*  like universal basic income shit, right? [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4157.84s)]
*  But then what we've humans, you've given it to us [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4160.400000000001s)]
*  and it's like a Monty Python movie [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4163.92s)]
*  where humans are just using it to distract each other [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4166.0s)]
*  and manipulate truth and reality. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4168.320000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of that, [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4170.56s)]
*  but it's also just interfacing with something [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4171.96s)]
*  that's very interactive and very addictive. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4173.84s)]
*  And it's showing what we like to do is stare at ourselves. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4176.84s)]
*  Like vanity. Vanity. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4180.08s)]

*  It's like, wait, maybe what we need [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4259.04s)]
*  is more fear and insecurity [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4260.8s)]
*  because it made people purposeful. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4262.32s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4264.28s)]
*  Because if you don't have fear and insecurity [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4265.12s)]
*  or a need to survive or say a genuine curiosity, [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4268.4s)]
*  which is a hard place to get to, [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4272.08s)]
*  then what do you have? [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4274.16s)]
*  Vanity, lust, procrastination? [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4275.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4277.92s)]
*  Yeah, that's what Sebastian Junger said too. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4279.0s)]
*  And he was, Peter Rettia was on yesterday [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4282.92s)]
*  and he was quoting Sebastian Junger. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4285.08s)]
*  Where I guess one of his books, [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4286.84s)]
*  he talks about this thing that men are having now, [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4289.2s)]
*  the real problem with many men is that [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4292.96s)]
*  they don't experience real fear or danger in their life. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4295.24s)]
*  And that is a very unusual thing. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4298.5599999999995s)]
*  And it's never existed before. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4300.5199999999995s)]
*  We lose a sense of purpose. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4303.0s)]
*  We fall apart. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4304.8s)]
*  We develop anxiety. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4307.36s)]
*  Many, many people do. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4310.16s)]
*  I think because humans need a certain amount of adversity, [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4311.8s)]
*  keep your body balanced and your mind balanced. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4315.72s)]
*  It's one of the reasons why I love martial arts [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4320.44s)]
*  because in the absence of something horrible like war, [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4322.08s)]
*  martial arts at least gives you adversity on a daily basis. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4325.48s)]
*  It gives you something to test your character [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4329.04s)]
*  on a daily basis. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4331.12s)]
*  Which I think for men, [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4332.5599999999995s)]
*  it's almost like a built-in thing that we need. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4333.88s)]
*  It doesn't have to be jujitsu. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4337.84s)]
*  It could be many, many, many things. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4339.44s)]
*  It could be marathon running and just swimming in the pool, [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4341.16s)]
*  swimming laps in the pool, [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4343.28s)]
*  something that really tests your resolve. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4344.36s)]
*  I think people need that. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4347.8s)]
*  I don't think we feel sane unless we get that. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4349.5199999999995s)]
*  At least I know I don't. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4352.12s)]
*  I don't feel good unless I get that. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4354.08s)]
*  I don't like the energy of people that they give off [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4356.68s)]
*  when they're angry and they don't exercise. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4359.84s)]
*  It's like this, [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4361.72s)]
*  ah! [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4362.56s)]
*  It's like such a, it's overflow. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4364.400000000001s)]
*  It's jam coming out the sides of the jar. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4367.32s)]
*  Yeah, I totally agree. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4370.64s)]
*  Like sports, exercise, martial arts, [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4372.24s)]
*  they're just so important [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4375.16s)]
*  because we used to be hunting animals. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4376.6s)]
*  It's like a dog. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4379.84s)]
*  You have to walk the dog. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4381.6s)]
*  Yeah, you gotta walk the dog. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4382.96s)]
*  The dog's gotta have the exercise. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4383.8s)]
*  If you don't exercise as a human, [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4385.16s)]
*  you're just like, you're not functioning the right way. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4387.0s)]
*  And you don't need to do anything robust or crazy. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4390.44s)]
*  Just a good brisk walk. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4393.4s)]
*  Do yoga, stretch out a little. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4395.84s)]
*  It's so easy. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4398.6s)]
*  You can find YouTube videos on how to do yoga. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4399.44s)]
*  Set your phones down. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4401.44s)]
*  Put a fucking YouTube video on. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4402.96s)]
*  Just do the poses, not that hard. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4405.2s)]
*  Do something. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4408.0s)]
*  It'll help you so much. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4408.92s)]
*  And there's so many people that are just feeling [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4410.12s)]
*  like dog shit and they don't exercise. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4412.12s)]
*  I know it's hard to do, [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4415.280000000001s)]
*  but if you could just get going, [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4417.12s)]
*  it's not gonna help everybody. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4419.400000000001s)]
*  I know there's people with real legitimate medical problems [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4420.64s)]
*  and mental health problems, [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4423.6s)]
*  but for a lot of people, it would improve you. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4425.160000000001s)]
*  A lot of healthy people that are sedentary. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4428.0s)]
*  If you just do something, I'm telling you, [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4430.52s)]
*  if you could force yourself to work out today, [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4432.84s)]
*  you'll feel better. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4436.160000000001s)]
*  You will fucking feel better. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4437.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and sports was always my favorite place [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4439.200000000001s)]
*  to make friends. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4442.320000000001s)]
*  Because it's such a mirror for how that, [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4443.76s)]
*  we were talking about it before the show. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4446.84s)]
*  It's just like the way you train at the gym, [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4448.92s)]
*  the way you play sports is such a true reflection of you [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4451.400000000001s)]
*  that it's the best look at how you would make friendship. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4455.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, watching someone fall apart [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4462.6s)]
*  when they just work out at the gym is very disappointing. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4463.88s)]
*  Like, come on, man. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4466.52s)]
*  I'm so tired. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4468.4400000000005s)]
*  Or like, I have a friend, he comes to train, [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4469.84s)]
*  but he won't spar. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4472.0s)]
*  And I'm like, dude, come on, man. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4474.24s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4476.12s)]
*  Well, unless he doesn't want to get hit. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4478.32s)]
*  Doesn't want to get hit. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4480.719999999999s)]
*  How old is he? [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4482.16s)]
*  Like early 30s. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4483.48s)]
*  Is he doing it for fun, or is he doing it for a workout? [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4485.04s)]
*  Does he never spar? [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4488.48s)]
*  I think he was genuinely curious. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4489.5599999999995s)]
*  He's like a physical therapist, doctor, [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4491.759999999999s)]
*  a good friend of mine, [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4493.5599999999995s)]
*  and he played very competitive football. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4495.679999999999s)]
*  And I don't know, I'm like, is it a lack of vulnerability? [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4498.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4501.719999999999s)]
*  Sparring's cool. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4504.0s)]
*  Sparring is cool, but I wouldn't advise anybody [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4504.84s)]
*  who doesn't want to pursue like a career in fighting, [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4508.5599999999995s)]
*  I wouldn't advise you to spar. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4514.0s)]
*  You should spar to learn how to fight. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4516.5199999999995s)]
*  So this is contradictory, [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4518.36s)]
*  and I'm aware of it while I'm saying it. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4519.88s)]
*  Because if you want to learn how to fight, [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4521.92s)]
*  you have to spar, [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4524.679999999999s)]
*  because you have to be able to time people, [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4525.599999999999s)]
*  you have to understand that it's not a perfect scenario. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4527.32s)]
*  You have to know how to set things up. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4532.08s)]
*  There's a lot to it. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4533.8s)]
*  You gotta be able to respond quickly when you get hit, [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4534.8s)]
*  and you don't wanna lock up. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4537.240000000001s)]
*  That only comes from sparring. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4538.72s)]
*  Like you don't have to experience that from sparring. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4540.12s)]
*  But on the other hand, you're getting hit in the head. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4542.68s)]
*  And getting hit in the head is really fucking bad for you. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4544.64s)]
*  And the more you cannot get hit in the head, the better. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4546.72s)]
*  I agree. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4550.92s)]
*  The thing for me with it is, [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4551.84s)]
*  if you're a fitness boxing person, [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4553.52s)]
*  totally don't spar. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4555.360000000001s)]
*  I get it. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4556.6s)]
*  But if you wanna learn the art of boxing. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4557.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, and he genuinely wants to learn, [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4558.68s)]
*  and he comes and he trains with the good trainers, [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4562.12s)]
*  and I'm like, yo, you're only gonna understand so much [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4564.32s)]
*  without trying this. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4567.4s)]
*  You just spar your trainer [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4568.32s)]
*  who you're not even gonna be able to hit, [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4570.28s)]
*  and he'll just tap you up a little bit. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4572.48s)]
*  Because I think if you wanna understand it [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4574.719999999999s)]
*  as a martial art, quote unquote, [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4576.639999999999s)]
*  you gotta see a few, at least medium live bullets. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4579.04s)]
*  Yeah, I think medium live is a good way to put it. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4584.24s)]
*  But you don't wanna go full clip. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4586.92s)]
*  No. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4588.08s)]
*  The best work that you ever get sparring, [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4589.12s)]
*  I remember when I first came to LA, [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4592.04s)]
*  I started training with this one dude. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4594.88s)]
*  God, I wish I could remember his name. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4597.4s)]
*  It was either Bill or Will. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4598.88s)]
*  It was like 1994. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4600.52s)]
*  And we trained together until the gym went down, [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4602.12s)]
*  and he was one of those guys that would say, [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4604.88s)]
*  hey, if you don't hit me hard, I won't hit you hard. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4606.96s)]
*  So let's just spar, spar technical. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4609.68s)]
*  And he'll go, I'll never hit you hard, don't hit me hard. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4612.84s)]
*  And we had this total, complete, perfect agreement [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4615.36s)]
*  where like, and he would hit you, it would be like this. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4619.32s)]
*  It would be like nothing. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4621.44s)]
*  But you got loose doing that. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4622.799999999999s)]
*  So because there was less consequences, [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4625.0s)]
*  I wasn't worried about getting brain damage and sparring. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4627.799999999999s)]
*  If he hit me, he hit me like this. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4630.36s)]
*  It was nothing. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4632.24s)]
*  And so I had great sessions with this dude. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4633.48s)]
*  And I remember thinking afterwards, [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4635.4s)]
*  I learned more about timing in my sessions with that guy [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4636.759999999999s)]
*  than I probably did sparring anybody [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4640.32s)]
*  that I've ever sparred with ever [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4642.92s)]
*  because we made it so you're learning. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4644.72s)]
*  You're learning the motions. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4648.320000000001s)]
*  And then you occasionally spar hard, occasionally. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4650.16s)]
*  But sparring hard every day, [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4654.04s)]
*  the problem is it fucks your head up, man. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4655.240000000001s)]
*  It's dangerous. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4658.12s)]
*  You get a headache. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4658.96s)]
*  The people I like sparring with [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4660.400000000001s)]
*  are the ones that are much better than me, [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4662.200000000001s)]
*  pros who have no fear of what's coming at them. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4664.280000000001s)]
*  I'm not even gonna really touch them. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4667.84s)]
*  And they'll be nice to you. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4670.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and those are the best sessions [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4671.56s)]
*  because I'm like, oh, that's how hard it is [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4673.92s)]
*  to hit somebody that's good at this. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4675.52s)]
*  When I spar someone near or at my level, [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4677.6s)]
*  that's when it's a war that's unnecessary [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4681.400000000001s)]
*  and my neck hurts. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4684.0s)]
*  Right, that's the same in Jiu Jitsu. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4685.8s)]
*  The thing about Jiu Jitsu is you're not taking punches. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4687.52s)]
*  You already know how to box, [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4691.2s)]
*  but learning Jiu Jitsu would probably be fun for you too. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4692.56s)]
*  What the difference is is that [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4696.320000000001s)]
*  if you roll with a guy, [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4699.68s)]
*  say if you wanted to learn Jiu Jitsu [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4701.08s)]
*  and you rolled with a guy like John Jock Machado, [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4703.8s)]
*  it's a perfect guy for you to roll with [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4706.6s)]
*  because you're never gonna get hurt with that guy. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4708.32s)]
*  He's gonna be in complete control of you [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4710.96s)]
*  and put you in situations and tell you what to do [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4713.08s)]
*  and tell you how to escape, [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4715.12s)]
*  but he's in 100% control of the situation. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4716.28s)]
*  Way more that than a guy like you [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4719.4s)]
*  who's starting out who spazzes out. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4721.8s)]
*  Those guys are dangerous. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4724.04s)]
*  I'm fucking just trying to get you, you son of a. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4725.4800000000005s)]
*  And they go crazy and they're so tense. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4728.12s)]
*  Sometimes they fall on their knees, [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4730.0s)]
*  they blow their ankles out, [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4731.64s)]
*  they fucking strain your neck, they dive on you. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4733.4s)]
*  They go for things. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4737.04s)]
*  And it's because they're trying to get better. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4738.28s)]
*  It's not their fault. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4740.04s)]
*  But you're way better off being with a black belt [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4741.04s)]
*  who's in complete control of the situation. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4743.92s)]
*  You're not gonna get hurt [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4746.12s)]
*  and he even can talk to you along the way. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4747.44s)]
*  Yeah, it's nice when there's a pro. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4749.8s)]
*  And now I'm like, oh, this is why women date older men. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4752.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4755.16s)]
*  Sure, yeah. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4756.84s)]
*  It's like with everything in life, right? [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4758.64s)]
*  Yeah, when my homies are jujitsu rolling with each other, [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4760.32s)]
*  the one's like, oh, fucking, he fucking strained my ankle. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4764.12s)]
*  My knee's all fucked up from that time I rolled with him. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4767.44s)]
*  And I'm like, you shouldn't roll with people at your level. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4769.92s)]
*  Well, even if you roll... [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4773.12s)]
*  The thing is, there's no safe way to do jujitsu. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4775.76s)]
*  You can flow in jujitsu the same way. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4778.36s)]
*  I said that dude Will or Bill, I forget his name. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4781.68s)]
*  Sorry, sorry, Will or Bill from 1994. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4783.84s)]
*  But the same way I sparred with that dude with kickboxing, [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4786.76s)]
*  you could spar with someone like that with jujitsu. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4790.360000000001s)]
*  You just have to have partners that you trust. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4792.88s)]
*  And so Marcelo Garcia talked about that a lot. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4795.12s)]
*  He was saying that in training, [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4797.4400000000005s)]
*  you have to be able to be loose and open your game up. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4798.88s)]
*  And the Gracies talk about that too. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4801.84s)]
*  Henner, he's always talking about keeping it playful. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4804.0s)]
*  And Hieron, they talk about it like that. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4806.360000000001s)]
*  That's the way to learn. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4808.04s)]
*  The way to learn is to have sort of a relaxed game [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4809.12s)]
*  where you're not just fucking trying to smash. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4811.68s)]
*  You're just going through positions and counters [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4814.48s)]
*  and you're moving to better positions [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4817.32s)]
*  and escaping the counter and transitioning to the back. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4819.44s)]
*  And you're doing all these different things, [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4822.44s)]
*  but you're flowing. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4823.5599999999995s)]
*  You're not just trying to kill each other all the time. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4824.919999999999s)]
*  It's just the human ego and also the sense of danger [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4827.24s)]
*  because it's not just like you're losing playing basketball. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4830.28s)]
*  You're losing playing kill you. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4832.96s)]

*  We're playing kill you. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4836.32s)]
*  If a guy like John Jacque Machado gets your back [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4837.599999999999s)]
*  and you're dead, you're a dead person. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4839.839999999999s)]

*  And that game is just, [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4846.120000000001s)]
*  it's the closest that gets you to a survival thing [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4851.280000000001s)]
*  in civilized society. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4856.04s)]
*  Jiu-Jitsu is the closest thing you get to a survival fight [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4858.4400000000005s)]
*  in civilized society. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4863.4400000000005s)]

*  Other than a real one. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4866.92s)]
*  Yeah, no. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4867.76s)]
*  Other than a real fight. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4868.6s)]
*  And people don't like having [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4869.4400000000005s)]
*  that sense of confidence shattered. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4870.280000000001s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4872.400000000001s)]
*  It's destroyed. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4873.88s)]
*  I was watching a video just yesterday of Bourdain. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4874.719999999999s)]
*  He's doing this interview and he was talking about how [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4879.32s)]
*  he had just gotten there right from Jiu-Jitsu [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4882.76s)]
*  to do the interview. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4885.24s)]
*  He's talking about how humiliating it is [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4886.4s)]
*  and how fun it is that he picked up this thing [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4888.76s)]
*  that he would have never tried before at 58 years of age. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4891.5599999999995s)]
*  And he was talking about it as it was happening. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4895.2s)]
*  It was really interesting. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4898.32s)]
*  Like it never worked out. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4899.32s)]
*  Never was a gym rat. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4900.32s)]
*  Never would have thought I'd been into this. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4901.6s)]
*  And then here I am, fucking completely in love with it. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4903.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah, his curiosity for two was like really out of nowhere [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4907.76s)]
*  but it made total sense when you knew him. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4911.4800000000005s)]
*  You know, like it's like, [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4913.64s)]
*  oh he would love something that intense. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4914.4800000000005s)]
*  He likes intensity. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4917.240000000001s)]
*  Also just the courage to change your lifestyle. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4918.64s)]
*  Like he smoked cigarettes and drank constantly [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4921.88s)]
*  and just hit the brakes on all that shit. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4925.04s)]
*  And all of a sudden he had a six pack. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4926.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4928.360000000001s)]
*  You ever see that video of him walking [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4929.280000000001s)]
*  his shirt off? [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4930.56s)]
*  It was crazy. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4931.400000000001s)]
*  I've even seen the videos of him rolling. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4932.240000000001s)]
*  And it's like, you know, a lot of dudes that had to get, [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4933.72s)]
*  like, well he wasn't sober, but getting sober, [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4937.160000000001s)]
*  they replaced the drugs with the Jiu Jitsu a lot of times. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4940.080000000001s)]
*  Because like you said, there's very few things [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4944.4400000000005s)]
*  that can get you into that survival zone [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4946.6s)]
*  that like sometimes drugs do. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4949.52s)]
*  Bring it to your knees. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4951.4400000000005s)]
*  Like Jiu Jitsu can replace some of that shit [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4952.4800000000005s)]
*  or boxing or whatever martial art. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4956.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, no doubt. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4958.240000000001s)]
*  It's just that Jiu Jitsu is a little safer. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4959.2s)]
*  It's safer on the brain. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4961.639999999999s)]
*  There's more data in the tournament. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4962.84s)]
*  He competed in a tournament and won. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4964.92s)]
*  It was a good match too. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4966.88s)]
*  It was, you know, it's one of those things where, [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4968.16s)]
*  you know. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4972.28s)]
*  This was the best. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4973.12s)]
*  To take it on at 58 years old [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4973.96s)]
*  is just an inspiration for everybody. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4976.5599999999995s)]
*  Because it lets you people know, [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4978.72s)]
*  like you can do things when there's no like good time. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4979.88s)]
*  Just do it now, do it now. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4983.48s)]
*  It's good to be becoming a beginner at stuff. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4985.0s)]
*  It's fun. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4987.5599999999995s)]
*  I became an athlete in his 60s this while. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4988.4s)]
*  Amazing. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4990.48s)]
*  Looks ripped. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4991.32s)]
*  Like where was all that? [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4992.32s)]
*  Imagine when he was 25, if he figured it out. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4993.639999999999s)]
*  It would have been a killer. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4997.32s)]
*  But a lot of Jiu Jitsu guys are like him. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=4998.44s)]
*  They're really smart, thoughtful people. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5001.12s)]
*  They're just like, [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5003.16s)]
*  just the whole thing is very misunderstood. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5004.0s)]
*  It's very misunderstood like what it is. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5006.32s)]
*  Yeah, I think people are coming around though. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5008.599999999999s)]
*  It's definitely an art form. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5010.4s)]
*  Like extreme, it's the illest combination [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5011.759999999999s)]
*  of like intelligence, emotionally and in a skill [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5015.0s)]
*  and like survival. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5018.6s)]
*  You know why it's an art form? [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5019.44s)]
*  It's an art form because the people who practice it, [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5020.72s)]
*  when they watch someone, [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5024.12s)]
*  like you ever see Marcelo Garcia? [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5025.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5027.56s)]
*  Marcelo Garcia versus Shaolin. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5028.4s)]
*  I was there for that live in Abu Dhabi, [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5030.88s)]
*  or excuse me, in Brazil. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5033.36s)]
*  It was in Sao Paulo. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5035.56s)]
*  It was when Eddie Bravo had that match with Hoyler Gracie [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5037.76s)]
*  and tapped him out on there. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5041.04s)]
*  And it was the first time [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5042.8s)]
*  that we had ever seen Marcelo Garcia. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5044.12s)]
*  And we were like, holy shit, man. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5046.92s)]
*  Like this guy, he tapped out this guy, Victor Shaolin, [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5049.24s)]
*  who's like a top level Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu black belt [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5052.6s)]
*  with the sickest backtake I've ever seen in my life. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5055.96s)]
*  This rolling back tape take [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5058.92s)]
*  that leads to him strangling Shaolin unconscious. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5061.24s)]
*  It's to this day, one of the wildest transitions [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5064.92s)]
*  in the history. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5067.72s)]
*  We're gonna show it to you right now. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5068.6s)]
*  Find that shit. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5070.56s)]

*  that it's like highest level [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5076.08s)]
*  in one of the most basic moves, [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5078.0s)]
*  which is arm drag, take the back, rear naked choke. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5081.36s)]
*  It's so beautiful. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5085.08s)]
*  Watch that, arm drag, take the back. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5087.8s)]
*  Look at this. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5089.5199999999995s)]

*  I mean, they just keep rolling, and he's got it under, [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5091.8s)]
*  and he just won't let him out. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5095.72s)]
*  He won't let him out. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5097.08s)]
*  And Shaolin is a fucking master dude. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5097.92s)]
*  The fact that he just puts him unconscious like this [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5100.5599999999995s)]
*  is insane. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5102.96s)]
*  And this was his first year competing in Abu Dhabi. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5104.44s)]

*  who just happens to be a straight up assassin. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5116.16s)]
*  Yeah, all the best Jiu-Jitsu dudes I've watched, [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5119.0s)]
*  they're just like this. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5121.44s)]
*  It's just man as a virus. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5122.32s)]
*  It just gets in you. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5124.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5125.759999999999s)]
*  I mean, Marcelo was incredible. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5128.879999999999s)]
*  I even saw him later. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5131.5599999999995s)]
*  They had an Abu Dhabi, I think it was 2015 maybe, somewhere. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5133.24s)]
*  I forget what the year was, but he, [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5138.12s)]
*  no, no, it was earlier than that. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5140.64s)]
*  He tapped out Rico Rodriguez, [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5142.12s)]
*  he used to be the UFC heavyweight champion, [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5144.88s)]
*  and Marcelo's a tiny guy. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5146.52s)]
*  And they had a Jiu-Jitsu match, [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5148.2s)]
*  and he caught Rico in like a heel hook, [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5149.78s)]
*  or some sort of a leg lock, if I remember correctly. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5151.78s)]
*  But he's a tiny guy in comparison to Rico. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5154.96s)]
*  Rico's this fucking huge former heavyweight champion. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5157.04s)]
*  That's how good that dude was. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5160.64s)]
*  I have huge gaps in my UFC, [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5162.64s)]
*  because I watched the Tank Abbot years. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5164.48s)]
*  Like when I was in high school, [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5166.52s)]
*  we would get the tapes, and early Gracie. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5167.72s)]
*  But then I kind of didn't watch again until maybe 2015. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5171.2s)]
*  I was like a gap from 98, 99 to 2015. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5176.72s)]
*  That's interesting. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5179.92s)]
*  You were there for the fun days though. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5181.12s)]
*  That was when it was a wild thing, [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5183.12s)]
*  that was like, you couldn't even talk to people about it. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5184.56s)]
*  No, it was like having the UFC one through eight, [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5186.72s)]
*  or having the kids VHS was collateral back in the day. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5191.88s)]
*  We'd all go to each other's house and be like, [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5196.280000000001s)]
*  oh, you got the fucking UFC fucking tape. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5197.76s)]
*  It's a status symbol. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5199.96s)]
*  It's like shitting in a bucket in Dubai. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5200.88s)]
*  You can get that latest shit in that bucket. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5203.0s)]
*  Like yes, here's your money. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5204.88s)]
*  And I remember, because I was ignorant, [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5206.4800000000005s)]
*  my favorite guy was just Tank Abbot early on. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5208.04s)]
*  Oh, Tank Abbot was a man. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5210.240000000001s)]
*  He was the man. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5211.84s)]
*  Tank Abbot has still, see Tank Abbot versus John Matua. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5212.76s)]
*  This was one of the most, [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5218.42s)]
*  when I saw this on television, I was like, oh my God. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5220.64s)]
*  Like I thought, I didn't think about this aspect [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5225.280000000001s)]
*  of fighting, that you're gonna get this dude [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5227.96s)]
*  who's just like a old time wrestler, [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5231.4400000000005s)]
*  power puncher, loves to drink, [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5234.64s)]
*  and loves to fuck people up. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5236.68s)]
*  And he's like, you know, probably close to 300 pounds, [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5238.52s)]
*  strong as a fucking ox, and he's mean and funny, man. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5241.88s)]
*  He's funny dude, man. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5245.160000000001s)]
*  I got drunk with that guy many times back in the day [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5246.360000000001s)]
*  when we all did shows together. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5248.68s)]
*  This was a good fight, I remember this. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5251.32s)]
*  We had this tape. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5253.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5254.48s)]
*  This is a good fucking fight. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5255.44s)]
*  This was one of the best knockouts [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5256.679999999999s)]
*  in the early days of the UFC. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5259.2s)]
*  Scooter had there to the actual fight. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5261.839999999999s)]
*  That's Michael Buffer, not even Bruce Buffer, [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5264.44s)]
*  interviewing the fighters or announcing the fighters. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5267.5599999999995s)]
*  How crazy is that? [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5271.28s)]
*  So here it is. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5272.919999999999s)]
*  So the fight was very quick. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5275.299999999999s)]
*  And the two of them in the brown, the two of them back up. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5276.84s)]
*  Oh. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5279.04s)]
*  Yup. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5281.4400000000005s)]
*  This is that Tank Abbot Air, I was like, [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5282.28s)]
*  he was my favorite. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5283.56s)]
*  Oh. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5284.76s)]

*  Oh, oh, oh, oh. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5286.4400000000005s)]
*  Like look at that KO. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5290.16s)]
*  Because he was just like bar fighting. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5291.0s)]
*  Looks like he got electrocuted. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5292.52s)]
*  Look at that KO. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5293.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5295.04s)]
*  So that was the first time I'd ever seen that. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5295.88s)]
*  That was the first dab. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5297.56s)]
*  That's the original dab. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5299.4800000000005s)]
*  The original dab. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5300.32s)]
*  That's the first time I ever saw that in the UFC. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5301.64s)]
*  Like the way he did it, I was like, [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5305.0s)]
*  oh, that guy's fucking dangerous. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5307.36s)]
*  And he just reminds you of your homie from high school [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5310.4s)]
*  that could just fucking fight. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5313.12s)]
*  There's always guys like that. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5314.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5315.839999999999s)]

*  the martial artists or whatever. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5317.759999999999s)]
*  Listen, there's always dudes who can just fight [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5319.48s)]
*  if they're big and they take a punch [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5322.36s)]
*  and if they're like this guy, [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5324.12s)]
*  especially if they like to drink. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5325.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, and there was a dude in my high school [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5326.759999999999s)]
*  who was a year younger than me named Dax, [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5328.5599999999995s)]

*  Those guys existed in the Ale Taverns [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5334.96s)]
*  that the Vikings visited fucking 1,000 years ago. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5337.28s)]
*  They were always doing that. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5340.4s)]
*  Those are my favorite fighters. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5341.4800000000005s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5343.4s)]
*  He's making fun of the dooms out of the hole. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5344.24s)]
*  That guy's a savage. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5346.76s)]
*  And he fought some of the legends, [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5347.88s)]
*  legends of the game. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5349.56s)]
*  Tank fought them all. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5350.64s)]
*  Yeah, and he had no grappling. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5351.92s)]
*  Oh, he had a grappling. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5353.64s)]
*  You think so? [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5354.4800000000005s)]
*  100%, he could wrestle. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5355.32s)]
*  Yes, absolutely, he could wrestle. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5356.32s)]
*  Yeah, he just wanted to fuck people up. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5358.08s)]
*  Most of the time he was just fucking people up. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5361.04s)]
*  He wasn't the guy that would like shoot on anybody. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5362.52s)]
*  But he knew how to grapple. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5364.48s)]
*  Okay, fair enough. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5365.44s)]
*  He had a wrestling background. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5366.28s)]
*  But his power punching was fucking ridiculous, man. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5367.88s)]
*  He would flatline people. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5370.8s)]
*  Yeah, because I only saw him just punching and striking. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5372.28s)]
*  Dude, Tank Abbott had some hammers. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5374.88s)]
*  Those early days were so nuts [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5379.0s)]
*  because it was really like a laboratory for martial arts. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5380.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, and we were all just kids, [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5383.72s)]
*  like I can't believe this is legal. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5386.36s)]
*  This is fucking sick. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5388.24s)]
*  It was wild. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5390.8s)]
*  Because people in boxing were never getting fucked up [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5391.64s)]
*  like that. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5394.4400000000005s)]

*  When he leaped down, boom, and smashed him like that, [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5399.72s)]
*  it's like, holy fuck, man. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5402.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, there was some brutal knockouts [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5404.4400000000005s)]
*  in the mismatches of those days [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5406.24s)]
*  because there were certain people that were just so good [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5409.08s)]
*  and other people that just didn't know what to do [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5412.4400000000005s)]
*  with what they were doing. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5414.56s)]
*  You know, like the Marco Huas days. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5416.320000000001s)]
*  Remember that guy? [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5418.72s)]
*  No. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5419.6s)]
*  King of the streets, Marco Huas. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5420.4400000000005s)]
*  Marco Huas was like the first guy [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5422.44s)]
*  that showed the real benefit of being a good leg kicker. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5424.08s)]
*  Like Marco was one of the first guys to show that. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5429.639999999999s)]
*  Maury Smith was another one. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5432.12s)]
*  Maury Smith actually against Tank Abbott [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5433.5599999999995s)]
*  was like a great example. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5436.04s)]
*  Because Tank Abbott was so fucking dangerous, [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5438.4s)]
*  but Maury Smith was a world champion kickboxer [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5440.4s)]
*  and he just fucked Tank's legs up. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5443.04s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't see that fight. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5444.16s)]
*  You won't see that one? [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5445.2s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5446.04s)]
*  I love the early UFC. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5446.879999999999s)]
*  See, you get to find Maury Smith versus Tank Abbott. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5447.719999999999s)]
*  This is a good one. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5450.28s)]
*  Because Maury Smith was the first world class kickboxer [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5451.16s)]
*  that learned how to grapple and how to get up [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5454.08s)]
*  and how to defend off the back. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5458.5199999999995s)]
*  He won the heavyweight champion against Mark Coleman. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5460.64s)]
*  He became the heavyweight champion in an amazing fight. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5464.04s)]
*  Huge underdog coming into that fight. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5466.2s)]
*  Just kicked Mark's legs apart. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5467.68s)]
*  Fuck, so you watched from like the first one [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5469.24s)]
*  and all the way till now. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5471.76s)]
*  Yeah, well the first one I saw was actually the second one. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5473.12s)]
*  It was UFC II, because that was the one that was available. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5475.92s)]
*  I think he's already hurt. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5478.2s)]
*  Yeah, no, he was hurt. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5479.28s)]
*  But Maurice was a vicious leg kicker. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5481.64s)]
*  I mean, fucking vicious. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5483.16s)]
*  And he was a guy who trained a lot with Frank Shamrock. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5484.64s)]
*  Look at that, boom. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5487.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's already really hurt right here. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5488.72s)]
*  The thing is like, you can't stop Maurice [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5490.8s)]
*  from kicking your leg. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5492.64s)]
*  You can't stop it. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5493.64s)]
*  And you're just gonna get battered. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5494.64s)]
*  And look, Big John's like, that's enough, that's enough. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5497.32s)]
*  But Maurice, man, his level of kickboxing [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5500.88s)]
*  was the first time that the heavyweight division [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5503.64s)]
*  ever saw like that kind of kickboxing [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5506.16s)]
*  from an MMA fighter. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5510.2s)]
*  There's Marco Luas, yeah. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5511.2s)]
*  Yeah, the early ones were cool [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5512.44s)]
*  because they felt like Street Fighter. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5513.8s)]
*  Like people had such different styles [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5515.36s)]
*  and like people were like inventing techniques. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5517.4s)]
*  So Marco was just chewing this dude's leg up [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5520.08s)]
*  and he doesn't know how to block, [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5522.44s)]
*  he doesn't know what to do. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5523.599999999999s)]
*  And now he's all fucked up, his leg's not working well. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5524.84s)]
*  So now he's trying to kick Marco back. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5526.92s)]
*  This is Paul Varlins. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5528.599999999999s)]
*  And this is when people all look different. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5529.88s)]
*  Like Marco looks like Rick the model Martel. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5531.92s)]
*  He looks like WWF. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5535.76s)]
*  He's a perfect specimen of manhood. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5537.04s)]
*  Marco Luas was a perfect specimen of manhood at this time. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5540.08s)]
*  Look at him, beautiful physique and vicious leg kicks. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5543.639999999999s)]
*  And Paul Varlins just couldn't take it after a while. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5547.96s)]
*  Look at his left leg, it's just battered and bruised. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5550.44s)]
*  And Marco would just wait [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5553.599999999999s)]
*  and then if he went right leg forward, [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5554.84s)]
*  tack that leg too. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5556.599999999999s)]
*  So he's just fucking his leg up over and over again. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5558.12s)]
*  And Varlins was 300 pounds, man. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5560.48s)]
*  So he invented this in New York City. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5563.96s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5565.8s)]
*  Most certainly didn't invent it. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5567.5599999999995s)]
*  It's Muay Thai. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5569.12s)]
*  But Marco was a Vali Tudo fighter. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5569.96s)]
*  So he was a guy from Brazil. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5572.16s)]
*  And Vali Tudo is, I think it means anything goes. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5573.56s)]
*  And those guys all fought bare knuckle [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5576.92s)]
*  and they all fought in speedos just like that. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5579.52s)]
*  The manliest men that have ever existed. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5582.360000000001s)]
*  Brazilian MMA champions that came over during those days, [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5585.04s)]
*  like Marco, Marco's like the manliest man [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5590.16s)]
*  that's ever existed. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5592.320000000001s)]
*  Dude, I like the old logo too. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5593.64s)]
*  The old logo so fire. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5595.360000000001s)]
*  Oh, it was dope, right? [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5596.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5597.96s)]
*  It feels like some enter the dragon shit. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5599.16s)]
*  Like the ultimate fighting championship. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5601.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5603.76s)]
*  Yeah, Marco Huas was a legend. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5604.8s)]
*  He used to teach in Beverly Hills too. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5607.04s)]
*  No way. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5609.68s)]
*  He used to teach at Beverly Hills Jiu Jitsu. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5610.52s)]
*  Yeah, during that time. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5611.56s)]
*  You have a train room? [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5612.4s)]
*  No, I did not, no. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5613.22s)]
*  But I went there down there once [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5614.08s)]
*  because Boss Rutan was doing something [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5615.96s)]
*  and it was pretty cool. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5617.6s)]
*  They developed, I don't know if it's still around anymore, [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5619.24s)]
*  but they developed like a real high level, [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5621.36s)]
*  the early days of MMA. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5624.4800000000005s)]
*  A high level camp down there. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5626.759999999999s)]
*  Pedro Hizo was working out there and Boss Rutan [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5628.759999999999s)]
*  and a bunch of other really top level guys. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5631.36s)]
*  And it was in Beverly Hills. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5633.839999999999s)]
*  It was pretty cool. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5635.04s)]
*  Yeah, no, I'm gonna go home and watch the old tapes [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5636.719999999999s)]
*  because I used to love them, man. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5639.12s)]
*  Well, the thing about the UFC that's really weird [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5640.92s)]
*  is that it's the only sport in our lifetime [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5643.0199999999995s)]
*  that's gotten way better. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5645.2s)]
*  The athletes of today, the fighters of today, [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5647.839999999999s)]
*  in comparison to some of the people that fought [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5651.08s)]
*  in the very early days of the UFC, [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5652.92s)]
*  there's no comparison. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5654.599999999999s)]
*  Whereas if you compare football, [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5655.68s)]
*  you're a football fan, right? [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5657.68s)]
*  How much different are people from the year 2005 [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5659.72s)]
*  to the year 2023? [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5664.400000000001s)]
*  They're not at the level of UFC. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5667.52s)]
*  They're faster, they're stronger. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5670.52s)]
*  Is it slight improvements? [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5672.280000000001s)]
*  It's slight and gradual and you can see it. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5674.0s)]
*  And basketball too. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5677.56s)]
*  Steph Curry, I think, is the evolution [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5679.3s)]
*  of the superstar basketball player. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5682.8s)]
*  He can do shit nobody else could do before. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5684.5199999999995s)]
*  But then even in basketball, [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5687.5199999999995s)]
*  people are like Jordan's the best ever. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5688.879999999999s)]
*  So UFC, you have dudes every year [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5690.5599999999995s)]
*  that are just like, it just keeps getting better [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5694.2s)]
*  and better and better. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5696.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5697.36s)]
*  I've never seen a sport like it [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5698.179999999999s)]
*  where the people that are the best right now, [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5699.44s)]
*  they're so much better than like 1993. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5702.0s)]
*  Like if you watch these early days, [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5705.599999999999s)]
*  the guys are wearing geese [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5707.5599999999995s)]
*  and they don't know what they're doing. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5708.82s)]
*  They're wearing shoes, no shoes, bare knuckle. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5709.839999999999s)]
*  Maybe you wear like knuckle covers. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5713.04s)]
*  Yeah, cause through the span of the sport, [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5715.28s)]
*  people started to see a consensus develop [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5717.24s)]
*  of like that works, that doesn't work. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5720.12s)]
*  And like in the beginning, people, [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5722.44s)]
*  you have your beliefs, you have your opinions, [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5724.82s)]
*  but by the end, it's like the consensus usually wins out. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5726.6s)]
*  Yeah, the consensus usually wins out. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5729.76s)]
*  It's just like you find out what's effective [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5732.0s)]
*  with different styles. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5734.82s)]
*  And you realize like one style is totally effective [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5736.72s)]
*  if you do this, but totally ineffective if you do that. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5740.12s)]
*  And then people figure that out. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5743.32s)]
*  They start kicking calves, they start taking people down, [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5744.68s)]
*  they start making them stand up. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5747.24s)]
*  There's so many different things that you learn [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5749.44s)]
*  through the progression of these guys [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5752.16s)]
*  and trying to figure out what's, and girls, [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5754.08s)]
*  trying to figure out what works and what doesn't work. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5756.24s)]
*  And then the new people get to learn [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5758.4s)]
*  all that stuff in advance. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5759.68s)]
*  So the new people like these new 17 and 18 year olds, [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5760.84s)]
*  they're terrifying. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5763.88s)]
*  Cause they're coming in like full ninja skills on the ground, [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5765.36s)]
*  wicked kickboxing skills, standing up. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5769.599999999999s)]
*  They can do everything. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5771.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's beautiful to watch truth [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5772.719999999999s)]
*  or just the consensus win out in a microcosm like the UFC. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5776.599999999999s)]
*  And I just wish that our greater life could be like that. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5781.12s)]
*  Cause you see certain things win out, [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5784.08s)]
*  but then we can never agree. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5785.679999999999s)]
*  It's like they won, right? [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5787.24s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, they didn't. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5788.08s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, that didn't happen. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5789.4s)]
*  Somebody wrote, was it Bill Maher? [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5791.759999999999s)]
*  Maybe it was Bill Maher. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5796.639999999999s)]
*  Someone was talking about how sports [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5797.56s)]
*  is our last meritocracy. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5799.04s)]
*  I saw it was the cover of an article [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5800.84s)]
*  or something like that. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5802.76s)]
*  I would agree. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5803.92s)]
*  Or the title of a video perhaps. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5804.76s)]
*  I remember seeing it going, well, [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5806.52s)]
*  there's certain sports where there's no room for bullshit [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5808.4400000000005s)]
*  and fighting is 100% one of them. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5811.56s)]
*  There's no room for bullshit. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5813.8s)]
*  It's like, it is what it is. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5815.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah, like the books like Field of Dreams, [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5816.52s)]
*  Shoeless Joe Jackson, they kind of present the case [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5818.4400000000005s)]
*  that like sports is the last or only meritocracy [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5821.04s)]
*  where like there are rules and boundaries [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5825.200000000001s)]
*  and like truths shake out. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5827.84s)]
*  You shake the dice enough, the truth, [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5828.84s)]
*  it'll be there every time. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5831.04s)]
*  Yeah, and if you're all competing [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5832.599999999999s)]
*  within a certain rule set and parameters, [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5835.48s)]
*  you really get to find out everything. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5838.04s)]
*  How, who's mind works better? [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5840.76s)]
*  Who's body works better? [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5843.08s)]
*  Who's faster? [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5844.04s)]
*  Who's meaner? [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5844.88s)]
*  Who's this? [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5845.72s)]
*  Who's that? [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5846.54s)]
*  Who's more creative? [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5847.38s)]
*  Who's more, and they all express themselves [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5848.2s)]
*  through this game. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5850.24s)]
*  Yeah, and that's- [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5851.12s)]
*  It's so important. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5852.4s)]
*  Yeah, I think you would like this book [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5853.84s)]
*  called Shoeless Joe Jackson and it became Field of Dreams, [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5855.48s)]
*  but the book is really about the White Sox cheating scandal. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5858.679999999999s)]
*  Oh, right. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5862.36s)]
*  And why this fictional character takes it so hard [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5864.44s)]
*  because it's like sports is the last bastion [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5867.04s)]
*  where truth shakes out. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5869.679999999999s)]
*  So when you have cheating in sports, [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5871.78s)]
*  it's like the greatest lie to this guy. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5873.839999999999s)]
*  It's dope. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5877.679999999999s)]
*  It could apply to the UFC, you know. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5878.5199999999995s)]
*  That is true, right? [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5880.799999999999s)]
*  Like cheating to win in sports, [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5881.96s)]
*  but then this, if you ain't cheating, you ain't trying. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5883.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5886.72s)]
*  It's like literally living in the Great Depression. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5887.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5891.4400000000005s)]
*  The fuck are you talking about, bro? [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5892.28s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5893.4s)]
*  Chomping on a cigar. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5894.24s)]
*  Yeah, I ain't cheating, I ain't trying, kid. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5895.08s)]
*  Fucking, fucking Canelo, man. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5897.8s)]
*  I don't know if he's cheating. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5899.56s)]
*  What do you mean? [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5900.76s)]
*  I feel like Canelo juices, but I'm a Triple G fan, [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5901.96s)]
*  so I'm a, you know, say that ahead of time. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5905.28s)]
*  I just like Triple G. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5908.04s)]
*  There's a lot of money on the line [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5908.88s)]
*  and if I could get away with it, I would do it as well. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5910.8s)]
*  I think, well, he definitely got busted once for something, [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5914.76s)]
*  but it could have been from Tainted Beef. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5918.32s)]
*  We don't know, but it also could be that, you know, [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5921.24s)]
*  we should probably leave them the fuck alone [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5925.360000000001s)]
*  and let them do whatever they want to do. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5927.04s)]
*  Do you want to see Manny Pacquiao fight or not, right? [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5928.68s)]
*  I want to see him juiced up, fighting at 45 years of age, [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5931.16s)]
*  coming in with a full six pack, lighting people on fire. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5933.96s)]
*  Why not? [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5936.76s)]
*  Let him juice. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5937.72s)]
*  If he doesn't, you can't decide what he can and can't do. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5938.56s)]
*  I agree. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5944.52s)]
*  We got science on our side. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5945.360000000001s)]
*  I agree. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5946.96s)]
*  I'm just the Canelo hater, because I'm a Triple G fan, [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5947.8s)]
*  but I agree, it's like steroids don't make you a better boxer. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5950.84s)]
*  They definitely help. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5954.2s)]
*  They help, they help. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5955.68s)]
*  They help a lot. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5956.76s)]
*  They help a lot, which is why they're illegal. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5957.92s)]
*  But I think that we should probably revisit that [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5959.68s)]
*  when it comes to older athletes for sure. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5962.32s)]
*  Because do you want to see like people compete [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5964.64s)]
*  into their old, if they want to, you know, [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5967.24s)]
*  especially in some sports where, you know, [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5969.96s)]
*  they're not getting hit, you know? [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5972.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5973.92s)]
*  I mean, I think, [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5974.76s)]
*  I don't know what kind of testing they do for the NBA, [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5975.599999999999s)]
*  but I would imagine that in order to compete [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5978.5199999999995s)]
*  at the highest level, what does it say? [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5981.8s)]
*  A report, Major League Baseball stops testing for steroids [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5983.36s)]
*  after drug agreement with players expires. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5986.599999999999s)]
*  And then the whole record starts moving. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5989.4s)]
*  They want to put on a show. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5991.0s)]
*  Let's go, let's fucking go. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5992.44s)]
*  Let's go back to knocking them into the fucking parking lot. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=5994.5599999999995s)]

*  It's not good for the game. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6023.719999999999s)]
*  Well, I like that basketball, [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6024.96s)]

*  The thing about weed and anything that's feel [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6039.32s)]
*  is that it accentuates your feel. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6042.799999999999s)]
*  Like you feel more, if that makes any sense at all. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6045.879999999999s)]
*  Like when you work out on jujitsu, [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6049.5199999999995s)]
*  like if you do jujitsu while you're high, [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6052.679999999999s)]
*  it feels like you're more focused. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6055.879999999999s)]
*  Like the world doesn't exist. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6058.68s)]
*  You just try to not get choked [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6060.4800000000005s)]
*  or trying to move into a better position. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6062.04s)]
*  You're like completely locked into this thing. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6063.64s)]
*  It's very, very common that guys get high and do jujitsu. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6065.8s)]
*  In fact, there's like a Brazilian jujitsu championship, [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6070.4400000000005s)]
*  high rollers where they all get high as fuck. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6073.68s)]
*  And then they go- [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6075.76s)]
*  I gotta see this shit. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6077.16s)]

*  Play it for him. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6080.0s)]
*  That's a good name. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6080.820000000001s)]
*  It's my friend Matt's. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6081.66s)]
*  Actually, I think he sold it. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6082.5s)]
*  But the point is it's like, [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6083.72s)]
*  it's a great connection that marijuana [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6085.64s)]
*  and jujitsu has always had. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6088.12s)]
*  Because jujitsu kind of operates a lot on feel. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6089.200000000001s)]
*  Obviously there's some people that don't agree with this. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6092.280000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of people that think drugs are bad. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6094.56s)]
*  And a lot of people think that jujitsu is for, [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6096.360000000001s)]
*  you know, children love jujitsu too. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6098.64s)]
*  We shouldn't introduce them to this. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6100.4400000000005s)]
*  And you're right, you shouldn't do it if you're a kid. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6101.76s)]
*  You shouldn't do it until you're an adult. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6104.400000000001s)]
*  But once you're an adult- [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6106.0s)]
*  Kids don't do drugs. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6107.320000000001s)]
*  Once you're an adult, it's the best one at all of them. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6109.04s)]
*  And it's really good for certain sports. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6112.12s)]
*  It's great for, apparently basketball, [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6114.0s)]
*  but it's great for pool. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6115.96s)]
*  When you play pool when you're high, [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6117.88s)]
*  you can feel where that ball's going. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6119.84s)]
*  It's weird. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6122.28s)]
*  You get into a zone. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6123.16s)]
*  It's very interesting. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6125.08s)]
*  Because you get into what they call, [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6126.28s)]
*  there's a thing about pool called dead stroke. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6128.76s)]
*  That's when you play so, [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6131.16s)]
*  you know exactly where the ball's going. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6132.4800000000005s)]
*  You make it, it feels like you can get more to that [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6134.72s)]
*  with weed. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6139.36s)]
*  This is incredible, huh? [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6140.84s)]

*  So they have these jujitsu matches [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6144.96s)]
*  while they're baked as fuck. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6147.16s)]
*  It's really wild. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6149.12s)]
*  And the whole crowd gets to watch them. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6150.44s)]
*  That's Matt, he's the guy who created it. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6154.2s)]
*  And these are like, they have like fucking cool crowds. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6155.92s)]

*  Nick Diaz is there. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6160.2s)]
*  The weed makes sense. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6161.32s)]
*  Now imagine if they were smoking meth. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6162.4s)]
*  That would be crazy. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6164.64s)]

*  Adderall, I mean, yeah. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6184.96s)]
*  It seems dangerous. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6186.28s)]
*  Adderall definitely helps. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6187.84s)]
*  Seems dangerous. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6191.4s)]
*  It is dangerous. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6193.36s)]
*  Like I can't imagine giving it to a kid [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6194.2s)]
*  because they prescribe it to like children with ADD. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6196.72s)]
*  But I definitely remember, I like took the, [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6199.8s)]
*  well, so when I was a kid, I got taken out of school. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6203.24s)]

*  They took me to a therapist and they gave me a gifted test [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6208.72s)]
*  because she's like, I think you might be like high IQ, [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6212.4400000000005s)]
*  whatever, you're just doing weird stuff in school. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6214.56s)]

*  And I did the untimed test and I scored off the charts. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6227.28s)]
*  And she's like, you have issues with attention and time. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6230.08s)]
*  And I think she recommended that I was on medicine, [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6234.719999999999s)]
*  but my mom was a very like anti-medicine person. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6237.4s)]

*  Well, not just boundaries, but it seems like what they're [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6276.240000000001s)]
*  saying is, if they're saying you have problems with time [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6280.400000000001s)]

*  And it's like, it's better for multiple choice. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6299.64s)]
*  As a lemming, you just nailed it. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6302.52s)]
*  Imagine being a mother. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6303.96s)]
*  You know, like my child is medicated. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6305.56s)]
*  Why is your child medicated? [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6308.36s)]
*  Well, she's too fucking smart. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6309.76s)]
*  Scored off the charts. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6311.4s)]
*  So they gave him speed. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6312.64s)]
*  Now he just makes weapons. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6313.92s)]
*  She tried to frame it as the doctor. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6316.4400000000005s)]
*  I remember it being like, oh, he needs help with time and rules. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6319.52s)]
*  Bro, they were going to hook you up with the good shit. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6324.04s)]
*  Thank god my mom though stepped in. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6326.68s)]
*  Yeah, thank god your mom stepped in. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6328.24s)]
*  But then to do like regular social shit, [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6330.4800000000005s)]
*  it helps, like an LSAT, like a standardized test. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6332.56s)]
*  I scored significantly higher taking Adderall. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6335.32s)]
*  I could imagine. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6338.36s)]
*  I'm terrified of that shit. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6339.36s)]
*  I haven't tried it, but I want to. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6341.0s)]
*  But I don't. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6342.84s)]
*  Because I'm like, oh no. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6344.92s)]
*  Because someone is describing ADD or ADHD. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6346.8s)]
*  They're just describing what happens to them. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6350.4400000000005s)]
*  They really can't focus on things. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6353.04s)]
*  And then when they take Adderall, they focus. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6354.4800000000005s)]
*  But is that a diagnosis? [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6360.6s)]
*  The idea that there's, like when we're [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6363.12s)]
*  talking about what drugs are legal and illegal, [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6364.92s)]
*  that's a real drug. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6367.12s)]
*  That's a real one. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6368.64s)]
*  That's a real one. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6370.08s)]
*  I'm not against it. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6372.48s)]
*  But I'm just flabbergasted at the ones [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6373.959999999999s)]
*  that people without question allow, [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6377.36s)]
*  but the ones they don't allow. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6381.04s)]
*  Yeah, so the thing for me, this is my feeling [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6382.639999999999s)]
*  about cognitive disorders, like ADHD, things of that nature. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6385.04s)]
*  Not too serious. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6390.4s)]
*  But for every something like ADHD that has a negative, [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6391.5599999999995s)]
*  I did see a positive creatively. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6397.919999999999s)]
*  There are days where we were doing overnight shoots [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6401.200000000001s)]
*  on the movie Boogie. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6403.6s)]
*  And I had trouble staying up on the overnight shoots. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6405.4800000000005s)]
*  So I was popping ads when we flipped to the overnights [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6409.4800000000005s)]
*  the first three to five days. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6412.4400000000005s)]
*  I will tell you, I was much more of a soldier, much more [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6414.76s)]
*  like, buy the book, do this. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6418.92s)]
*  But when I went back, I was overly positive [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6421.56s)]
*  about a few of those scenes. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6424.6s)]
*  You know what it's like? [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6427.88s)]
*  Showgirls. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6430.44s)]
*  Showgirls is a cocaine movie. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6431.24s)]
*  Yeah, the one with the girl from Saved by the Bell. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6435.96s)]
*  I don't know if they're doing cocaine [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6438.2s)]
*  when they're making Showgirls. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6441.16s)]
*  I'm not saying that, but I'm saying [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6442.679999999999s)]
*  if you were going to make a movie on coke [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6444.36s)]
*  and you thought it was good and everybody else was like, [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6446.48s)]
*  what the fuck, that would be Showgirls. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6449.32s)]
*  Not saying they were on coke, but I am saying [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6452.719999999999s)]
*  it seems like a movie made by people who are on coke. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6455.24s)]
*  Yo, definitely I look and I'm like, [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6458.8s)]
*  tone is a little different. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6460.84s)]
*  And I'm not the first director, I'm not fucking [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6462.12s)]
*  stabbing myself, Hari Kiri here, you know what I mean? [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6464.56s)]
*  I think a lot of directors, they smoke weed [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6467.84s)]
*  or they do whatever. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6469.68s)]
*  On overnights I took a few ads, but like. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6470.96s)]
*  Does it make you just have a distorted perception [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6473.84s)]
*  of how good the work is? [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6477.360000000001s)]
*  I felt it was slightly more positive than I normally am. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6479.280000000001s)]
*  And at first I thought it was a benefit to be like, [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6482.280000000001s)]
*  I'm more positive because people around me are always like, [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6484.12s)]
*  take it easy, relax. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6487.8s)]
*  But I felt, I wasn't as critical as I usually was [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6489.76s)]
*  and I missed the critical lens. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6494.400000000001s)]
*  I think as a director you gotta stay critical. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6497.76s)]
*  Yeah, that's the beauty of the marijuana mindset, right? [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6500.72s)]
*  Because you do get sort of self critical [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6505.12s)]
*  and critical about your work in a more objective way. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6508.16s)]
*  You start looking at things and looking at cracks in it, [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6512.0s)]
*  holes in it. Yeah. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6514.28s)]
*  Everything's a balance, but that's what I mean to say [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6515.48s)]
*  with the ADHD, I was like, for everything you say [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6517.719999999999s)]
*  is negative about this, there's a positive. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6520.36s)]
*  And taking the medicine, there's a negative and a positive. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6523.0s)]
*  But me personally, I don't wanna make art on Adderall. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6525.839999999999s)]
*  You know, like, I probably wouldn't. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6529.28s)]
*  Do you have any concern that, with what's going on with AI, [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6531.24s)]
*  that it's gonna completely take the legs out [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6536.04s)]
*  from a lot of artists? [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6540.5199999999995s)]
*  Like if you think about what they're doing with AI [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6542.16s)]
*  with the ability to write things, it can write stories. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6543.88s)]
*  You could ask it to write a story for you. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6547.04s)]
*  It can do code. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6549.56s)]
*  You can make it have fake images of things [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6551.2s)]
*  that have never really happened [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6554.2s)]
*  and they're kinda realistic. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6555.4800000000005s)]
*  Do you see the Megalodon one that I posted? [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6557.2s)]
*  The CGI one? Yeah, that was wild. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6559.84s)]
*  Put that up, because let's credit that dude, [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6562.08s)]
*  whoever makes it, because this is insane. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6564.4800000000005s)]
*  How the fuck this guy does this? [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6566.32s)]
*  But there's a guy, whatever his Instagram page is, [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6568.68s)]
*  I reposted it yesterday. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6573.5199999999995s)]
*  He did a CGI of a Megalodon attacking a boat [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6574.839999999999s)]
*  and then fucking up a helicopter. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6578.839999999999s)]
*  It's so crazy how real it looks. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6580.5199999999995s)]
*  Look how goddamn, give me some volume on that [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6584.04s)]
*  so we could hear it, [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6586.16s)]
*  because he's got sound effects in it too. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6587.2s)]
*  Yeah, this is crazy. [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6588.919999999999s)]
*  This is nuts, man. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6590.36s)]
*  Look at this. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6591.48s)]
*  It's getting really close to looking real. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6593.48s)]
*  You can still tell it's AI, but it's getting close. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6596.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, it's getting very close. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6599.36s)]
*  Look at this. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6601.24s)]
*  I mean, bro. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6604.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6606.2s)]
*  If this was a scene in a movie, you'd be like, [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6607.36s)]
*  holy shit. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6608.879999999999s)]
*  It's close to movie quality. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6612.24s)]
*  This looks like the Meg. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6613.919999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's very close. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6615.16s)]
*  I'm personally- [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6618.08s)]
*  That's amazing. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6619.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6621.0s)]
*  It's fucking amazing. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6621.839999999999s)]
*  That's computer generated. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6622.679999999999s)]
*  It's nuts. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6623.839999999999s)]
*  I'm not threatened by it, [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6627.16s)]
*  but I feel like certain people, [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6628.679999999999s)]
*  if you're like an assignment rider [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6630.759999999999s)]
*  or an assignment director or special effects guy, [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6632.6s)]
*  maybe, I feel like the really good special effects people [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6636.72s)]
*  are not worried, but like, you know- [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6639.360000000001s)]
*  I think they should be worried. [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6642.52s)]
*  The thing that AI can't replicate [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6644.4800000000005s)]
*  is not your actual physical voice sonically, [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6647.160000000001s)]
*  but you're like, the just way your brain is gonna move [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6651.240000000001s)]
*  and the choices you're gonna make, [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6654.64s)]
*  your actual literary voice, [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6655.96s)]
*  I don't think the machine can replicate that. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6658.120000000001s)]
*  But what if it can? [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6662.24s)]
*  If it can. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6664.24s)]
*  Here's the thing, it's like, [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6665.08s)]
*  what if this thing that we think is unique [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6665.92s)]
*  is really just like patterns, [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6667.599999999999s)]
*  and we could accurately predict those patterns [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6669.5199999999995s)]
*  if we have a certain amount of your life history. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6672.4s)]
*  We can keep it within a certain range. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6676.08s)]
*  Like what if you came home one day [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6680.36s)]
*  and your wife replaced you with a robot [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6682.5599999999995s)]
*  that looks exactly like you, [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6684.48s)]
*  but it's programmed perfectly? [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6686.24s)]
*  You know how weird that would be? [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6689.639999999999s)]
*  It's definitely- [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6690.599999999999s)]
*  But imagine being like some douchebag banker guy, [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6691.599999999999s)]
*  and you come home and your wife goes, [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6694.48s)]
*  come on in, there's someone I want you to meet. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6697.839999999999s)]
*  And she shuts the door, [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6699.879999999999s)]
*  and then you come from around the corner staring at you, [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6701.0s)]
*  and she's like, I am tired of your bullshit, [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6705.44s)]
*  and I can just keep you around without having you around. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6707.839999999999s)]
*  And he'll do whatever the fuck I say. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6712.2s)]
*  It's a horror movie. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6714.5599999999995s)]
*  So I think it is a horror movie, [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6715.4s)]
*  but it's also a double-edged sword. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6717.2s)]
*  Like with everything we're talking about today, [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6718.639999999999s)]
*  I think if it actually happened, [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6721.72s)]
*  I would be pretty pissed [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6723.04s)]
*  if there was a robot fucking my wife. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6724.5199999999995s)]
*  I would be pissed. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6726.16s)]
*  Bro, well. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6727.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6728.84s)]
*  Ha ha ha ha ha. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6729.68s)]
*  He's you, but he never gets tired. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6731.5599999999995s)]
*  He doesn't even eat food. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6736.0s)]
*  Here's the thing I think about with people, [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6737.2s)]
*  is I think the most distinctive, specific thing [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6739.68s)]
*  that makes us who we are is your actual human spirit. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6743.8s)]
*  Now, for the AI to replicate that, [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6747.04s)]
*  that would mean that your human spirit [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6750.2s)]
*  has a signature and a code that can actually be codified. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6752.84s)]
*  That's what we're asking. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6757.32s)]
*  Can the human spirit be codified, [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6759.08s)]
*  or is it actually random and organic and unpredictable [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6761.639999999999s)]
*  in this way that we've been thought to believe [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6766.92s)]
*  and like existentially? [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6769.12s)]
*  So if the AI can replicate the human spirit, [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6771.0s)]
*  and if the human spirit can be codified, [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6774.8s)]
*  there is a silver lining in it for me personally [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6777.32s)]
*  where I'm like, oh, then I'm not distinct, [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6779.64s)]
*  and there is not like a destiny, [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6784.92s)]
*  and I can just enjoy my life until I die [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6788.0s)]
*  because there's nothing unique about me. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6791.92s)]
*  And also you might already be in a simulation. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6795.360000000001s)]
*  You might already be in some sort of a computer program. [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6798.320000000001s)]
*  It seems preposterous, [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6801.6s)]
*  but the whole world should be preposterous to you. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6803.52s)]
*  It should seem crazy [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6805.92s)]
*  that we're on the brink of nuclear war. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6808.52s)]
*  It should seem crazy that we're counting down the days [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6810.360000000001s)]
*  till the iPhone 15 comes out, [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6812.72s)]
*  super excited about its launch. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6814.68s)]
*  Like, what are we doing? [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6816.68s)]
*  All of this crazy. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6817.72s)]
*  Yeah, if each individual person could be codified [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6819.360000000001s)]
*  into like a QR code of your human spirit, [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6822.8s)]
*  when we're asleep in one night, [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6825.120000000001s)]
*  a computer could simulate 3,000 years of human civilization. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6827.400000000001s)]
*  Easily. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6832.200000000001s)]
*  It could literally do that. Probably more. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6833.040000000001s)]
*  Because it would probably create a better computer [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6834.080000000001s)]
*  that has even more capacity and more capability. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6836.36s)]
*  And then if it did that, [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6840.0s)]
*  then what's not to say like it can manipulate time and space. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6841.12s)]
*  Now that's the next, can you manipulate time and space? [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6844.0s)]
*  Of course you can. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6847.28s)]
*  You just have to figure out how, [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6848.24s)]
*  and we're not close to that yet. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6849.92s)]
*  But if we're close to making something that figures it out, [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6851.5599999999995s)]
*  that makes more sense. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6854.12s)]
*  Right now we're manipulating existence. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6856.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6858.639999999999s)]
*  So then the question is, [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6859.599999999999s)]
*  can existence be boiled down to a code? [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6862.08s)]
*  I think that's the question of this era, [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6864.28s)]
*  and this generation right now. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6866.92s)]
*  And also the ability to travel to anywhere, [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6868.2s)]
*  the ability to rewrite your genetics, [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6870.8s)]
*  to reverse aging, stop it dead in its tracks, [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6873.0s)]
*  cure diseases, regrow limbs. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6876.72s)]
*  I mean, there are on the verge [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6878.68s)]
*  of some pretty wild physical discoveries too. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6880.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6882.88s)]
*  There's a lot of stuff that's happening simultaneously, [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6883.72s)]
*  like all over the world. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6886.12s)]
*  And then on top of that, AI is emerging. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6887.96s)]
*  And the people, I mean, [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6891.4s)]
*  I don't know enough about this to really comment [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6893.48s)]
*  on this, I mean, silly, but the people that don't know [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6895.2s)]
*  what's going to happen, who are educated in it, [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6900.8s)]
*  they're scaring the shit out of me. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6903.4s)]
*  The people that don't know, the people like... [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6905.28s)]
*  See, why are you scared? [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6907.04s)]
*  So, and not to be like, why are you scared? [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6908.68s)]
*  I don't wanna say it like that. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6910.88s)]
*  Say it. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6911.72s)]
*  No, for me, the thing... [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6912.5599999999995s)]
*  Because I'm a bitch, Eddie, I'm a bitch. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6913.4s)]
*  No, man, no, it's not like that. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6914.36s)]
*  I meant it this way in that, [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6916.24s)]
*  existentially, if we're meaningless, [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6918.12s)]
*  I think the way that people have organized society [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6921.88s)]
*  and tribalism, culture, everything, [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6926.0s)]
*  is to say there is a meaning to life. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6926.84s)]
*  It's in your best interest to assume [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6929.12s)]
*  that there is a meaning to your life. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6930.84s)]
*  To not assume that would be like, ooh, that could be sad. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6932.92s)]
*  But if your life actually doesn't have meaning, [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6936.5599999999995s)]
*  maybe it's even more fun. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6940.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6942.48s)]
*  Who knows? [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6943.5599999999995s)]
*  There's a possibility to that. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6944.88s)]
*  And there's also, there's the inevitable. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6946.28s)]
*  Whether you freak out or not, [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6948.88s)]
*  this stuff is moving in a very specific direction. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6952.32s)]
*  It's not moving in a place where it's gonna slow down [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6955.16s)]
*  and go back to the Stone Age. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6958.56s)]
*  The only thing that's gonna happen, if that happens, [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6960.4800000000005s)]
*  we're either gonna blow ourselves up [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6963.12s)]
*  or we're gonna get hit by something [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6964.64s)]
*  or it's gonna be a super volcano. [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6966.4800000000005s)]
*  One of those things, or some melt, [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6968.0s)]
*  some other natural disaster, something big, [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6969.96s)]
*  that's the only way we get out of this [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6972.8s)]
*  without becoming bionic. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6974.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6976.76s)]
*  The only way we get out of this without becoming cyborgs [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6978.400000000001s)]
*  or without it taking over the world, [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6981.32s)]
*  it's like that's where it's going. [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6984.0s)]
*  If I had to bet on it, like what happens at the end? [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6986.36s)]
*  I think we're gonna realize that the final hour [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6989.599999999999s)]
*  that there is meaning to life, [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6992.12s)]
*  that there was something to accomplish [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6993.5199999999995s)]
*  and there was something to do, but we were too late. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6996.4s)]
*  Because I do feel, at least my body and my emotions, [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=6998.4s)]
*  that life is consistently bittersweet. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7002.48s)]
*  That's usually the feeling I take away from experiences. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7006.759999999999s)]
*  I'm like, it's bittersweet. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7009.639999999999s)]
*  There's pleasure and pain. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7012.04s)]
*  There's agony and ecstasy. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7012.88s)]
*  And I think as a civilization, at the very end, [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7013.72s)]
*  we'll probably realize there was a lot of meaning [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7017.16s)]
*  that we didn't pay enough attention to. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7020.32s)]
*  Perhaps, perhaps. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7022.679999999999s)]
*  I think that search for meaning also propels us [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7025.0s)]
*  in a very specific direction [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7027.599999999999s)]
*  and all the things that we're interested in, [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7029.5199999999995s)]
*  whether it's acquiring new things [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7032.88s)]
*  or whether it's electronics, technology, the internet, [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7035.599999999999s)]
*  exchange of information, it's all powered by technology, [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7039.76s)]
*  all of it. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7042.6s)]
*  And the technology is what we really make. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7043.4400000000005s)]
*  Everything else is sort of like this motivating factor, [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7046.320000000001s)]
*  this engine that creates revenue [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7049.04s)]
*  that makes the technology get born. [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7051.84s)]
*  That's what the fuck is really going on. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7054.4800000000005s)]
*  We're making ultimate tech [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7055.96s)]
*  and the ultimate, ultimate technology is artificial life. [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7057.76s)]
*  Yeah, because I do feel there's even less time [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7061.360000000001s)]
*  in this specific generation of the last five or six years [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7063.92s)]
*  devoted to meaning. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7067.2s)]
*  It's just how do we move forward? [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7070.12s)]
*  How do we legislate? [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7071.44s)]
*  How do we create boundaries and rules and safe spaces, [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7073.04s)]
*  which is like, this is all important stuff we're doing. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7075.879999999999s)]
*  But it's like, what happened to the discussion of meaning? [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7078.679999999999s)]
*  And like, when you were a kid, did you have hope? [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7083.08s)]
*  Or like, even let's say your 20s, [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7086.24s)]
*  did you have hope for people in civilization? [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7088.08s)]
*  When I was in my 20s, I barely thought about it, [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7090.759999999999s)]
*  because all I was thinking about [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7093.4s)]
*  was trying to make it as a comedian and I was poor [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7094.839999999999s)]
*  and I was just trying to fucking do gigs. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7098.16s)]
*  And I was so self-centered in the worst way in that. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7100.04s)]
*  Like, I didn't know what was going on in the world. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7104.76s)]
*  I didn't know shit about politics. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7106.96s)]
*  Like, it would have to be like on the news, in my face, [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7108.72s)]
*  oh my God, we're at war. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7111.96s)]
*  That's what it'd have to be in my 20s. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7113.68s)]
*  And it wasn't until, I mean, I started reading some books [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7115.36s)]
*  that got me into like the Kennedy assassination. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7121.0s)]
*  I started reading some books that got me thinking about, [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7124.28s)]
*  like operation, like the MK Ultra shit, [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7128.64s)]
*  the things that they did with people with the LSD tests. [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7130.64s)]
*  I was like, what the fuck is our history? [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7134.12s)]
*  And I started getting into it then. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7137.16s)]
*  But when I was a young kid, when I was in my, [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7139.92s)]
*  I can't imagine these kids that are like politically active, [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7143.24s)]
*  that are like 17, 18 years old. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7146.320000000001s)]
*  Like, I didn't know jack shit about what was going on [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7148.0s)]
*  in the world in terms of politics. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7150.56s)]
*  See, I was one of those funny kids that read the newspaper [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7152.52s)]
*  and cared and then just like skip school and got high [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7155.64s)]
*  and was like, fuck this shit. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7158.240000000001s)]
*  Like I had opinions and I had hope, [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7159.280000000001s)]
*  but now like I feel the last few years, [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7161.4800000000005s)]
*  especially watching the pandemic from afar [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7164.08s)]
*  and watching everything happening, I was just like, [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7167.56s)]
*  I don't know if people are able to discern truth [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7171.0s)]
*  from fake anymore. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7175.360000000001s)]
*  No, I don't know either. [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7176.84s)]
*  And then it's really hard. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7178.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and that's where I started to lose hope [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7179.96s)]
*  because I was like, wow, things really seem clear [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7182.240000000001s)]
*  to me and a certain, you know, like it seems like [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7186.16s)]
*  pretty clear what's going on, [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7189.92s)]
*  but there's a lot of argument about things [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7191.44s)]
*  that don't feel like we're grappling [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7194.12s)]
*  with actual truth and facts. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7196.2s)]
*  And that's when I started to lose hope. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7198.48s)]
*  And I'm like, I don't know. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7201.2s)]
*  I don't know what the direction is. [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7202.48s)]
*  I think it always moves in a better direction, [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7204.16s)]
*  but it doesn't do it linearly. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7206.04s)]
*  It doesn't do it clean. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7208.24s)]
*  There's like a lot of chaos going on. [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7210.12s)]
*  It's sort of like, it's like the climate. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7212.12s)]
*  There's a lot of peaks and valleys with human growth. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7215.879999999999s)]
*  I think we're ultimately always moving [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7220.32s)]
*  towards a better place, [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7222.92s)]
*  but sometimes there's corrections that have to happen [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7223.879999999999s)]
*  and we have to figure out what we're doing. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7226.08s)]
*  And I think that as a group collectively, [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7228.5199999999995s)]
*  the biggest fear that I have is that we just get swallowed up [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7231.799999999999s)]
*  by something that we create. [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7234.759999999999s)]
*  That's the thing. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7236.96s)]
*  I mean, I feel like maybe it's inevitable. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7237.799999999999s)]
*  Maybe that's just what we're here for anyway, [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7239.5599999999995s)]
*  but I feel like that's what, oddly enough, [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7242.0s)]
*  that's what Ted Kaczynski believed. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7244.84s)]
*  That's what the fucking Unabomber believed. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7246.64s)]
*  He believed that technology was gonna kill the human race. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7248.96s)]
*  Well, it makes sense as an aspect of like, [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7252.2s)]
*  the feeling that we're our own worst enemy [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7254.6s)]
*  and I wouldn't disagree with you. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7256.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, we definitely are, right? [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7258.04s)]
*  Because if we stopped all war right now, [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7259.24s)]
*  just no one ever killed anyone ever again, [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7262.24s)]
*  just stop and everybody work together. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7265.0s)]
*  The only reason that's not possible [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7267.400000000001s)]
*  is because of world leaders. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7269.08s)]
*  If it was just individual human beings [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7270.56s)]
*  that live together in cities, [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7272.88s)]
*  there's very rarely are there intra-city wars, right? [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7274.08s)]
*  There's not even interstate wars anymore. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7278.2s)]
*  We only tried that once. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7280.48s)]
*  Most of the time, it's someone over there [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7281.72s)]
*  and someone over there. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7284.16s)]
*  Like, why? [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7285.0s)]
*  Why is that? [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7285.82s)]
*  Because of world leaders. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7286.66s)]
*  It's all because of world leaders. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7287.5s)]
*  Inequality gaps. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7288.5199999999995s)]
*  Because if there's someone who can send someone else [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7289.8s)]
*  to fight for them, it'll happen. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7292.2s)]
*  Yes, and they provide them with free college, Eddie. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7294.32s)]
*  Yeah, and then there's drone attacks. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7297.96s)]
*  I mean, the fact that you can just fucking fly robots [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7300.32s)]
*  into another country and launch missiles, like, whew. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7302.44s)]
*  All of it, it's wild. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7305.32s)]
*  It's all wild and scary, [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7306.5199999999995s)]
*  and it's all being done without, [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7308.4s)]
*  we're not there, right? [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7311.879999999999s)]
*  We don't know those people, [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7313.2s)]
*  and they're in charge of our existence. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7314.74s)]
*  They're at the forefront of the most dangerous game [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7316.719999999999s)]
*  in human existence. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7321.04s)]
*  They're the forefront of global thermonuclear war. [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7322.679999999999s)]
*  And that's the issue with everything, [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7327.719999999999s)]
*  is the idea of by proxy, right? [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7329.179999999999s)]
*  I love watching like Yakuza films, like proxy wars. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7332.76s)]
*  Everything happens. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7336.76s)]
*  War, Yakuza proxy wars. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7338.94s)]
*  It's because somebody, there's an inequality gap [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7341.44s)]
*  between two classes of people. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7345.88s)]
*  And when you have someone that has so much to gain [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7348.5199999999995s)]
*  by sending someone in, they do not give a fuck about [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7351.08s)]
*  to fight their war by proxy. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7353.6s)]
*  They're gonna do it. [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7355.44s)]
*  And like, let's take it out of war and the Yakuza [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7356.68s)]
*  so you can see it in like everyday life. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7359.28s)]
*  Restaurants, if it's the chef and he's there [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7361.62s)]
*  and he's working like I was early days at Bauhaus, [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7365.18s)]
*  that's gonna be the best version of it. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7367.38s)]
*  Now, if I take it out of there and I go teach someone [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7369.9s)]
*  who teaches someone to teach someone, [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7373.2s)]
*  inevitably, it's not gonna be as good. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7374.94s)]
*  It's not gonna be as good. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7377.7s)]
*  And like, if someone offers me that deal, [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7378.54s)]
*  I'll probably still take it if like, [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7380.68s)]
*  I feel like there's a level of quality [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7383.12s)]
*  it can maintain and stay at. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7385.54s)]
*  But the fact of the matter is, [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7387.36s)]
*  anything by proxy is gonna be shittier [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7389.46s)]
*  and there's gonna be injustice. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7392.14s)]
*  It's writing a show, all these guys, [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7393.68s)]
*  they put their names on a show, [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7395.86s)]
*  they're not actually writing it. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7396.84s)]
*  Then they have the little homie write it. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7398.3s)]
*  It's not, very rarely do you accidentally hit [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7400.34s)]
*  on a little homie who's as good or better than you. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7403.34s)]
*  Well, you occasionally do, but the point is like, [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7405.78s)]
*  it's a hustle. [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7407.74s)]
*  It's a money hustle at that point. [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7409.2s)]
*  It's not really like a passion project. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7410.82s)]
*  It's not the thing. And it's feudalism. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7412.86s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7414.16s)]
*  If we only forced the sons of millionaires to go to war, [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7416.5s)]
*  There wouldn't be any. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7423.66s)]
*  It was done, if they did it that way, [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7424.5s)]
*  if they did it by income, [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7427.38s)]
*  and the wealthiest people's sons [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7428.98s)]
*  were the first to get drafted overseas. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7430.78s)]
*  Do you imagine how quickly they'd stop war? [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7433.1s)]
*  They'd be like, what the fuck are you up to? [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7435.54s)]
*  But that makes sense. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7436.9s)]
*  What's going on, you gonna kill my Billy? [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7437.74s)]
*  Because they have the most to gain. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7438.94s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7440.42s)]
*  So why shouldn't they risk the most? [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7441.26s)]
*  But it's just crazy that these systems [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7443.2s)]
*  have always sort of existed. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7446.48s)]
*  These systems and classes of people, [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7448.0s)]
*  people that were willing to send people to war, [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7452.16s)]
*  and then people that are never going to war on their own. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7455.86s)]
*  They're like, I'm not going, but they'll send people, [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7457.639999999999s)]
*  and they make decisions, and they do it behind desks. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7460.099999999999s)]
*  They do it in offices, and it's always existed like that. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7462.72s)]
*  It's fucking wild. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7465.9s)]
*  And there's no consequences to their decisions. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7467.24s)]
*  They don't give it the proper care, [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7469.84s)]
*  because that blood is never gonna splash onto their desk. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7471.32s)]
*  That's wild. [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7474.04s)]
*  By proxy is the issue, and democracy is by proxy. [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7475.84s)]
*  We need the aliens. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7483.36s)]
*  We need the aliens. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7485.08s)]
*  We need them to come down. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7485.92s)]
*  We need the aliens. [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7486.759999999999s)]
*  They have to come down, and they have to just go, [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7487.599999999999s)]
*  listen, you guys are just fucked. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7488.679999999999s)]
*  You're not gonna sort this out, stop. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7491.24s)]
*  We need someone from another planet to come [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7494.219999999999s)]
*  and be like, this is the truth, stop denying it, [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7496.48s)]
*  don't talk your way around this. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7498.58s)]
*  What do you think would happen? [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7499.42s)]
*  Imagine if Russia moves nukes into Belarus, right, [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7501.52s)]
*  which is supposedly happening, [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7506.64s)]
*  and then one day there's some sort of a critical exchange, [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7508.84s)]
*  and they go, that's it, that's enough. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7514.28s)]
*  And they just, woo, a giant ship [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7516.94s)]
*  hovering over the battlefield, [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7522.64s)]
*  where everybody's like, holy fuck. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7524.7s)]
*  And you realize that this thing is from another planet. [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7528.42s)]
*  It sends out a bunch of satellite ships, [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7530.56s)]
*  and they come down, and these things get out. [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7533.6s)]
*  It's not far from reality. [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7536.92s)]
*  Would you do it that way if you were an alien, [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7539.6s)]
*  or would you force these dummies [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7541.280000000001s)]
*  to create artificial intelligence [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7543.160000000001s)]
*  that eventually takes them over? [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7544.68s)]
*  Would you conquer them that way? [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7546.240000000001s)]
*  If you looked at these, like imagine, [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7547.8s)]
*  I just wanna think about it this way. [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7550.64s)]
*  Imagine if we went to some sort of a jungle, [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7552.0s)]
*  and someone had given the chimpanzees missiles, [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7557.16s)]
*  and the chimpanzees just fuckin' launching missiles. [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7561.72s)]
*  We'd be like, yo, we gotta kill those chimpanzees. [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7564.56s)]
*  They're fuckin' shootin' at planes, [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7566.84s)]
*  they're shootin' at boats, we gotta kill them. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7568.6s)]
*  Right, they're too wild. [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7570.88s)]
*  They would come in and kill them, right? [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7572.12s)]
*  I bet they would do that with us. [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7574.92s)]
*  If we were a threat, they would absolutely kill us. [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7576.16s)]
*  And the fact that they haven't killed us means we're clowns. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7578.8s)]
*  I think they could stop that. [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7581.88s)]
*  We're absolute clowns. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7582.72s)]
*  My brother's feeling is, and he's smarter than me, [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7584.400000000001s)]
*  and he reads much more alien stuff, [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7587.12s)]
*  I was like, yo, if they're here, why haven't they killed us? [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7589.360000000001s)]
*  He goes, they don't care. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7591.72s)]
*  He's like, I think they're doing research. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7593.76s)]
*  And I'm like, all right, if they're doing research, [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7595.56s)]
*  then they're just gonna let us die. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7597.28s)]
*  And they're probably watching us on screens just laughing. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7599.24s)]
*  Like, yo, look at these idiots, look at these idiots. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7603.68s)]
*  I would imagine we're pretty funny to watch. [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7606.2s)]
*  They can't even drink water in Philadelphia. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7607.84s)]
*  Yeah, I know, right? [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7610.400000000001s)]
*  It's like Housewives for them. [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7612.16s)]
*  Like, yo, check out Housewives Philadelphia. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7613.84s)]
*  They don't got water now. [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7616.0s)]
*  You should have seen what happened in East Palestine. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7618.32s)]
*  The aliens are watching us, like, bravo. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7620.68s)]
*  Probably. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7624.44s)]
*  I bet they're probably monitoring nuclear sites. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7626.28s)]
*  Because one of the things that has been reported in the past, [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7629.8s)]
*  and again, you don't know if it's true or not. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7633.2s)]
*  You don't know if you're getting, [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7635.16s)]
*  this brings us back to what we were originally talking about. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7636.24s)]
*  You don't know if you're getting bullshitted. [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7638.96s)]
*  You don't know if it really happened. [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7640.8s)]
*  You don't know, if you weren't there, [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7642.400000000001s)]
*  and they don't have any physical evidence for you to watch [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7644.4400000000005s)]
*  or see or touch, even physical evidence you can watch, [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7646.52s)]
*  we know that could be horseshit. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7649.08s)]
*  But most likely it's not, if it comes from official channels. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7650.68s)]
*  But like, it doesn't mean they don't exist. [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7653.88s)]
*  Like, even if some of you think that it's nonsense, [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7657.08s)]
*  you think it's silly, that might be part of the plan. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7659.320000000001s)]
*  Part of the plan might be, make it seem silly. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7661.4800000000005s)]
*  That way, you could just be around all the time. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7664.96s)]
*  And people talk about it, [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7668.04s)]
*  and even the Pentagon talks about it. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7669.28s)]
*  Like, no one cares? [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7671.56s)]
*  Like, well, okay, you hit the right frequency then. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7672.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and that means they're [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7674.16s)]
*  a much more evolved civilization than us. [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7676.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they're playing a lot of games. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7678.52s)]
*  Yeah, they're also, they recognize that we, [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7680.6s)]
*  we have a real susceptibility to groupthink. [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7684.04s)]
*  And we're real susceptibility, [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7687.64s)]
*  and if you can trick people into thinking [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7689.0s)]
*  that UFOs are silly, oh God, what are you thinking about? [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7691.16s)]
*  Other life forms from another planet, so silly. [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7693.96s)]
*  What a great way to trick people. [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7696.6s)]
*  If you could do that, and you did exist, [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7698.92s)]
*  you could make it so that talking about you [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7701.28s)]
*  carries a social consequence. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7703.68s)]
*  So if you're in polite society, right, now, [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7705.96s)]
*  nowadays in 2023, you can have a conversation about UFOs, [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7709.24s)]
*  because the New York Times wrote an article about it. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7712.4800000000005s)]
*  You could say, did you see that? [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7714.8s)]
*  Did you see that article in the New York Times? [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7715.64s)]
*  Did you see the Pentagon had a discussion? [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7717.08s)]
*  So, yo, what if Woody Allen is an alien? [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7719.24s)]
*  Because no one writes faster than this guy. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7722.04s)]
*  Nobody, he's made so many good films. [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7724.56s)]
*  He's done terrible things, and he survives, [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7726.72s)]
*  and he's among us, and it's just like, [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7729.08s)]
*  is Woody Allen an alien? [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7730.88s)]
*  Like, how did he figure out? [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7732.12s)]
*  That might be the worst take I've ever heard from you. [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7733.4400000000005s)]
*  Bro, but what if the exact tone, like, it's like, [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7734.92s)]
*  look at the things he's accused of doing, [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7737.72s)]
*  and he walks among us. [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7740.240000000001s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7742.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7744.04s)]
*  Like, he's uncancelable. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7744.88s)]
*  Well, not really, because I don't know [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7747.04s)]
*  if actors are as willing to work with him anymore, [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7749.84s)]
*  and I don't know, like, what kind of distribution, [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7753.400000000001s)]
*  how has that affected his films, [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7757.16s)]
*  and what he does, and what he's allowed to do? [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7759.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7761.04s)]
*  Like, his own family's come out against him, [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7761.86s)]
*  and he's still out here. [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7764.04s)]
*  Like, even Bill Cosby had to go to court, at least. [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7766.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7769.4s)]
*  You know? [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7770.24s)]
*  At least. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7771.08s)]
*  And he's still out, he came back outside, like. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7771.919999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7773.839999999999s)]
*  It's dark. [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7776.48s)]
*  Yeah, Woody Allen as an alien is dark. [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7777.679999999999s)]
*  Well, I don't think he's an alien. [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7780.9s)]
*  I think he's just a flawed human being. [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7782.12s)]
*  But the idea, what I guess I'm saying [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7784.88s)]
*  is the concept that you're saying is they're among us, [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7786.84s)]
*  and they've made themselves a laughing stock in a joke [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7789.400000000001s)]
*  so as to avert an invasion. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7792.4800000000005s)]
*  I don't even know if, necessarily, they're among us. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7793.68s)]
*  I don't know if the things that people are seeing, [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7796.56s)]
*  I don't know, I think those are probably, [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7798.88s)]
*  I'm just guessing, I shouldn't even say probably, [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7801.24s)]
*  but I think those could be drones. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7803.72s)]
*  I think they could be super sophisticated drones [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7806.0s)]
*  that we don't understand, [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7808.86s)]
*  because they've done all of this science [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7810.72s)]
*  in a way where they never made it public. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7814.12s)]
*  That's not, [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7817.0s)]
*  it's not likely, but it is possible. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7820.240000000001s)]
*  It's one of those things where you're like, [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7824.52s)]
*  man, you don't know. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7825.52s)]
*  Like, if they were very clever [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7826.76s)]
*  and they started doing this at a certain point [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7827.92s)]
*  in time and history, and they were almost like a movie, [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7829.6s)]
*  where they had this secret laboratory [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7832.16s)]
*  where they hired the top physicists [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7834.52s)]
*  and they gave them some fake jobs, [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7836.360000000001s)]
*  like, oh, I'm in charge of fertilizer reproduction [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7837.8s)]
*  and this chemical plant bullshit, [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7841.12s)]
*  this guy is, he's over there back engineering UFOs. [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7842.92s)]
*  You know, like, what if they really do have some crash shit [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7845.96s)]
*  that they found in Roswell, New Mexico in 1947 [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7851.08s)]
*  and they've been trying to figure out [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7853.92s)]
*  how to back engineer that, and they're getting closer. [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7854.92s)]
*  Dude, I just wanna meet Optimus Prime. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7857.32s)]
*  Like, Optimus Prime looks like the illest alien. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7859.44s)]
*  Like, I just hope that it's Optimus Prime. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7862.16s)]
*  That would be fucking sick. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7864.5199999999995s)]
*  I want a little tiny gray dude that could read minds. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7865.5599999999995s)]
*  I want the traditional, I want the bullshit [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7868.04s)]
*  and new age fucking robot. [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7871.12s)]
*  I want a truck. [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7872.92s)]
*  I don't want a truck. [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7873.76s)]
*  Sam Wickwitty. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7874.599999999999s)]
*  Ah! [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7876.0s)]
*  What if it was like Woody from Toy Story? [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7878.2s)]
*  What if that's who the aliens are? [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7880.48s)]
*  They come down here, they're like, what the fuck, Woody? [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7881.76s)]
*  Woody, you're the head alien? [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7884.679999999999s)]
*  But that's like that scene in Contact. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7886.96s)]
*  Remember in that Jodie Foster movie? [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7888.88s)]
*  Did you ever see Contact? [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7890.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, long time ago. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7891.4s)]
*  When the end of the movie, I believe it's her day, [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7892.5599999999995s)]
*  comes to her as her dad, I think the alien tells her, [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7894.96s)]
*  I'm pretty sure it's her dad, [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7899.16s)]
*  and it tells her, like they're walking together, [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7900.56s)]
*  it's like this whatever we are is too much for you to handle, [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7903.400000000001s)]
*  so I've shown myself in this form. [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7908.04s)]
*  Yeah, it's a heavy scene, dude. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7910.76s)]
*  It's a heavy scene. [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7914.56s)]
*  It's a really good movie, man. [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7916.56s)]
*  Do you remember that movie? [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7918.12s)]
*  Yo, I do, I haven't seen it in a while. [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7919.68s)]
*  It was written by, the original novel was by Carl Sagan, [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7922.16s)]
*  and they converted it into one of the best [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7926.8s)]
*  like alien movies of all time, [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7931.320000000001s)]
*  because it was like an intellectual dramatic movie [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7933.84s)]
*  about contact with an alien race, [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7938.400000000001s)]
*  and how it was probably gonna present itself, [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7941.0s)]
*  and it was very, very novel, [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7943.4400000000005s)]
*  because Carl Sagan was fucking brilliant. [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7945.16s)]
*  Also, huge pothead, Carl Sagan, huge pothead. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7947.4800000000005s)]
*  And the movies be predicting the reality, like. [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7952.12s)]
*  That one is probably. [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7955.24s)]
*  I gotta watch this. [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7956.48s)]
*  It's probably how they would do it. [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7957.84s)]
*  If they were gonna make contact with you, [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7959.5199999999995s)]
*  why would they freak you out, [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7960.76s)]
*  and come looking like some fucking weird stick figure [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7961.679999999999s)]

*  But that was her dad, right? [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7966.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7967.599999999999s)]
*  Woody Allen. [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7968.44s)]
*  Ah, motherfucker, you don't wanna let it go. [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7969.28s)]
*  Why you so hanging on to this? [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7972.639999999999s)]
*  Why you hanging on to this, Eddie? [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7974.5599999999995s)]

*  I love hanging on to the ridiculous point. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7982.4s)]
*  Maybe that's right, though. [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7984.16s)]
*  But let's look at it this way. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7985.4s)]
*  What a better way to hide yourself. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7987.68s)]
*  No one's coming to him for wisdom. [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7990.0s)]
*  No one's coming to him to think how to run the world. [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7991.76s)]
*  But what if he's amongst us, [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7994.5599999999995s)]
*  just making these silly movies, [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7995.5599999999995s)]
*  but really just gathering data? [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7997.84s)]
*  Yeah, and giving us the deepest insights [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=7999.5599999999995s)]
*  into our souls for these films. [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8001.76s)]
*  And you know why I really like Woody Allen as an alien? [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8003.48s)]
*  Because I do feel if the aliens came, [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8006.16s)]
*  they would be fucking Knicks fans. [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8008.0s)]
*  That's why. [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8009.5599999999995s)]

*  If you say so. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8016.780000000001s)]

*  So they were, it's real similar. [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8227.34s)]
*  So they were tripping balls. [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8228.78s)]
*  So this is where they invented all these things. [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8230.54s)]
*  This is where they have the Lucinian mysteries. [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8232.62s)]
*  Like all these different people from all over the world [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8235.580000000002s)]
*  would come to have these experiences with these people [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8239.1s)]
*  and drink this wine. [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8241.980000000001s)]
*  And that's what they were doing. [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8242.980000000001s)]
*  They're tripping balls. [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8243.82s)]
*  And that's how they invented everything. [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8245.34s)]
*  That's how they invented democracies. [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8246.62s)]
*  They invented so many aspects of society. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8248.380000000001s)]
*  And so many philosophers were a part of that [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8250.94s)]
*  that made quotes that we still use today. [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8257.1s)]
*  Yeah, the foundation of our language, [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8259.78s)]
*  the foundation of Western thought is all, it's all Greek. [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8261.9s)]
*  Foundation of democracy. [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8265.26s)]
*  It's really wild. [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8266.78s)]
*  They did all that while they were most likely high [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8267.7s)]
*  on some sort of a psychedelic. [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8272.1s)]
*  And Brian Murrow, rescue in this book, [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8274.300000000001s)]
*  makes the case so convincingly and academically [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8277.460000000001s)]
*  that Harvard opened up like a field of study [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8281.380000000001s)]
*  in looking into ancient Greece and psychedelic drugs. [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8284.5s)]
*  And so this whole, this whole you Lucinian mystery thing, [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8288.66s)]
*  this like Lucinian school that they would, [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8291.54s)]
*  all that was like these people were most likely [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8293.86s)]
*  at least some time while they were there tripping balls. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8296.660000000002s)]
*  See, for me, when I was in high school, [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8300.34s)]
*  I was really interested in reading [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8302.300000000001s)]
*  about fifth century philosophy and thought, [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8304.54s)]
*  because in the fifth century, you get Plato, [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8307.26s)]
*  Aristotle, Socrates, Lao Tzu, Buddha, [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8309.380000000001s)]
*  all of those things. [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8314.5s)]
*  And when you compare them, at the end, [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8315.54s)]
*  there is, everyone in those civilizations [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8318.820000000002s)]
*  tends to agree on the idea of order and balance. [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8321.78s)]
*  Like yin and yang, that there's two sides to everything. [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8325.539999999999s)]
*  And that is the foundation of my value system [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8328.66s)]
*  because I'm like, yo, that was interesting. [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8331.539999999999s)]
*  That was a century where people called a spade a spade [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8333.14s)]
*  and was like, you have to stay even and balanced. [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8336.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8339.34s)]
*  There's two sides to everything. [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8340.18s)]
*  And when you compare the philosophy, [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8342.86s)]
*  when you do a comparative look at the philosophies, [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8346.18s)]
*  they do come to some similar conclusions [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8349.02s)]
*  from a macro perspective. [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8351.22s)]
*  Yeah, I think most human beings, [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8352.740000000002s)]
*  when intelligent human beings get together [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8355.220000000001s)]
*  to debate ideas over a long period of time, [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8357.42s)]
*  as long as they're entering into this thing, [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8360.220000000001s)]
*  not with the desire to formulate propaganda, [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8362.740000000002s)]
*  but to actually get to the truth, [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8366.220000000001s)]
*  they come to similar conclusions. [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8367.86s)]
*  Yeah, if you eliminate ego and the desire to win, [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8370.060000000001s)]
*  take that out, you have similar. [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8374.300000000001s)]
*  And that's, with society, it would be really cool [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8376.02s)]
*  if we took out the desire to win [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8379.220000000001s)]
*  because I think that's just, you can't. [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8381.06s)]
*  It's fucking us up. [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8383.66s)]
*  Yeah, it's always gonna fuck you up. [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8384.66s)]
*  I think it's because of what we talked about before, [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8386.58s)]
*  that every person should have something that they're doing [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8388.619999999999s)]
*  that's difficult to do. [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8391.98s)]
*  Because if you don't have something that you're doing [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8393.46s)]
*  that's difficult to do, [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8394.859999999999s)]
*  you try to look for competition in everything. [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8395.699999999999s)]
*  Try to look for competition socially with your neighbors. [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8398.3s)]
*  You try to look for competition with this bitch. [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8400.539999999999s)]
*  Everybody's got a thing they're doing. [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8404.46s)]
*  It gets in the way. [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8406.14s)]
*  If you do something where you compete against yourself [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8409.38s)]
*  in your own will, I think it quenches that. [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8412.5s)]
*  Yeah, and you were saying the people that are like, [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8414.939999999999s)]
*  fuck yeah, America's the best, they're holding us back. [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8417.82s)]
*  It's pride. [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8420.699999999999s)]
*  Every country feeds you pride as a drug. [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8421.9s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8425.019999999999s)]
*  Because then they can manipulate you [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8426.099999999999s)]
*  if you have collective pride. [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8427.98s)]
*  And also, America's the fucking best. [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8429.619999999999s)]
*  So you can suck it, everybody can suck it. [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8431.42s)]
*  See, it's fun to say. [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8434.42s)]
*  That's part of the problem. [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8435.779999999999s)]
*  It is fun to say. [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8437.099999999999s)]
*  That's fun to say. [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8438.580000000002s)]
*  America's the best, you can suck it. [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8439.42s)]
*  We're the dumbest for sure. [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8441.460000000001s)]
*  We're also the smartest. [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8443.18s)]
*  I say one China just because it sounds funny. [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8445.26s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8447.7s)]
*  One China. One China. [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8448.660000000002s)]
*  There's guys that play, it's interesting. [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8450.460000000001s)]
*  There's these guys that play pool out of Taiwan. [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8452.380000000001s)]
*  But I think they have to write Chinese Taipei. [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8455.5s)]
*  I think it's one of those deals, right? [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8458.62s)]
*  And the Ko brothers, [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8460.18s)]
*  they're two of the best pool players in the world [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8462.060000000001s)]
*  come out of Taiwan. [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8464.02s)]
*  Yeah, it's Koping Chung and... [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8465.380000000001s)]
*  What's his brother's name? [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8469.3s)]
*  Koping... [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8470.26s)]
*  Koping Chung and Koping Yi? [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8473.7s)]
*  Yeah, Koping Yi and Koping Chung. [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8476.02s)]
*  So Koping Yi and Koping Chung. [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8478.86s)]
*  They're two of the best pool players on earth. [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8480.78s)]
*  And they come out of Taiwan. [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8483.18s)]
*  And they were kind of secluded from the pool scene [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8484.26s)]
*  for a couple of years because of COVID. [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8487.1s)]
*  Because everything got very strict with COVID and travel. [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8489.02s)]
*  But I'm pretty sure they have to write Chinese Taipei [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8492.060000000001s)]
*  on their shirts, right? [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8495.54s)]
*  So does it say that on like, [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8496.62s)]
*  if you have a passport and you pass through, [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8497.78s)]
*  do they mark it as Taiwan? [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8500.74s)]
*  Or do they mark it as Chinese Taipei? [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8502.18s)]
*  So if I fly with a Taiwanese passport, it says Taiwan. [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8503.78s)]
*  It does say Taiwan. [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8507.74s)]
*  But that's the thing, it's the agreement. [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8508.7s)]
*  It's like an in the house agreement. [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8510.82s)]
*  You're your own country, [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8512.58s)]
*  but when you talk to white people, say our name first. [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8513.9s)]
*  Like call me daddy. [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8516.7s)]
*  It's all pride. [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8518.82s)]
*  It's all fucking crazy. [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8520.380000000001s)]
*  That's a hilarious take. [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8522.18s)]
*  Do you think that China will ever invade Taiwan? [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8523.9s)]
*  Is that a fear? [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8527.66s)]
*  Like when you're thinking about like Russia invading Ukraine, [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8528.5s)]
*  do you think that could ever take place [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8532.86s)]
*  where China invades Taiwan? [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8534.18s)]
*  Okay. [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8535.66s)]
*  Who's the woman in Florida that killed her own kid? [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8537.82s)]
*  What? [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8540.9s)]
*  Some, huh? [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8541.74s)]
*  Yeah, Casey Anthony. [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8542.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8543.74s)]
*  If you have a Casey Anthony leader in China, [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8545.18s)]
*  potentially in the future, yeah. [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8547.82s)]
*  Not this guy. [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8551.18s)]
*  This guy's not, [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8552.02s)]
*  he doesn't wanna kill Chinese Taiwanese people. [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8552.86s)]
*  That's the thing is that after 1950, [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8557.86s)]
*  so much of that country is Chinese people [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8561.380000000001s)]
*  that lost a civil war led by Chiang Kai-shek into Taiwan. [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8565.66s)]
*  The question would be akin to like, [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8569.58s)]
*  would we ever like attack the South? [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8572.42s)]
*  You know? [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8575.380000000001s)]
*  Hmm, interesting. [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8576.22s)]
*  I just don't think China has it in its heart to like do it. [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8577.98s)]
*  And I really do think Taiwan is used as just, [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8584.82s)]
*  this is like a sore spot. [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8589.58s)]
*  So do you think it's used to like, [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8591.34s)]
*  the West uses it to try to make China look bad in some way, [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8595.1s)]
*  or to try to show that there's some sort of a conflict [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8599.18s)]
*  between Taiwan and China and that we side with Taiwan? [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8602.02s)]
*  Is it like a political ploy? [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8605.02s)]
*  I really do think America and the other Western forces [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8606.98s)]
*  use Taiwan as like an X. [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8611.98s)]
*  Like you hold it up and you're like, [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8613.939999999999s)]
*  hey, I just went out with her. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8615.26s)]
*  Oh no. [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8618.5s)]
*  It's like Kim Kardashian with Pete Davidson. [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8619.34s)]
*  Oh no. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8623.14s)]
*  Taiwan's Pete Davidson. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8623.98s)]
*  Ah! [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8625.06s)]
*  You know? [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8625.9s)]
*  Ah! [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8626.74s)]
*  That's hilarious. [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8629.699999999999s)]
*  That's a hilarious comparison, [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8630.939999999999s)]
*  but I see what you're saying. [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8632.06s)]
*  And Kanye got all crazy and mad. [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8632.9s)]
*  China gets mad, you're making us look bad. [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8635.82s)]
*  I get it. [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8638.42s)]
*  Yep. [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8639.26s)]
*  But I don't think they're actually gonna do it. [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8640.1s)]
*  It's just a lot of mumbo jumbo. [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8642.060000000001s)]
*  You know what's interesting? [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8644.26s)]
*  And people make money off it. [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8645.1s)]
*  They do make money off it. [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8645.92s)]
*  One of the things that's interesting is that, [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8647.380000000001s)]
*  one of the things that people are worried about [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8649.220000000001s)]
*  is China invading X, China taking over the world. [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8652.1s)]
*  But then if you ask them like, [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8656.02s)]
*  when has China ever invaded anybody? [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8657.98s)]
*  Like it's only been really too bad, right? [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8660.460000000001s)]
*  Not since the wall. [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8662.62s)]
*  Like straight up, [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8664.5s)]
*  like the imperialistic intentions ended since the wall. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8665.34s)]
*  And if it's the calling the kettle black, [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8669.7s)]
*  America's the one that'll go into other countries. [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8672.98s)]
*  China do business with you. [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8675.58s)]
*  Like America will come rape and pillage, [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8678.66s)]
*  China will hire you as an escort. [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8680.52s)]
*  Right. [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8682.460000000001s)]
*  Well China has so many mineral areas, [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8684.26s)]
*  like so many mineral rights, [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8688.82s)]
*  and they have mines in the Congo, [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8690.220000000001s)]
*  where they're pulling out cobalt. [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8691.9s)]
*  They're controlling very valuable natural resources. [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8693.34s)]
*  The whole thing has been very clever [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8698.14s)]
*  because they exist in a completely controlled system. [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8699.4s)]
*  They have control over their system. [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8703.66s)]
*  They have control over their people. [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8705.06s)]
*  And that's why this country is kind of at a disadvantage. [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8707.099999999999s)]
*  We let them buy real estate, [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8709.9s)]
*  and they're like, yeah, go ahead, buy that building. [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8710.98s)]
*  They're buying all the great buildings. [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8712.539999999999s)]
*  It's gonna be literal China. [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8714.22s)]
*  They'll own it all, [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8715.98s)]
*  or Saudi Arabia or somebody else will own it. [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8716.82s)]
*  And like, okay. [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8719.26s)]
*  Meanwhile, how much can you buy? [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8720.5s)]
*  If you're an American business, [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8722.3s)]
*  can you go over and buy giant skyscrapers in China? [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8723.939999999999s)]
*  Can you start running them? [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8726.199999999999s)]
*  You have to do a lot of money laundering and da da da da. [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8727.98s)]
*  But yeah, like I could probably give you a guy. [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8731.5s)]
*  Yeah, but it's very difficult. [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8733.619999999999s)]
*  It's very difficult. [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8735.22s)]
*  America just has this identity crisis [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8736.74s)]
*  because we've told all the immigrants [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8738.859999999999s)]
*  we're this benevolent, colossus, this place. [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8740.38s)]
*  Come, we're the world's fucking super police. [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8743.619999999999s)]
*  We're the cops, we take care of everyone. [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8747.22s)]
*  When it's like, yeah, we're a business. [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8749.179999999998s)]
*  Just like, just do what's good for it. [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8750.82s)]
*  And if you start to look at it that way, [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8754.3s)]
*  decisions become much easier. [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8756.34s)]
*  But right now, it's a country that serves too many masters [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8759.119999999999s)]
*  internally within itself [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8763.58s)]
*  because you're serving business, but you won't admit it. [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8764.94s)]
*  And that's where I think the identity crisis is. [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8768.38s)]
*  You're serving business, you won't admit it. [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8769.22s)]
*  And also, what is a border? [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8770.5s)]
*  Like, what are we doing? [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8774.699999999999s)]
*  Are you allowed to come in if you sneak in, [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8776.02s)]
*  or do we have to turn you back? [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8778.1s)]
*  Do you, is it okay if it comes from the north, [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8779.9s)]
*  but not okay from the south? [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8782.58s)]
*  What about from the sides? [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8783.779999999999s)]
*  At what point in time do we decide [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8786.779999999999s)]
*  that you can't take more people? [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8789.8s)]
*  Or at what point in time do we decide [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8791.14s)]
*  to let all the walls drop [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8792.46s)]
*  and everybody go wherever the fuck they want, [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8793.9s)]
*  everywhere, let's even the whole world out? [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8795.4s)]
*  That's the scary one. [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8797.66s)]
*  That's the scary one. [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8798.98s)]
*  Anybody can go anywhere, shut the fuck up, [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8800.3s)]
*  and then you're gonna have madness until it settles down. [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8803.14s)]
*  So like many generations. [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8805.94s)]
*  We don't wanna rip the band-aid off. [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8807.44s)]
*  We wanna go like just like eh, eh, eh. [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8809.1s)]
*  We don't wanna woo, let's open it all up. [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8812.300000000001s)]
*  Yeah, opening it all up would be a real issue [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8815.66s)]
*  for a little bit, but I think in the long run, [[02:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8818.380000000001s)]
*  if everything was open, if everybody could go everywhere, [[02:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8821.720000000001s)]
*  probably be better for human beings. [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8825.140000000001s)]
*  The only problem is some spots are better. [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8829.02s)]
*  Yeah, some spots are better, and here's the thing. [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8831.16s)]
*  I would be interested in opening it all up [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8833.36s)]
*  because I'm interested in like the seeking of truth. [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8835.52s)]
*  Global mobility would be amazing. [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8838.56s)]
*  You would lose some, you would lose local culture. [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8840.34s)]
*  Certain things would become extinct. [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8843.56s)]
*  You would lose the idea of federalism, [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8845.519999999999s)]
*  but if we look at the UFC, [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8847.34s)]
*  you would come to some agreements and truths. [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8849.84s)]
*  It would be like a UFC of life. [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8852.279999999999s)]
*  Yeah, because what's the UFC? [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8854.68s)]
*  It would probably take as long too. [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8856.48s)]
*  Probably take about 20 years to really figure it out [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8857.8s)]
*  until you get like a elite, high level, [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8860.359999999999s)]
*  modern 2023 champion. [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8863.84s)]
*  Because the UFC is literally enter the dragon [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8865.4s)]
*  when it first started. [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8867.72s)]
*  Everyone from every country, bring your martial arts, [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8868.56s)]
*  try it out. [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8871.0s)]
*  I like what you're saying. [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8871.84s)]
*  It's so crazy, but I think it makes sense. [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8873.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8875.84s)]
*  Because like the best way to live would work out. [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8876.679999999998s)]
*  But the problem is if we don't have [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8879.72s)]
*  like a real clear set of rules, [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8880.96s)]
*  if you just open up the borders [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8883.519999999999s)]
*  and people are just gonna like take over everything. [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8885.119999999999s)]
*  People storm through cities [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8888.199999999999s)]
*  and do whatever the fuck they want, [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8890.519999999999s)]
*  and there's no cops anyway. [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8891.88s)]
*  What are you gonna do? [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8893.08s)]
*  Yeah, everything makes sense if you look at it [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8893.92s)]
*  through the prism of sports. [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8896.28s)]
*  It's just like you need rules for truth [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8897.800000000001s)]
*  to shake out half dev rules. [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8900.720000000001s)]
*  Cause then you define winning, you define meritocracy. [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8902.320000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8905.320000000002s)]
*  It's like, you know, I would always say this, [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8906.16s)]
*  salary caps create, if you're gonna believe in competition, [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8909.880000000001s)]
*  if we're gonna assume the idea that competition [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8913.92s)]
*  is the best thing for the global capitalism [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8917.52s)]
*  and we have to maintain it in its purest sense, [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8920.16s)]
*  then you need salary cap. [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8922.480000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8923.960000000001s)]
*  A salary cap for everything in life? [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8927.28s)]
*  The idea of a cap where it's like [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8931.76s)]
*  you have to continue competing, sending you back. [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8933.720000000001s)]
*  Like boxing, right? [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8936.12s)]
*  If I compare boxing to UFC, [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8938.04s)]
*  the issue with boxing is you don't have to fight fights. [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8939.560000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8942.08s)]
*  You don't have to fight fights? [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8942.92s)]
*  You don't have to fight the big fights. [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8944.84s)]
*  You know, like people duck. [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8946.36s)]
*  They duck so many fights. [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8947.68s)]
*  UFC is, while it's not a salary cap, [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8949.16s)]
*  what the UFC does is it reinforces competition. [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8952.16s)]
*  You have to continue defending your belt [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8956.64s)]
*  and that's what makes it a better sport. [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8958.28s)]
*  Okay, I see what you're saying. [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8959.72s)]
*  I gotta piss so bad. [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8960.56s)]
*  Sorry. [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8961.4s)]
*  I can barely pay attention. [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8962.24s)]
*  I can't believe you fucking lasted. [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8963.08s)]
*  We'll be right back in a moment. [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8964.76s)]
*  I must piss. [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8966.36s)]
*  And we're back. [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8967.2s)]
*  I think one of the things that was very interesting [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8968.52s)]
*  that you were saying about like that life, [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8970.4s)]
*  if everything just opened up, [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8974.76s)]
*  would kind of be like the UFC. [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8975.88s)]
*  We would figure out the right way to do it. [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8977.48s)]
*  There'd be a lot of chaos. [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8979.4s)]
*  With the right rules and with the right incentive. [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8980.6s)]
*  Because you know, UFC, everybody stays poor [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8983.08s)]
*  and they keep fighting. [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8985.52s)]
*  Right? [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8987.88s)]
*  I mean, not everybody, but. [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8988.72s)]
*  What is the incentive though? [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8989.56s)]
*  Because some guys, they have, [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8990.48s)]
*  like BJ Penn in his prime, [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8992.16s)]
*  famously came from a rich family. [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8993.72s)]
*  Like BJ Penn was a weird case [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8996.039999999999s)]
*  where he just like had a warrior in his jeans. [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=8997.92s)]
*  You know, he wasn't poor. [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9000.6s)]
*  And he was one of the baddest motherfuckers of all time. [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9002.32s)]
*  Yeah, but I mean, he's not getting rewarded [[02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9004.76s)]
*  with that much money by fighting. [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9007.48s)]
*  I think what's cool about the UFC [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9009.32s)]
*  is these dudes wanna do it. [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9011.32s)]
*  Like, I get it that like say, [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9013.56s)]
*  for Chito Vera, right? [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9016.12s)]
*  Chito Vera, this is a way to become quote unquote, [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9016.960000000001s)]
*  like rich. [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9019.52s)]
*  But if you look at what Chito Vera makes in comparison [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9020.720000000001s)]
*  to like Tank or Ryan Garcia, [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9023.2s)]
*  it's not nearly as much, [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9026.04s)]
*  but you're getting better competition in the UFC, [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9028.320000000002s)]
*  I think is what I'm trying to say. [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9030.480000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9032.24s)]
*  If that makes sense. [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9033.08s)]
*  If you get to, but you ought to say, [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9033.92s)]
*  Tank and Ryan Garcia are world champions. [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9035.16s)]
*  So the difference is, [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9037.52s)]
*  if you get to world championship, [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9038.560000000001s)]
*  like Al Jameen Sterling level, [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9039.84s)]
*  Al Jameen's making, I don't know what, [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9041.52s)]
*  I shouldn't speak for him. [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9043.52s)]
*  But I know that there are many UFC champions [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9045.92s)]
*  that make millions of dollars. [[02:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9048.48s)]
*  They become very wealthy. [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9049.8s)]
*  Would you say though, [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9051.16s)]
*  that you have to work harder for your money in UFC [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9052.0s)]
*  than in boxing? [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9054.56s)]
*  I think it's a harder sport. [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9055.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9056.24s)]
*  It's not that boxing is not a hard sport. [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9057.08s)]
*  It's a very, very, very hard sport. [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9060.039999999999s)]
*  What's harder about MMA is that because of all the grappling [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9062.44s)]
*  and all the wrestling that you have to do, [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9067.2s)]
*  your body gets so beat up, [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9069.0s)]
*  it's really hard to show up on fight night [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9070.76s)]
*  and not be already damaged. [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9073.8s)]
*  Whereas in boxing, if you have good sparring partners, [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9075.48s)]
*  like the boxing fights that get canceled versus UFC, [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9078.16s)]
*  the fights that get canceled, [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9082.119999999999s)]
*  I would like to see like what the actual statistics are, [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9083.119999999999s)]
*  but I would assume there's way more UFC fights get canceled [[02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9086.119999999999s)]
*  because of the variables, the leg kicks, take downs, [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9089.4s)]
*  all those opportunities to tweak your knee [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9092.56s)]
*  or fuck your neck up. [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9094.72s)]
*  There's just so many people getting hurt in camp [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9096.56s)]
*  that never make it to the fight. [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9099.359999999999s)]
*  Whereas in boxing, it's pretty rare. [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9100.64s)]
*  Yeah, it's more rare. [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9103.0s)]
*  It's more like, oh, I broke my hand [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9104.599999999999s)]
*  on a sparring partner's head, things like that. [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9106.4s)]
*  UFC too, though, it's the idea [[02:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9109.679999999998s)]
*  that you just keep making people fight the toughest fights [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9111.96s)]
*  and then you're gonna get the true champion [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9115.64s)]
*  and you're gonna get the better sport. [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9117.519999999999s)]
*  And I think when applied to society, [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9119.64s)]
*  it's like, yo, you gotta maintain competition [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9121.48s)]
*  in a true sense. [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9124.439999999999s)]
*  Did you see Caleb Plant, David Benavides? [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9125.64s)]
*  I did not watch that fight. [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9129.4s)]
*  Dude. [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9130.72s)]
*  It was Saturday. [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9131.759999999998s)]
*  You need to see that fight. [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9133.24s)]
*  You need to watch that fight. [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9134.08s)]
*  I got married on Tuesday, so I have an excuse this time. [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9135.32s)]
*  That's a real excuse. [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9138.24s)]
*  But I will go watch this fight. [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9139.36s)]
*  Congratulations. [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9140.76s)]
*  You should watch it because it was very impressive. [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9141.6s)]
*  Because if you watched Caleb Plant fight, [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9145.08s)]
*  if you saw him in the Canelo fight and you saw him, [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9148.24s)]
*  and what is the subsequent fight? [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9150.6s)]
*  Who did he knock out with that vicious left hook? [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9152.08s)]
*  Darrell? [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9155.84s)]
*  I can't remember what the dude's name was. [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9158.28s)]
*  I just remember Caleb Plant losing the fight before. [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9161.32s)]
*  Yeah, Anthony Darrell. [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9165.279999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9166.44s)]
*  Vicious left hook KO. [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9167.52s)]
*  But I'm telling you, man, Benavides just broke him down [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9169.08s)]
*  and was just battering him. [[02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9173.88s)]
*  And he's a big, tall dude. [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9175.6s)]
*  But Benavides was battering him in tight in the clinch. [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9177.4s)]
*  I mean, because Caleb kept trying to grab him. [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9181.08s)]
*  He was grabbing him and hold on to him. [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9183.68s)]
*  Dude, this guy was, I mean, it was a good fight. [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9186.0s)]
*  A good fight, particularly in the beginning. [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9189.04s)]
*  But he was battering him with some vicious punches, man. [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9191.0s)]
*  Was Benavides more impressive than Canelo versus Plant? [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9196.640000000001s)]
*  Well, Canelo stopped him. [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9200.36s)]
*  So you always have to think. [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9202.04s)]
*  I think it was like six rounds. [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9202.880000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you gotta think, well, Canelo might be, [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9203.720000000001s)]
*  I mean, this guy is hard as Benavides hits, [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9205.92s)]
*  Canelo might actually hit harder. [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9208.08s)]
*  Canelo's a monster fighter. [[02:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9209.800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, Canelo hits harder for sure. [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9211.480000000001s)]
*  But Benavides, as far as a young, up and coming, [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9212.480000000001s)]
*  undefeated dude who's real unusual, [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9216.640000000001s)]
*  like real long and strong, [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9219.04s)]
*  like powerful fucking puncher too, man. [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9221.68s)]
*  Fun to watch. [[02:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9224.800000000001s)]
*  And Caleb is slick, dude. [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9226.2s)]
*  Caleb is slick. [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9228.0s)]
*  But he eventually wore on him. [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9229.6s)]
*  He wore on him, just kept coming after him, [[02:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9231.0s)]
*  kept coming after him. [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9233.12s)]
*  Plant has been known to kind of fade. [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9234.2s)]
*  He's got such a sprint heavy sort of style. [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9236.48s)]
*  His style is very, it really almost depends too much [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9239.48s)]
*  upon like fast twitch or something. [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9243.32s)]
*  He has holes in his defense too. [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9246.28s)]
*  Like a lot of holes in his defense. [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9248.36s)]
*  It's a lot of offense without defense built in [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9250.12s)]
*  is kind of like what I've seen [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9252.32s)]
*  when I watch Caleb plant fight. [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9254.32s)]
*  You know, one of the most substantial changes in Canelo [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9256.12s)]
*  from like the early days to the late days [[02:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9259.56s)]
*  is his head movement. [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9261.44s)]
*  That's the big difference, man. [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9262.84s)]
*  Like the Danny Jacobs fight, [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9264.72s)]
*  that's one of the most beautiful displays [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9266.24s)]
*  of head movement in the history of boxing. [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9268.08s)]
*  It was gorgeous. [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9270.52s)]
*  It was like Willie Pepp type shit. [[02:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9271.36s)]
*  Just moving around and the punches were swinging. [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9272.8s)]
*  He was like, nope, not today. [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9275.080000000002s)]
*  He's so nasty. [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9277.2s)]
*  It was beautiful. [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9278.36s)]
*  He's the best counter puncher right now. [[02:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9279.2s)]
*  Yeah, that was really pretty gorgeous, that fight. [[02:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9280.92s)]
*  I just think when he went up to fight Bevol, [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9284.240000000002s)]
*  that's just too much. [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9286.240000000002s)]
*  That's too big. [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9287.12s)]
*  That's too much man, yeah. [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9287.960000000001s)]
*  That's too big, he's big. [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9288.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9289.92s)]
*  A 175 killer versus a 168 killer versus, you know, [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9290.84s)]
*  and really he's a 154 killer, right? [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9294.6s)]
*  He just kind of bulked up. [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9296.960000000001s)]
*  That's too big. [[02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9298.12s)]
*  And Canelo also came into that fight really flat-footed [[02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9298.960000000001s)]
*  and fighting Bevol, trying to throw bombs [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9303.28s)]
*  because he got so comfortable just overpowering people. [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9305.52s)]
*  Yeah, and he didn't box. [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9308.720000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9311.04s)]
*  Bevol was nasty too. [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9311.880000000001s)]
*  And after he knocked out Kovalev, [[02:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9312.92s)]
*  God damn, that was a wild fight. [[02:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9314.52s)]
*  That was fun to watch. [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9315.84s)]
*  Because you could see like he just, [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9317.16s)]
*  Kovalev obviously not the same Kovalev [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9318.560000000001s)]
*  as when he was the champion, you know, [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9321.08s)]
*  back in the Andre Ward days. [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9322.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9324.08s)]
*  But Kovalev was still fucking dangerous. [[02:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9324.92s)]
*  Still like a really good, you know, [[02:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9327.6s)]
*  light heavyweight boxer. [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9331.0s)]
*  Kovalev's one of the best villains of the last 15 years [[02:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9332.6s)]
*  because he lost a lot of the big fights, [[02:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9335.32s)]
*  but he made like the Andre Ward series was incredible. [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9337.199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9341.16s)]
*  The Canelo shit was amazing. [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9342.0s)]
*  Kovalev's a good villain. [[02:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9343.0s)]
*  Bro, he dropped Ward, remember? [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9344.359999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9346.519999999999s)]
*  When Ward came back to win that fight [[02:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9347.359999999999s)]
*  and then Ward fucked him up in the second fight. [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9349.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9351.279999999999s)]
*  You know, Ward was fighting him with one hand. [[02:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9352.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah, Ward is one of the smartest boxers I've ever seen. [[02:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9353.88s)]
*  Ever, ever. [[02:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9356.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9358.199999999999s)]
*  Fought most of his career with one arm. [[02:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9359.039999999999s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9361.08s)]
*  Yeah, his right arm was fucked up. [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9362.08s)]
*  His shoulder fucked up. [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9363.24s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9364.24s)]
*  He had to fight with like one handed, [[02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9365.08s)]
*  like literally one handed, until he got shoulder surgery. [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9368.8s)]
*  And then even, he tore his shoulder when he was very young [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9371.64s)]
*  and they tried to fix it with bands and shit like that. [[02:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9374.4s)]
*  Well, they should have just done surgery. [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9376.6s)]
*  And they didn't do the surgery. [[02:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9378.48s)]
*  And that's why he took the break. [[02:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9379.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9380.52s)]
*  And they took a break and came back [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9381.36s)]
*  and his shoulder was better than ever. [[02:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9382.6s)]
*  But it's still like the guy beat Karl Frosch, [[02:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9384.6s)]
*  beat all those people with like one hand. [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9386.92s)]
*  That Kovalev fight was just crazy [[02:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9388.960000000001s)]
*  because Kovalev had him early on [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9390.92s)]
*  and then Andre just downloaded information, [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9393.88s)]
*  started fighting low to high, high to low, [[02:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9396.56s)]
*  instead of going laterally. [[02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9399.32s)]
*  And Kovalev just could not keep up with him. [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9400.960000000001s)]
*  Like the stuff jab and that was a clinic. [[02:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9403.52s)]
*  He's so smart. [[02:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9407.92s)]
*  And they offered him the Canelo-O'Haveras fight [[02:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9408.84s)]
*  after Canelo knocked out Kovalev. [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9411.72s)]
*  And he's like, nope, I think it'd be better served [[02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9414.52s)]
*  being a broadcaster. [[02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9416.36s)]
*  He was retired, undefeated, [[02:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9417.52s)]
*  multiple weight world champion, gold medalist. [[02:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9420.76s)]
*  Good, good. [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9423.24s)]
*  Cause that Canelo fight would have been tough. [[02:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9424.68s)]
*  I would have loved to see it. [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9426.32s)]
*  But I think Andre Ward is very smart [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9427.640000000001s)]
*  not taking that fight. [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9430.24s)]
*  Well, I feel like if you're gonna have a fight like that, [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9431.16s)]
*  you should be fighting all the time. [[02:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9434.68s)]
*  You should be in peak condition. [[02:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9436.640000000001s)]
*  You shouldn't be on a retirement mindset [[02:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9438.08s)]
*  and then come back. [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9440.24s)]
*  That mindset is very different. [[02:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9441.92s)]
*  The mindset of a dude who's either chasing a championship [[02:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9443.4s)]
*  or maintaining the championship [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9446.24s)]
*  is a Spartan savage mindset. [[02:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9448.32s)]
*  And if you relax and retire, you have to rekindle that beast. [[02:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9451.119999999999s)]
*  You have to restoke those fires. [[02:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9455.6s)]
*  You should probably get some warmup fights inside of you. [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9457.24s)]
*  Yeah, you need to have something you're chasing. [[02:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9459.76s)]
*  Which is why I felt like Triple G coming to fight Canelo [[02:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9462.36s)]
*  has just been so lackluster. [[02:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9465.88s)]
*  The last one was. [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9467.76s)]
*  The last one was fairly, I think, but- [[02:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9469.28s)]
*  The first two were great. [[02:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9471.52s)]
*  Dude, the fucking time doesn't give a shit [[02:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9472.44s)]
*  about your plans. [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9475.08s)]
*  Father of time just starts fucking up your joints, [[02:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9476.68s)]
*  fucking up your back, fucking up your face, [[02:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9478.72s)]
*  fucking up your scar tissue around your eyebrows. [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9480.84s)]
*  Ball shrink. [[02:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9485.96s)]
*  Like I still really- [[02:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9486.8s)]
*  Feet smell. [[02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9487.92s)]
*  I like wanna get after it still most days. [[02:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9488.76s)]
*  Don't do it. [[02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9492.2s)]
*  But I remember when I was younger, all seven days, [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9493.039999999999s)]
*  probably fucking eight hours of the day, [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9496.12s)]
*  I wanted to be productive. [[02:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9498.12s)]
*  Now I'm like, I wanna feel good. [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9500.08s)]
*  I wanna feel good. [[02:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9503.0s)]
*  And then it's the curiosity thing. [[02:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9503.84s)]
*  So I think my shit's better, but I don't have, [[02:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9506.12s)]
*  I'm not working as much. [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9508.52s)]
*  We just, you're very, very privileged [[02:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9510.28s)]
*  that you've accomplished enough [[02:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9512.0s)]
*  so that that part of you is kind of quenched. [[02:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9514.08s)]
*  And really now what you're about is you're still successful, [[02:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9516.48s)]
*  but you're being successful just by chasing your curiosity, [[02:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9519.8s)]
*  which is I think is amazing. [[02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9523.24s)]
*  That's kind of a lot of what podcasts are all about. [[02:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9524.64s)]
*  Podcasts are really all about like chasing curiosity, [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9527.880000000001s)]
*  having conversations, asking questions [[02:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9530.44s)]
*  you're really interested in, finding out stuff about things. [[02:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9532.32s)]
*  It's really about chasing curiosity. [[02:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9535.4s)]
*  Yeah, and it was like, I ended up doing everything [[02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9537.6s)]
*  I wanted to do, restaurant, memoir, the movie. [[02:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9540.64s)]
*  And then I came back and started a podcast with Wifey [[02:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9544.68s)]
*  because I was like, I miss intimate conversation. [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9547.0s)]
*  I miss talking to individual fans. [[02:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9550.44s)]
*  Like I'll respond to them in the comments [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9552.48s)]
*  and I got stuff going on. [[02:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9554.039999999999s)]
*  Cause like as a writer and director, [[02:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9555.08s)]
*  you really only get to make something [[02:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9557.32s)]
*  once every three to five years. [[02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9559.72s)]
*  And that like fallow period is unbearable for me. [[02:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9562.92s)]
*  And so the podcast is like a good way to like every week, [[02:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9566.44s)]
*  like let me use the brain. [[02:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9569.08s)]
*  Let me like open up. [[02:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9570.400000000001s)]
*  Cause I realized I was just like, [[02:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9572.240000000002s)]
*  I'm rotting on my fucking couch. [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9573.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of people who are writers gravitated [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9575.480000000001s)]
*  to podcasts too because it allows them to put out stuff [[02:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9578.880000000001s)]
*  that gets seen by far more people [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9583.720000000001s)]
*  or heard by far more people with far less effort. [[02:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9586.08s)]
*  Like Sam Harris has said that, [[02:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9589.52s)]
*  Sam has written quite a few really great books, [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9591.04s)]
*  but he also does his podcast. [[02:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9594.6s)]
*  And the podcast probably in one episode [[02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9598.04s)]
*  that he does in just a couple of hours [[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9600.28s)]
*  reaches more people than, you know, [[02:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9602.0s)]
*  I mean, how much does the average book sell? [[02:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9605.68s)]
*  How many copies does a book have to sell [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9609.56s)]
*  to get on the New York Times bestseller list? [[02:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9611.72s)]
*  I think maybe first, it's not that much first week. [[02:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9613.800000000001s)]
*  I don't think it's that much, right? [[02:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9617.72s)]
*  It's not that much. [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9618.92s)]
*  I think it's like a couple thousand [[02:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9619.76s)]
*  to get on the New York Times bestseller list. [[02:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9621.24s)]
*  So every episode that he has [[02:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9622.880000000001s)]
*  is a New York Times bestseller. [[02:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9624.4s)]
*  And he does it in just a few hours [[02:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9626.2s)]
*  instead of like months and months and months [[02:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9627.56s)]
*  of writing and editing and soul searching [[02:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9629.6s)]
*  snorting at her all. [[02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9635.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9637.12s)]
*  And it becomes a group project. [[02:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9638.2s)]
*  Like I have very few editors. [[02:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9639.76s)]
*  I have an editor, Rachel, like Audible, she's great. [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9641.28s)]
*  My old editor, Chris Jackson made my shit better, [[02:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9645.44s)]
*  but there's very few people you work with [[02:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9648.12s)]
*  that actually make it better. [[02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9649.960000000001s)]
*  They really just wanna make it more make sense to them. [[02:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9651.68s)]
*  A lot of them. [[02:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9654.880000000001s)]
*  And a lot of them wanna get their greasy little fingers [[02:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9655.92s)]
*  on something, leave their fingerprints. [[02:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9658.240000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9660.44s)]
*  I told Eddie to do it like this. [[02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9661.28s)]
*  Yeah, the worst editors and producers are artists by proxy [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9663.92s)]
*  because they don't wanna take the risk of being an artist. [[02:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9668.08s)]
*  But I'll Rasputin you. [[02:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9671.36s)]
*  And they think you're experts. [[02:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9673.6s)]
*  I am an expert. [[02:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9675.240000000002s)]
*  Listen, I know how to make a film. [[02:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9676.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9678.44s)]
*  I have ideas that are bulletproof. [[02:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9681.28s)]
*  I've been successful on 15 projects. [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9683.84s)]
*  Yeah, it's a weird world, man. [[02:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9687.640000000001s)]
*  It is. [[02:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9689.6s)]
*  If you could be in a self-produced world, [[02:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9690.44s)]
*  you're so much better off. [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9691.480000000001s)]
*  Cause then you have to interact with people [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9692.880000000001s)]
*  that aren't doing their own thing. [[02:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9694.52s)]
*  They're doing other people's things, [[02:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9696.28s)]
*  which may work, but oftentimes doesn't. [[02:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9697.68s)]
*  If you looked at like the formula [[02:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9700.52s)]
*  for creating a good show on television, [[02:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9701.84s)]
*  how many shows do they pick that never become any good? [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9704.48s)]
*  Is it half? [[02:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9707.72s)]
*  Are they even 50% successful? [[02:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9709.119999999999s)]
*  What do you think they are? [[02:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9712.359999999999s)]
*  Like if you had to guess, like let's just go sitcoms. [[02:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9713.199999999999s)]
*  What percentage of sitcoms that they create are any good [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9716.24s)]
*  or become successful? [[02:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9720.279999999999s)]
*  Is it 50? [[02:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9721.84s)]
*  Yo, like I think they make like 250 a year, [[02:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9722.88s)]
*  I think was the number or something like that. [[02:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9726.8s)]
*  And how many do I enjoy and watch? [[02:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9729.08s)]
*  Succession, White Lotus. [[02:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9732.04s)]
*  Do you think Succession is a sitcom? [[02:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9735.0s)]
*  Oh no, that's not a sitcom. [[02:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9737.400000000001s)]
*  No, no, no. [[02:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9738.560000000001s)]
*  My bad, I was giving credit for all of it. [[02:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9739.6s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9741.640000000001s)]
*  But no, sitcom zero. [[02:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9742.480000000001s)]
*  Like for me to what? [[02:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9744.0s)]
*  Zero, like. [[02:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9745.44s)]
*  They're still making them though. [[02:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9746.44s)]
*  They're still making them. [[02:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9747.52s)]
*  Isn't that wild? [[02:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9748.36s)]
*  Yeah, somebody's eating that up. [[02:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9749.2s)]
*  There's a few of them that are good. [[02:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9750.6s)]
*  Miss Patz is really funny. [[02:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9751.68s)]
*  Miss Patz is genuinely very funny. [[02:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9753.320000000002s)]
*  Abbott Elementary is good. [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9754.800000000001s)]
*  I guess that would be good. [[02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9756.080000000002s)]
*  What's Abbott Elementary? [[02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9756.92s)]
*  It's cool, it's about like school teachers in Philadelphia. [[02:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9757.92s)]
*  It's like the office, but it's a workplace comedy, [[02:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9762.64s)]
*  like Zach Fox is in it. [[02:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9765.04s)]
*  And it's in Philadelphia with Teach, you would like it. [[02:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9766.880000000001s)]
*  But it's at the level of a sitcom, like 30 Rock, [[02:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9771.04s)]
*  where it's single camera, it's very elevated, [[02:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9774.8s)]
*  but it's on network television, so technically a sitcom. [[02:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9776.8s)]
*  You know what I watched the first episode of? [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9779.48s)]
*  The Good Place. [[02:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9782.04s)]
*  Oh, is that good? [[02:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9783.92s)]
*  Dude, it's funny, man. [[02:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9785.04s)]
*  Really? [[02:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9786.880000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[02:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9787.72s)]
*  And I watched it. [[02:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9788.54s)]
*  This is one of those, like when you have a wife [[02:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9789.380000000001s)]
*  and daughters, occasionally, this time it was only one [[02:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9791.76s)]
*  of them that had the idea, you have to make sacrifices. [[02:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9795.36s)]
*  You can't watch what you want to watch. [[02:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9799.36s)]
*  Sometimes you have to watch what they want to watch. [[02:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9801.48s)]
*  And they tricked me many times, but not this one. [[02:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9804.039999999999s)]
*  This one, The Good Place is Ted Danson, [[02:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9807.52s)]
*  and what's that pretty lady's name? [[02:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9811.039999999999s)]
*  Who's the? [[02:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9812.96s)]
*  Kristen Bell. [[02:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9813.8s)]
*  Kristen Bell? [[02:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9814.76s)]
*  Kristen Bell. [[02:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9816.039999999999s)]
*  And it's fucking funny, man. [[02:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9817.199999999999s)]
*  I laughed hard. [[02:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9818.72s)]
*  I laughed hard. [[02:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9819.84s)]
*  It's about heaven. [[02:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9821.2s)]
*  I don't want to give away anything, but it was funny. [[02:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9822.32s)]
*  I was like, that's a funny fucking show. [[02:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9825.48s)]
*  So that was an NBC show? [[02:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9827.36s)]
*  I'ma watch it. [[02:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9829.32s)]
*  How many episodes, what does Rotten Tomatoes give it? [[02:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9830.16s)]
*  I think four seasons maybe. [[02:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9832.84s)]
*  Does Rotten Tomatoes say I have shitty taste? [[02:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9834.16s)]
*  Was it four, is Ted Danson dead? [[02:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9838.52s)]
*  No. [[02:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9841.28s)]
*  He's not? [[02:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9842.12s)]
*  No. [[02:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9842.94s)]
*  Oh wow, it's highly rated. [[02:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9843.78s)]
*  He's watching? [[02:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9845.16s)]
*  It's been on Curb Your Enthusiasm. [[02:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9846.0s)]
*  Oh, 97%. [[02:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9846.960000000001s)]
*  Wow, 89% average audience score, [[02:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9849.2s)]
*  97% average tomato meter. [[02:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9852.2s)]
*  I just watched the first, 2016 to what? [[02:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9855.16s)]
*  Yo, I'ma watch this. [[02:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9857.28s)]
*  20, so it was four years. [[02:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9859.2s)]
*  So let's stop, three years. [[02:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9861.28s)]
*  Dude, it's fucking funny. [[02:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9862.48s)]
*  The first episode is at least, I laughed pretty fucking hard. [[02:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9863.64s)]
*  And I was like, this is clever, it's interesting. [[02:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9866.56s)]
*  It's different. [[02:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9869.16s)]
*  You know, the thing for me, well, that's a better era. [[02:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9870.52s)]
*  Right now, I just feel like it's so calculated, [[02:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9873.8s)]
*  algorithmic what shows get picked. [[02:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9877.16s)]
*  It's just like music, TikTok determines everything. [[02:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9880.2s)]
*  And I don't even, it's not that I'm against it. [[02:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9883.0s)]
*  TikTok is dope, it's just that the music industry is like, [[02:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9886.0s)]
*  this is the one metric, this is what we're gonna use [[02:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9889.32s)]
*  to decide which shows. [[02:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9891.960000000001s)]
*  And I think what's cool about podcasts, right, [[02:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9893.64s)]
*  is you've been doing this forever, [[02:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9896.0s)]
*  is I think the podcasts that work and stay and keep fans, [[02:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9898.44s)]
*  it's because the person is intimate. [[02:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9903.12s)]
*  They have a relationship with you [[02:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9905.24s)]
*  and you gave them something fucking real. [[02:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9907.119999999999s)]
*  I think that definitely helps. [[02:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9909.52s)]
*  Cause otherwise, why do they keep downloading episodes? [[02:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9911.52s)]
*  It's fun to think of how you think about conversations. [[02:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9913.68s)]
*  And I don't think we have enough conversations. [[02:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9919.68s)]
*  And one of the things about podcasts is, [[02:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9921.72s)]
*  you get to kind of participate in the conversation [[02:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9924.119999999999s)]
*  just in your head while you're doing something else. [[02:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9926.4s)]
*  So if you have some fucking mundane, boring ass job [[02:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9929.36s)]
*  and you're listening to a podcast, [[02:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9932.32s)]
*  your mind gets to be taking out a little trip [[02:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9934.199999999999s)]
*  and next thing you know, fucking three hours is gone. [[02:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9936.88s)]
*  Your shift is almost over, and you're chilling. [[02:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9939.119999999999s)]
*  The beauty of podcasts is that [[02:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9943.279999999999s)]
*  we all wanna have conversations. [[02:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9945.92s)]
*  And we're all like, hey, if I could talk to Eddie Wong, [[02:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9947.84s)]
*  what would I say? [[02:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9950.88s)]
*  I'll fucking shoot the shit with that dude, [[02:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9951.72s)]
*  that'd be fun. [[02:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9953.6s)]
*  And so that's what we're doing. [[02:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9954.44s)]
*  Like we're doing it like normal. [[02:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9955.76s)]
*  Yeah, everyone's a little lonely. [[02:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9957.44s)]
*  This is how you and I would talk if we were having dinner. [[02:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9958.279999999999s)]
*  Yeah, in the bathroom, we were talking in the bathroom, [[02:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9960.68s)]
*  like taking a piss. [[02:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9962.56s)]
*  It's the same fucking shit. [[02:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9963.4s)]
*  Same exact conversation. [[02:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9964.64s)]
*  We should take a piss together more. [[02:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9966.12s)]
*  Yeah, it's hilarious. [[02:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9967.44s)]
*  It's the same exact kind of conversation. [[02:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9968.720000000001s)]
*  We have it all the time. [[02:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9970.6s)]
*  Anytime I talk to you, it would be like this. [[02:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9971.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9973.08s)]
*  Yeah, but that is fun. [[02:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9973.92s)]
*  And it's, you know, [[02:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9976.0s)]
*  no one would have ever saw that coming though. [[02:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9977.960000000001s)]
*  Like if you were, you can't even blame [[02:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9979.960000000001s)]
*  like some radio network person, [[02:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9981.880000000001s)]
*  they would never saw that shit coming. [[02:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9983.84s)]
*  No, and it wouldn't work on radio [[02:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9985.2s)]
*  because they'd have to fucking put ads in every eight minutes. [[02:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9987.44s)]
*  It wouldn't work on radio [[02:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9990.560000000001s)]
*  because you'd have someone leaning over your shoulder. [[02:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9991.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9993.28s)]
*  That'd be the problem. Pig vomit. [[02:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9994.12s)]
*  If we walked out the door and there's a fucking office [[02:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9994.960000000001s)]
*  and they're like, hey, Eddie, [[02:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9997.6s)]
*  this thing that you keep bringing up, [[02:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=9998.92s)]
*  every time you talk about it, [[02:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10001.0s)]
*  this goes down and that goes up and like, oh. [[02:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10002.36s)]
*  Yeah, no, that was the literal, [[02:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10005.92s)]
*  you remember that movie Private Parts, right? [[02:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10008.160000000002s)]
*  Where pig vomit was just like down. [[02:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10010.6s)]
*  Yeah, the Howard Stern movie, yeah. [[02:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10012.160000000002s)]
*  Yeah, Paul Gimbara was just down his throat. [[02:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10013.28s)]
*  And I was watching that a few months ago, [[02:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10015.68s)]
*  sitting on the couch with my girl and her mom. [[02:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10017.84s)]
*  And that's when I was like, I wanna do a podcast. [[02:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10020.439999999999s)]
*  I'm so sick of studios and everybody just kind of [[02:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10022.119999999999s)]
*  breathing down my neck like fucking pig vomit. [[02:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10025.359999999999s)]
*  But for you, right? [[02:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10027.64s)]
*  When, somebody has to have asked you this, [[02:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10028.679999999998s)]
*  but what made you wanna do a pod? [[02:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10031.56s)]
*  It was just for fun. [[02:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10034.679999999998s)]
*  Well, I'd seen what Tom Green had done in his house. [[02:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10035.8s)]
*  He'd developed some sort of a podcast. [[02:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10039.039999999999s)]
*  Before there were podcasts, that was like 2007. [[02:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10040.92s)]
*  And he was just doing it from a website. [[02:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10043.679999999998s)]
*  And it was like Tom Green TV or something like that. [[02:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10046.279999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I remember that. It was great. [[02:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10048.439999999999s)]
*  And then I watched Anthony Kumia. [[02:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10050.44s)]
*  He did this thing live from the compound [[02:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10051.44s)]
*  where he had like a green screen behind him. [[02:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10053.720000000001s)]
*  And he was like doing karaoke with a machine gun. [[02:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10055.68s)]
*  I was like, what the fuck? [[02:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10057.76s)]
*  Like you could just do it. [[02:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10059.48s)]
*  You could do like a radio show from your house. [[02:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10060.48s)]
*  And so me and Brian Redband just said, let's try it. [[02:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10063.68s)]
*  Just like with a webcam and just talking shit. [[02:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10067.08s)]
*  And then as time went on, [[02:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10069.52s)]
*  like my idea of what it was sort of kind of changed [[02:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10072.2s)]
*  to the point where now it almost feels like, [[02:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10075.84s)]
*  I think certain things that people do, [[02:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10083.44s)]
*  it's almost like that thing wanted to get out there. [[02:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10085.6s)]
*  That thing wanted to be born. [[02:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10088.6s)]
*  That thing wanted to introduce people [[02:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10090.2s)]
*  to all these interesting folks [[02:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10091.76s)]
*  and introduce people to all these different ways [[02:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10092.880000000001s)]
*  of thinking and looking at things. [[02:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10096.4s)]
*  Because that's part of what's fun about it. [[02:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10097.880000000001s)]
*  Like the more people you talk to, [[02:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10099.64s)]
*  the more you get to see patterns [[02:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10100.8s)]
*  that maybe you see in your own self. [[02:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10104.4s)]
*  You get to talk to people [[02:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10106.32s)]
*  and find out why they think what they think. [[02:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10108.08s)]
*  And sort of flavors how you look at yourself, [[02:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10110.08s)]
*  flavors the way you look at the world. [[02:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10112.92s)]
*  We're all better off listening to good conversations. [[02:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10115.84s)]
*  I fucking love listening to a good conversation. [[02:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10119.0s)]
*  Even like I was listening to Douglas Murray [[02:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10121.72s)]
*  having this discussion. [[02:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10126.92s)]
*  They were discussing immigration and what causes inequality. [[02:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10127.96s)]
*  And it's like having a conversation, [[02:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10133.96s)]
*  like interesting conversations that make you think [[02:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10135.48s)]
*  are so fucking critical. [[02:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10137.599999999999s)]
*  Because sometimes you'll like get boxed in on a thought [[02:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10140.039999999999s)]
*  where you give a cursory look at something [[02:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10143.56s)]
*  and you go, well, I have this knee-jerk reaction. [[02:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10145.839999999998s)]
*  That's probably right. [[02:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10148.039999999999s)]
*  And then you watch somebody else talk about it [[02:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10148.88s)]
*  and you go, oh, look at it from their perspective. [[02:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10150.519999999999s)]
*  And if it's an eloquent perspective [[02:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10153.599999999999s)]
*  that's convincing and interesting. [[02:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10155.759999999998s)]
*  I can make, and then someone else has a counter to that. [[02:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10157.56s)]
*  You're like, god damn, he's got some good points too. [[02:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10159.519999999999s)]
*  Holy shit. [[02:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10161.84s)]
*  And it just sort of makes you reassess [[02:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10163.0s)]
*  the way you look at things and why are we so dogmatic [[02:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10165.519999999999s)]
*  and why are we so attached to ideas? [[02:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10168.24s)]
*  What is it about ideas that are so attractive to us [[02:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10170.359999999999s)]
*  that we wanna hang our hat on that idea [[02:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10173.0s)]
*  to show that we're smarter because we believed in that idea? [[02:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10175.679999999998s)]
*  Yeah, conversation at its core, [[02:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10179.599999999999s)]
*  it can be very humbling and enlightening at the same time. [[02:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10182.08s)]
*  It's dope. [[02:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10185.72s)]
*  And then sometimes I like to listen to your homie Tim Dillon [[02:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10186.72s)]
*  just rant by himself. [[02:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10189.439999999999s)]
*  And then I feel like I'm talking to him. [[02:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10190.68s)]
*  And I'm just like, yo, I listened to this guy [[02:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10192.96s)]
*  talk straight for an hour, it's so fire. [[02:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10195.119999999999s)]
*  He's the best ranter that's ever existed. [[02:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10197.279999999999s)]
*  No one rants better than him. [[02:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10199.64s)]
*  When he gets on a subject, [[02:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10201.199999999999s)]
*  especially if it's about corruption [[02:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10202.48s)]
*  or something like it's absolutely ridiculous. [[02:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10204.199999999999s)]
*  Don't boss. [[02:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10205.88s)]
*  He goes for it. [[02:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10206.72s)]
*  He fucking goes for it. [[02:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10208.8s)]
*  He's so funny, man. [[02:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10210.0s)]
*  He's the greatest ranter. [[02:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10212.279999999999s)]
*  Him and my mom, my mom's a really good ranter. [[02:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10213.56s)]
*  They're the best. [[02:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10218.96s)]
*  There's a few out there. [[02:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10220.52s)]
*  Bill Burr is a great ranter. [[02:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10221.6s)]
*  I think Tim is the funniest ranter ever. [[02:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10224.72s)]
*  I really do. [[02:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10227.2s)]
*  When he just fucking goes for it. [[02:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10228.8s)]
*  And also he's a smart guy. [[02:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10231.0s)]
*  So his takes, they make sense. [[02:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10233.28s)]
*  They make a lot of sense and they cut through the noise. [[02:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10235.6s)]
*  That's the thing about him that I'm like, [[02:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10238.32s)]
*  oh, you don't care if this hurts somebody's feelings [[02:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10240.24s)]
*  because it's truthful. [[02:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10243.72s)]
*  And that's what I fuck with him about. [[02:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10245.28s)]
*  He's very truthful. [[02:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10247.16s)]
*  Well, at this point in time, [[02:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10248.4s)]
*  it seems like that needs to be a thing. [[02:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10249.52s)]
*  Because we're trying to protect people's feelings, [[02:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10254.76s)]
*  we're allowing all kinds of fucking madness in the world. [[02:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10256.4s)]
*  But the crazy shit about Tim Dillon's shows, right? [[02:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10259.56s)]
*  I went to his show, [[02:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10261.68s)]
*  like I drove all the way to Irvine to watch this guy. [[02:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10262.52s)]
*  And I don't know if his audience is in on the joke. [[02:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10265.279999999999s)]
*  Like they're laughing at it earnestly [[02:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10268.72s)]
*  when he's like laughing at them. [[02:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10270.64s)]
*  And I'm like, [[02:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10272.64s)]
*  Yield to his audience? [[02:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10273.88s)]
*  It's a bit of two things happening simultaneously. [[02:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10275.48s)]
*  Because Tim is conservative and he's also gay. [[02:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10279.0s)]
*  He's very insightful and funny, [[02:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10281.880000000001s)]
*  but he's also making fun of morons. [[02:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10283.84s)]
*  It's like he's doing both things simultaneously. [[02:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10285.76s)]
*  And what he's essentially doing is just being [[02:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10289.0s)]
*  fucking hugely entertaining. [[02:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10291.04s)]
*  Like that's part of what the whole thing is. [[02:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10292.92s)]
*  It's just hugely entertaining. [[02:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10295.04s)]
*  And for whatever reason they laugh at it, [[02:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10297.28s)]
*  if they don't get it, [[02:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10298.92s)]
*  they're not even in on the joke, it's still funny. [[02:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10299.76s)]
*  I don't even know if I would fully categorize him [[02:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10302.12s)]
*  as conservative. [[02:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10305.04s)]
*  Because there's certain takes of his [[02:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10307.04s)]
*  that are like anti, he's very anti-war. [[02:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10308.64s)]
*  Yes, I wouldn't say maybe conservative's not the correct, [[02:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10310.96s)]
*  right of center I would say. [[02:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10315.08s)]
*  Yeah. Right of center. [[02:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10316.8s)]
*  I would agree there. [[02:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10317.92s)]
*  Yeah, that's the problem, right? [[02:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10318.92s)]
*  Is that we have two choices, conservative or liberal. [[02:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10320.88s)]
*  I'm so much more liberal than I am conservative. [[02:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10323.96s)]
*  So much more on most things. [[02:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10325.96s)]
*  But there's a couple things where I'm like, [[02:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10327.8s)]
*  hey, hard work's important, hey, [[02:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10329.52s)]
*  maybe you should be able to have a gun, hey. [[02:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10333.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10335.48s)]
*  There's a few of those things. [[02:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10336.56s)]
*  I would say Tim is logical, like a lot of his takes, [[02:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10338.56s)]
*  I'm like, that makes a lot of sense. [[02:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10341.44s)]
*  Very logical, very well thought out and very informed. [[02:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10342.279999999999s)]
*  He's not talking out of his ass like me. [[02:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10345.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10347.52s)]
*  And he's not like, he's down for diversity. [[02:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10348.68s)]
*  He's getting, you know, like on a lot of the cultural issues, [[02:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10351.56s)]
*  he's pretty progressive. [[02:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10354.08s)]
*  But he's also, he's very progressive, [[02:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10354.92s)]
*  but he's also like real honest about what's going on here. [[02:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10356.36s)]
*  And that's part of the problem, you know? [[02:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10358.84s)]
*  I haven't seen his take on the school shooter, [[02:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10360.76s)]
*  but I'm sure it's gonna be a doozy. [[02:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10362.96s)]
*  This whole thing is so crazy, man. [[02:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10365.599999999999s)]
*  It's so terrifying that someone would wanna do that to kids. [[02:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10368.119999999999s)]
*  It's so terrifying. [[02:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10372.08s)]
*  It's really upsetting. [[02:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10373.84s)]
*  It's really upsetting. [[02:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10375.56s)]
*  It's just- Every time. [[02:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10376.679999999998s)]
*  They, you know, I feel like there's gonna come a time [[02:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10377.8s)]
*  where we decide that the only way to stop this [[02:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10381.199999999999s)]
*  is armed guards, which is no one wants to go to that place. [[02:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10383.76s)]
*  No one wants to have armed guards in front of every school. [[02:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10389.48s)]
*  We never had that before. [[02:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10392.84s)]
*  Why do we have that now? [[02:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10394.04s)]
*  And I get it. [[02:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10395.92s)]
*  I get that no one would want that. [[02:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10397.84s)]
*  I mean, it's horrific. [[02:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10400.0s)]
*  But I also get that like, [[02:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10402.08s)]
*  I don't see any other way to protect. [[02:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10406.04s)]
*  This idea that you're gonna take all the guns away, [[02:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10408.24s)]
*  they're not gonna go for that. [[02:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10410.84s)]
*  It's not in the constitution. [[02:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10411.8s)]
*  It's not in the Bill of Rights. [[02:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10412.96s)]
*  You're not gonna- [[02:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10413.88s)]
*  The Second Amendment, [[02:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10414.92s)]
*  people aren't gonna just give their guns up [[02:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10416.24s)]
*  as fucked up as that sounds, [[02:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10418.88s)]
*  because it's not the law abiding people with guns [[02:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10420.4s)]
*  that are the problem. [[02:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10422.96s)]
*  It's people with mental health problems. [[02:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10423.8s)]
*  That's the problem. [[02:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10426.48s)]
*  And they get ahold of guns. [[02:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10427.599999999999s)]
*  So how do you stop the people with mental health problems [[02:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10429.08s)]
*  from getting ahold of guns and doing this? [[02:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10432.519999999999s)]
*  That's the real question. [[02:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10433.96s)]
*  And I don't know the fucking answer. [[02:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10435.519999999999s)]
*  And I don't think anybody does. [[02:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10437.519999999999s)]
*  That's why no one's done anything. [[02:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10438.599999999999s)]
*  And the best that anybody does [[02:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10440.119999999999s)]
*  is put armed guards in front of schools. [[02:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10441.759999999998s)]
*  And, you know, and then people get upset on social media [[02:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10444.679999999998s)]
*  and they talk about taking guns away. [[02:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10447.72s)]
*  And then it becomes a big discussion [[02:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10449.4s)]
*  of whether or not that's the answer to this [[02:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10452.68s)]
*  and whether or not that promotes tyranny, [[02:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10454.800000000001s)]
*  whether or not disarming the people [[02:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10457.880000000001s)]
*  is like good for us overall. [[02:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10460.48s)]
*  Is there anything that's a net positive [[02:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10462.68s)]
*  about the country being armed? [[02:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10464.36s)]
*  Is there anything that's a net positive [[02:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10466.52s)]
*  about the Second Amendment? [[02:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10468.12s)]
*  And when those conversations happen, [[02:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10469.960000000001s)]
*  that's when things get very interesting. [[02:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10471.880000000001s)]
*  And you find out why we agree on certain things, [[02:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10474.0s)]
*  why we disagree on other things. [[02:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10478.68s)]
*  What we think is the cause of these horrific tragedies. [[02:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10480.439999999999s)]
*  And one of the major causes is clearly [[02:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10484.88s)]
*  that to order to do something like that, [[02:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10488.199999999999s)]
*  something has to be horribly wrong. [[02:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10490.96s)]
*  And we have to figure out like, [[02:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10493.88s)]
*  is there a way to spot that? [[02:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10496.08s)]
*  Is there a way to stop that? [[02:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10497.679999999998s)]
*  Other than armed guards, [[02:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10499.199999999999s)]
*  is there a way to reach that person? [[02:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10500.4s)]
*  Is there, should we be more sensitive about people? [[02:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10502.759999999998s)]
*  Or is it impossible to detect? [[02:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10505.8s)]
*  Some people just hide it until they wanna do it. [[02:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10508.24s)]
*  I don't know, I don't know the answer. [[02:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10510.6s)]
*  It's fucked though, dude, it's fucked. [[02:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10512.56s)]
*  It's really scary shit. [[02:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10515.279999999999s)]
*  It's really scary shit how often it's happening. [[02:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10517.119999999999s)]
*  I would have to say that school shootings [[02:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10521.6s)]
*  are the most disturbing genre of news. [[02:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10524.16s)]
*  Like I get the saddest, like I will cry. [[02:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10526.72s)]
*  Like the Odessa one, I was like, [[02:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10529.8s)]
*  this one was really rough. [[02:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10532.48s)]
*  Yesterday's is really rough. [[02:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10533.96s)]
*  The thing for me though is I feel [[02:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10536.04s)]
*  that a large part of the issue [[02:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10537.88s)]
*  is that we're always arguing about the exact cause. [[02:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10540.4s)]
*  And my thing is, this is a multi-cause issue. [[02:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10543.96s)]
*  This is a complete reflection of our society. [[02:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10547.28s)]
*  And we're wasting time arguing, [[02:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10551.44s)]
*  is it the guns? [[02:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10555.28s)]
*  Is it mental health? [[02:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10556.2s)]
*  I really feel it's a lot of things combined. [[02:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10558.24s)]
*  The guns aren't shooting people themselves, [[02:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10562.6s)]
*  but the guns are very available [[02:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10565.36s)]
*  to people that probably should not have them. [[02:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10567.16s)]
*  And then it gets caught up in like, [[02:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10569.92s)]
*  are we taking away the guns? [[02:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10572.24s)]
*  I'm like, that's actually not the issue. [[02:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10573.52s)]
*  How can we stop this from happening? [[02:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10575.32s)]
*  Let's all get together and be like, [[02:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10577.24s)]
*  we don't wanna see kids shot in school. [[02:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10579.119999999999s)]
*  This is the worst thing that can possibly happen [[02:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10581.039999999999s)]
*  in your society. [[02:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10583.119999999999s)]
*  And just shut it down. [[02:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10584.52s)]
*  And like let's say we put the armed guards at the school, [[02:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10585.52s)]
*  well, they still can shoot people at a supermarket. [[02:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10588.44s)]
*  They could still shoot them at gymnastics class. [[02:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10590.76s)]
*  These people, I think are just very, [[02:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10593.16s)]
*  there's something wrong. [[02:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10596.039999999999s)]
*  They're very unhappy. [[02:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10597.0s)]
*  They're very angry. [[02:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10597.84s)]
*  They want to do something to bring us to our knees. [[02:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10598.66s)]
*  I can't say what mental health issue [[02:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10602.76s)]
*  is afflicting each one of these shooters. [[02:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10607.0s)]
*  Something is wrong. [[02:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10609.4s)]
*  But I do also feel that until we get ahold of this [[02:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10612.08s)]
*  and until we can heal as a society [[02:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10617.119999999999s)]
*  and people don't hate each other so much, [[02:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10619.68s)]
*  not allowing the guns to be this available to people [[02:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10622.36s)]
*  isn't the worst idea. [[02:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10627.960000000001s)]
*  The problem is they're already there. [[02:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10629.92s)]
*  They're already available. [[02:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10632.720000000001s)]
*  There's too many of them. [[02:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10633.720000000001s)]
*  Like if you tried to stop the flow, [[02:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10634.960000000001s)]
*  like first of all, they're constantly making new ones. [[02:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10637.32s)]
*  So think of that. [[02:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10640.04s)]
*  And then second of all, [[02:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10640.960000000001s)]
*  there's 400 million guns in America right now. [[02:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10641.800000000001s)]
*  So like stop all production, stop all production, [[02:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10644.640000000001s)]
*  stop all sales. [[02:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10647.880000000001s)]
*  You still have 400 million guns. [[02:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10648.74s)]
*  I like to take- [[02:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10651.359999999999s)]
*  There's literally no way to stop it. [[02:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10652.199999999999s)]
*  I do this mental, [[02:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10654.039999999999s)]
*  this is the mental gymnastics that happen. [[02:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10655.439999999999s)]
*  When I'm trying to figure something out [[02:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10657.08s)]
*  that I cannot figure out like this issue of school shooters, [[02:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10658.359999999999s)]
*  I try to get into an analogous or metaphorical place. [[02:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10660.88s)]
*  So let's, if we look at gun violence like inflation [[02:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10664.599999999999s)]
*  and then we're the fed, the guns are there. [[02:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10668.519999999999s)]
*  I agree with you. [[02:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10671.72s)]
*  They're already out here. [[02:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10672.56s)]
*  Prices are high like inflation. [[02:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10673.439999999999s)]
*  Inflation is in our society. [[02:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10674.8s)]
*  So people want to stop inflation, [[02:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10677.0s)]
*  take back the guns, stop lending free money out, [[02:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10680.12s)]
*  you know, like, but is inflation going down? [[02:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10683.960000000001s)]
*  The fear that people have is the government [[02:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10685.800000000001s)]
*  has already shown that even with an armed populist, [[02:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10688.400000000001s)]

*  and to make people follow rules that they create [[02:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10696.0s)]
*  that may not be in your best interest. [[02:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10700.740000000002s)]
*  And over time, it will be revealed [[02:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10703.220000000001s)]
*  that it's not your best interest and you have no recourse. [[02:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10705.36s)]
*  And people are scared that if they didn't have guns, [[02:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10707.960000000001s)]
*  if they're treating us like that and people have guns, [[02:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10710.960000000001s)]
*  how would the government treat us? [[02:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10714.02s)]
*  If they were the ones that had all the power. [[02:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10715.48s)]
*  And I think that's a real good fear [[02:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10717.960000000001s)]
*  if you look at human history. [[02:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10720.44s)]
*  But I don't think that there's a utopian answer to this. [[02:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10722.08s)]
*  It's all bad when this happens. [[02:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10727.92s)]
*  And there's no, no one's making a clear case [[02:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10731.24s)]
*  to how to avoid tyranny and stop this from happening. [[02:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10735.480000000001s)]
*  The best I've heard is armed guards. [[02:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10740.6s)]
*  So when a lot of people will be like, [[02:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10743.12s)]
*  these conservative nutbags that want their guns, [[02:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10744.720000000001s)]
*  I'm like, all right, if you're already looking at them [[02:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10748.480000000001s)]
*  like that, then you can't see the issue [[02:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10750.9s)]
*  because nothing is this clear cut. [[02:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10752.640000000001s)]
*  It's fun calling them conservative nutbags [[02:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10755.4s)]
*  want their guns. [[02:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10757.12s)]
*  Yeah, it's fun, but if we care about these kids, [[02:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10757.960000000001s)]
*  it's important to be like, all right, [[02:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10761.480000000001s)]
*  let's give credence to what they're saying, [[02:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10763.32s)]
*  which is, all right, I'm afraid of a government [[02:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10765.8s)]
*  that runs unchecked. [[02:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10769.119999999999s)]
*  It's a legitimate common sense thing. [[02:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10770.72s)]
*  I could see how a human being [[02:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10772.6s)]
*  would want to worry about that. [[02:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10774.119999999999s)]
*  Then what I would say to the person is, [[02:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10776.16s)]
*  do you, have you seen Waco on Showtime? [[02:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10777.72s)]
*  Do you think that you and your homies [[02:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10781.8s)]
*  with some ammunition can actually defend [[02:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10784.02s)]
*  and sustain a campaign against America within America? [[02:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10786.88s)]
*  No. [[02:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10790.92s)]
*  No. [[02:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10791.76s)]
*  So how would we, let's say, [[02:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10792.6s)]
*  let's put our brains together. [[02:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10794.16s)]
*  If the fear is an unchecked government [[02:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10795.56s)]
*  and we don't want to live in a place like that, [[02:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10799.28s)]
*  how do we handle that? [[03:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10803.6s)]
*  Well, get rich, have a business like Amazon, [[03:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10804.86s)]
*  have a business like Apple, have fucking lobbyists. [[03:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10809.56s)]
*  It's business. [[03:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10812.92s)]
*  Business is how you hold governments accountable. [[03:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10813.76s)]
*  It's not the guns. [[03:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10815.76s)]
*  That's what I would try to explain to people. [[03:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10816.66s)]
*  So you would tell someone [[03:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10818.36s)]
*  if they want to change the world, become Apple. [[03:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10819.28s)]
*  Make a new Apple and then just take over. [[03:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10821.0s)]
*  Leverage. [[03:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10823.119999999999s)]
*  It's leverage. [[03:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10824.8s)]
*  It's hard. [[03:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10825.64s)]
*  You're literally saying make an Apple, make Apple. [[03:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10826.46s)]
*  Make the most successful company [[03:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10828.8s)]
*  in the history of the world. [[03:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10830.679999999998s)]
*  But it would be even more ridiculous [[03:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10831.679999999998s)]
*  to give someone an AR-15 and say, [[03:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10833.419999999998s)]
*  yo, defend this country. [[03:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10835.24s)]
*  Yeah, you're not gonna defend. [[03:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10838.199999999999s)]
*  But you also have to recognize this. [[03:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10840.4s)]
*  That's how ridiculous. [[03:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10842.32s)]
*  But there's very, [[03:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10843.16s)]
*  we're looking at very abstract concepts [[03:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10844.0s)]
*  of the country. [[03:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10846.0s)]
*  The country is comprised of people. [[03:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10847.279999999999s)]
*  And those people are not rich. [[03:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10850.64s)]
*  The people that are in the military, [[03:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10852.76s)]
*  that are doing the bidding of the military, [[03:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10854.4s)]
*  they won't do it. [[03:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10856.039999999999s)]
*  See, this is where it becomes a real problem. [[03:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10857.4s)]
*  If you tell the people [[03:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10859.48s)]
*  that they have to go after their own neighbors [[03:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10861.359999999999s)]
*  for something that doesn't make any sense, [[03:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10864.24s)]
*  that will be where the rubber meets the road. [[03:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10865.96s)]
*  So the thing is like Jordan Peterson [[03:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10867.519999999999s)]
*  talks about this often. [[03:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10869.119999999999s)]
*  That the way things change is not all at once. [[03:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10870.48s)]
*  The way these things change [[03:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10873.519999999999s)]
*  are in these little small steps [[03:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10875.679999999998s)]
*  where it's almost unrecognizable. [[03:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10877.619999999999s)]
*  And you give into it, [[03:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10879.16s)]
*  and then you're a little bit further down the road. [[03:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10880.4s)]
*  And then you give into another little insult, [[03:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10882.04s)]
*  and you're a little bit further down the road. [[03:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10884.160000000002s)]
*  And over time you look, [[03:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10885.720000000001s)]
*  and you've given up an insane amount of your rights. [[03:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10887.68s)]
*  And then you live in a dictatorship. [[03:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10891.0s)]
*  And this is what people worry about [[03:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10892.68s)]
*  with any control that the government has [[03:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10895.400000000001s)]
*  more than it has now. [[03:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10898.18s)]
*  This is what people worried about [[03:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10899.400000000001s)]
*  whenever they talk about extreme taxes. [[03:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10900.640000000001s)]
*  Like extreme, [[03:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10903.880000000001s)]
*  like when you, [[03:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10904.720000000001s)]
*  and when the government in California [[03:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10905.54s)]
*  raised the taxes up to 14%, [[03:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10906.880000000001s)]
*  people were like, [[03:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10908.480000000001s)]
*  what the fuck are you fucking, [[03:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10909.32s)]
*  you position. [[03:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10911.44s)]
*  They're just stealing money from you. [[03:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10913.16s)]
*  And they would like, [[03:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10914.480000000001s)]
*  and there's income inequality, [[03:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10915.32s)]
*  and we have to take care of it [[03:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10917.28s)]
*  by taxing the fuck out of you. [[03:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10918.68s)]
*  And then where does the money go? [[03:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10920.640000000001s)]
*  Does it fix anything? [[03:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10921.68s)]
*  No, no, they're stealing money. [[03:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10922.52s)]
*  And there's people that think [[03:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10924.800000000001s)]
*  because they're liberals that that's a good idea. [[03:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10925.960000000001s)]
*  We should raise the taxes and no one should be rich. [[03:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10928.44s)]
*  Well then you know who's rich? [[03:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10930.92s)]
*  The government. [[03:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10932.0s)]
*  They have all your fucking money, [[03:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10932.82s)]
*  and you're not gonna work as much. [[03:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10933.92s)]
*  Cause none of this is good. [[03:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10935.4s)]
*  Because this society, [[03:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10937.04s)]
*  this country wants us stupid. [[03:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10939.12s)]
*  So they offer us two really stupid, [[03:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10941.92s)]
*  ineffective solutions [[03:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10944.44s)]
*  in the Democrats and Republicans. [[03:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10945.68s)]
*  And they're both Rube Goldbergs. [[03:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10947.640000000001s)]
*  And they set up a, [[03:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10949.2s)]
*  it's WWF man. [[03:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10950.68s)]
*  You remember those Rube Goldbergs, [[03:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10952.320000000002s)]
*  you like put a ball and it goes around [[03:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10953.52s)]
*  and all these things happen. [[03:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10955.44s)]
*  So like, if you disagree with this, [[03:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10956.68s)]
*  then this is where it ends up and yada yada. [[03:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10958.480000000001s)]
*  The one idea we talked about today [[03:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10961.800000000001s)]
*  that I do think would hold governments accountable to us [[03:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10963.92s)]
*  is the idea of global mobility. [[03:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10967.56s)]
*  If the countries are competing for citizens, [[03:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10969.960000000001s)]
*  then we theoretically would have the best deal. [[03:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10972.84s)]
*  That would be wild. [[03:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10976.08s)]
*  If we just all agree. [[03:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10977.24s)]
*  But the problem with that is the only way to do that, [[03:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10979.48s)]
*  you have to have some sort of a government. [[03:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10981.52s)]
*  And this sounds very suspiciously [[03:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10983.6s)]
*  like some one world government shit. [[03:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10986.84s)]
*  And that is the last thing you want. [[03:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10989.64s)]
*  We don't want one world government. [[03:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10991.04s)]
*  Right. [[03:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10992.32s)]
*  Countries competing as businesses [[03:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10993.32s)]
*  for us as customers to live there. [[03:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10995.88s)]
*  So if we all just agreed, [[03:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10998.0s)]
*  hey, let's stop with this fucking killing each other [[03:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=10999.36s)]
*  and just compete for people to move to your spot. [[03:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11002.4s)]
*  It's like Florida and Texas. [[03:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11007.08s)]
*  They offered you no income tax, right? [[03:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11008.52s)]
*  So this competitive. [[03:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11010.68s)]
*  Discussion that I was telling you about with Douglas Murray, [[03:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11012.16s)]
*  one of the things they were talking about [[03:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11014.72s)]
*  was the exploitation of people in Mexico [[03:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11016.039999999999s)]
*  with cheap labor that's forcing them to want to come [[03:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11020.0s)]
*  to the United States. [[03:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11023.36s)]
*  It's a very good point. [[03:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11024.2s)]
*  It's an interesting point, right? [[03:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11025.04s)]
*  Like what is wrong down south [[03:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11026.24s)]
*  where they're risking their fucking lives [[03:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11029.64s)]
*  and their babies lives to come up here? [[03:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11031.800000000001s)]
*  How did this happen? [[03:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11033.64s)]
*  And are we to blame? [[03:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11034.84s)]
*  Is automobile manufacturing moving there? [[03:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11037.6s)]
*  Is all these different factories and plants moving there? [[03:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11041.68s)]
*  And then people knowing [[03:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11045.0s)]
*  that if you just get across that river, [[03:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11046.24s)]
*  you make real money. [[03:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11047.52s)]
*  You make real money. [[03:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11048.68s)]
*  Like you get rich. [[03:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11049.880000000001s)]
*  You just work hard. [[03:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11050.84s)]
*  You can get ahead. [[03:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11051.68s)]
*  But why can't you get ahead over there? [[03:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11053.6s)]
*  Like what is wrong? [[03:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11055.16s)]
*  What happened? [[03:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11056.52s)]
*  It's probably partially to do [[03:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11057.56s)]
*  with moving manufacturing over there [[03:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11059.6s)]
*  for extremely cheap labor, right? [[03:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11061.28s)]
*  And also America has always kind of made it a business [[03:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11064.52s)]
*  to cripple Mexico. [[03:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11070.880000000001s)]
*  We're so embedded with Mexico [[03:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11073.0s)]
*  because it's classic country strategy [[03:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11074.92s)]
*  to weaken your closest neighbor. [[03:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11079.04s)]
*  Like Mexico cannot be a threat to America. [[03:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11081.48s)]
*  So I think there's a lot of Mexican government [[03:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11084.8s)]
*  that we're involved in. [[03:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11089.16s)]
*  I'd say try this, [[03:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11091.24s)]
*  but the problem is the bottom of it's broken. [[03:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11092.08s)]
*  You're gonna get a mouthful of weed. [[03:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11094.24s)]
*  No, that's cool. [[03:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11095.64s)]
*  Do your best. [[03:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11096.48s)]
*  Do your best with that mouthful of weed. [[03:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11097.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11101.4s)]
*  Yeah, I told you, it's terrible. [[03:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11102.32s)]
*  It's terrible. [[03:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11103.6s)]
*  I think what everybody wants is to be happy [[03:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11105.64s)]
*  and to enjoy life and to pursue your dreams. [[03:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11108.24s)]
*  Do the thing that you enjoy doing. [[03:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11111.32s)]
*  That's what everybody wants. [[03:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11113.56s)]
*  The more we can move towards that collectively [[03:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11115.28s)]
*  as a society, the better it is. [[03:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11117.08s)]
*  And I don't know how to do that. [[03:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11118.44s)]
*  And I don't know if there's a way we can like, [[03:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11120.24s)]
*  just like, instead of looking at things [[03:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11125.48s)]
*  at right versus left, it's like, what do we all agree on? [[03:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11127.16s)]
*  Can we find the stuff we agree on? [[03:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11129.8s)]
*  Something about that? [[03:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11131.68s)]
*  And I think too, it's just because the idea of identity [[03:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11132.64s)]
*  is tied to country and family. [[03:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11136.28s)]
*  You talk to any person. [[03:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11139.800000000001s)]
*  Where it gets dicey and where things stop making sense [[03:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11141.44s)]
*  is when it gets down to family, [[03:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11145.400000000001s)]
*  or it gets down to culture and religion, [[03:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11147.480000000001s)]
*  because you've basically blacked out those areas [[03:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11150.36s)]
*  of your brain and consciousness where you're like, [[03:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11153.52s)]
*  I'm not gonna open that Pandora's box. [[03:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11155.6s)]
*  But if you open it, it's fucking scary the first 10 years. [[03:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11158.52s)]
*  But after a while, you're like, [[03:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11162.36s)]
*  no, I'm glad I considered that. [[03:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11163.560000000001s)]
*  I'm glad I thought about that, [[03:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11165.12s)]
*  because I'm not so tied to this country or identity [[03:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11166.68s)]
*  or even this fucking family. [[03:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11169.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11171.12s)]
*  And we shouldn't be tied to any identity. [[03:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11172.68s)]
*  Especially like, ideological, [[03:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11174.960000000001s)]
*  like a left wing or a right wing. [[03:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11178.04s)]
*  I think it's like cults, man. [[03:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11179.52s)]
*  I think it's not much different than people [[03:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11180.76s)]
*  that have like cult-like thinking. [[03:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11182.6s)]
*  I have a friend of mine, [[03:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11186.08s)]
*  and she was telling me today, in fact, [[03:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11187.400000000001s)]
*  that she grew up in a cult. [[03:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11190.52s)]
*  She was telling me this whole thing. [[03:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11193.0s)]
*  They told her she was a prophet. [[03:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11194.28s)]
*  And when she realized the cult was fake, [[03:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11196.08s)]
*  she was like, thank God I could be a normal person. [[03:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11198.24s)]
*  Thought I was a prophet. [[03:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11200.32s)]
*  Like, people get sucked in. [[03:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11201.44s)]
*  They get sucked into that. [[03:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11205.199999999999s)]
*  They get sucked into being a right wing person. [[03:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11206.88s)]
*  They get sucked into being a left wing person. [[03:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11208.92s)]
*  They get sucked into being an Antifa. [[03:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11211.24s)]
*  They get sucked into being a Proud Boys. [[03:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11213.119999999999s)]
*  People are fucking malleable, man, in the weirdest way. [[03:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11215.24s)]
*  And we gotta recognize that and stop thinking [[03:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11218.88s)]
*  that those people on the right, [[03:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11221.32s)]
*  I don't even understand how you think over there. [[03:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11222.68s)]
*  I don't know how you sleep at night. [[03:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11224.76s)]
*  And they're looking the same way as you. [[03:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11226.44s)]
*  Like, you're fucking idiot. [[03:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11227.84s)]
*  You don't know who runs the banks. [[03:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11229.119999999999s)]
*  You don't know who's the military industrial complex. [[03:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11230.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's because you attach meaning to shit [[03:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11234.72s)]
*  that has no fucking meaning. [[03:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11237.64s)]
*  And like, I almost ruined my own goddamn wedding last week [[03:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11239.84s)]
*  because my girl's pregnant, [[03:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11243.0s)]
*  and she didn't wanna come to the dinner [[03:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11245.4s)]
*  the night before the wedding. [[03:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11247.24s)]
*  And I kept calling it a rehearsal dinner. [[03:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11248.44s)]
*  But it's a fucking shotgun wedding with nine people. [[03:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11250.279999999999s)]
*  No one's rehearsing shit. [[03:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11252.960000000001s)]
*  Where everyone's just there being like, [[03:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11255.24s)]
*  get her on the insurance. [[03:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11257.08s)]
*  And she didn't wanna come to dinner. [[03:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11259.44s)]
*  I got really upset. [[03:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11261.960000000001s)]
*  I felt embarrassed. [[03:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11263.16s)]
*  I was like, how could you embarrass me [[03:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11264.08s)]
*  in front of my family and the two friends that are here? [[03:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11265.92s)]
*  Like, why would you not come? [[03:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11269.08s)]
*  And she's like, because it's not a rehearsal dinner, [[03:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11270.880000000001s)]
*  it doesn't mean what you're attaching this meaning to. [[03:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11273.04s)]
*  I love you, I wanna marry you. [[03:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11277.08s)]
*  I don't feel good. [[03:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11278.76s)]

*  Oh no. [[03:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11283.0s)]
*  And I was like, if you don't come to dinner, [[03:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11283.92s)]
*  I'm not marrying you. [[03:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11285.76s)]

*  And she didn't come and she goes, you know what? [[03:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11289.4s)]
*  I don't wanna marry you. [[03:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11291.48s)]
*  And 7 a.m. of the day of the wedding last week, [[03:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11293.039999999999s)]
*  I thought I wasn't getting married. [[03:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11296.84s)]
*  Oh no. [[03:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11298.4s)]
*  I was in shambles and she brought me to my knees [[03:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11299.48s)]
*  and I literally, I just had to say to her, I said, [[03:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11302.199999999999s)]
*  wrong or right, I really can't see my life without you. [[03:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11306.52s)]
*  I can't. [[03:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11310.76s)]
*  And I was like, for once, I don't need to try to be right. [[03:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11312.92s)]
*  I don't need to win a fucking argument. [[03:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11315.359999999999s)]
*  I don't need to attach meaning to this thing [[03:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11317.72s)]
*  that doesn't mean shit. [[03:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11319.88s)]
*  Because what would be really whack [[03:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11320.92s)]
*  is if I didn't get to live my life with you. [[03:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11323.8s)]
*  How many people have made the wrong choice [[03:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11325.84s)]
*  like that with someone? [[03:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11327.56s)]
*  And then wound up just fucking miserable [[03:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11329.439999999999s)]
*  and you see that person go off to get married [[03:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11332.48s)]
*  to someone else and have kids, like, oh no. [[03:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11334.24s)]
*  Do the moment flash before my eyes [[03:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11337.84s)]
*  and I like, it was a moment of truth [[03:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11339.76s)]
*  and for two and a half hours, I really, [[03:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11343.04s)]
*  because she left, she packed her bags and left, [[03:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11345.44s)]
*  didn't tell me she went to her mom's room [[03:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11347.68s)]
*  but I thought she left left. [[03:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11349.24s)]
*  And I had to sit there and just be like, [[03:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11351.16s)]
*  dude, very few things are worth it [[03:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11354.28s)]
*  but this relationship, like romance, love, that's worth it. [[03:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11357.48s)]
*  This other shit's not worth it. [[03:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11362.880000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well, it's so tempting in the moment [[03:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11364.44s)]
*  when you're hot and you're mad, [[03:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11368.68s)]
*  just go, well fuck this little thing. [[03:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11370.880000000001s)]
*  I'll fucking move on with my life. [[03:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11372.960000000001s)]
*  It's easy to bail on things. [[03:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11376.720000000001s)]
*  But it's also, it depends entirely upon the relationship. [[03:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11378.12s)]
*  Seems like you have a really good relationship. [[03:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11380.720000000001s)]
*  Sometimes people should bail. [[03:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11382.92s)]
*  Yeah, no, sometimes you gotta bail. [[03:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11385.36s)]
*  Sometimes you gotta bail. [[03:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11387.84s)]
*  This one, I had to stay in because I'm like, [[03:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11389.52s)]
*  I've never felt this way, the feelings are real. [[03:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11392.64s)]
*  But if the feelings weren't real, yeah, [[03:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11394.960000000001s)]
*  get the fuck out. [[03:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11396.6s)]
*  Sometimes you're in a bad spot. [[03:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11397.720000000001s)]
*  You're like, oh my God, this poor guy, [[03:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11399.32s)]
*  he gotta get out, bro. [[03:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11401.480000000001s)]
*  This ain't getting better. [[03:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11403.0s)]
*  It's not always right to go for it. [[03:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11403.960000000001s)]
*  But if you know. [[03:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11405.6s)]
*  If you know, yeah. [[03:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11406.640000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[03:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11407.880000000001s)]
*  And you know, I think every one of us knows. [[03:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11408.720000000001s)]
*  Hopefully. [[03:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11411.2s)]
*  The problem is when a girl's really hot, [[03:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11412.28s)]
*  they can trick you. [[03:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11414.4s)]
*  You can think you know. [[03:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11416.04s)]
*  You're like, you're willing to like, [[03:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11417.76s)]
*  there's such, it's such, [[03:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11419.480000000001s)]
*  I don't think there's anything like it in the world [[03:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11421.16s)]
*  where it's that convincing. [[03:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11423.16s)]
*  Yeah, my girl is hot, but she also shit on the floor. [[03:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11425.08s)]
*  And I got a clear look at her. [[03:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11427.88s)]
*  I was like, nah. [[03:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11429.2s)]
*  It seems like you guys know each other for real. [[03:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11430.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11432.92s)]
*  She puts me to the brink, shitting in my pants. [[03:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11434.76s)]
*  I think for most guys, [[03:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11438.48s)]
*  a really hot woman has an insane amount of control over you. [[03:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11440.56s)]
*  It's hard to, like, most guys will never experience [[03:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11444.2s)]
*  what like a really hot woman is like just to be around [[03:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11450.039999999999s)]
*  when she's attracted to you. [[03:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11452.84s)]
*  If you took a guy, you take some like a Elizabeth Hurley [[03:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11455.04s)]
*  in her prime looking. [[03:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11459.2s)]
*  Yo, that's crazy. [[03:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11460.560000000001s)]
*  She's like top for me. [[03:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11461.400000000001s)]
*  She looks great. [[03:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11463.16s)]
*  She's 150 years old. [[03:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11464.0s)]
*  Versace pin dress. [[03:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11465.640000000001s)]
*  Bro, she still looks great. [[03:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11467.52s)]
*  Like, you know how much influence she would have [[03:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11470.28s)]
*  over the average guy? [[03:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11472.560000000001s)]
*  Like if she really did believe that she was in love with you, [[03:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11473.76s)]
*  you're like, I'm quitting my job. [[03:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11476.04s)]
*  What do I have to do? [[03:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11477.08s)]
*  Tell me what to do. [[03:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11478.44s)]
*  Tell me where to move. [[03:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11479.28s)]
*  I almost moved to fucking Boston. [[03:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11480.480000000001s)]
*  Dude. [[03:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11482.24s)]
*  But you know, the thing is, I felt this way. [[03:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11484.08s)]
*  90 days is the amount of time I realized [[03:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11487.24s)]
*  a hot woman loses my attention. [[03:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11490.8s)]
*  Only 90? [[03:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11493.36s)]
*  90 days. [[03:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11494.28s)]
*  After that, they become a regular person. [[03:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11495.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah, because I'm trying to hit it as many times as I can. [[03:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11496.76s)]
*  Over 90 and then you're out of jizz and you're like, [[03:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11499.16s)]
*  hey, who are you? [[03:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11501.24s)]
*  Yeah, 90 days of nutting. [[03:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11502.08s)]
*  I'm like, all right. [[03:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11504.92s)]
*  So what else do we have to talk about? [[03:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11508.0s)]
*  I don't have any cum left. [[03:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11511.36s)]
*  Let's develop a friendship. [[03:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11513.32s)]
*  Let's find shared interests. [[03:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11514.960000000001s)]
*  Then you need conversation. [[03:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11516.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11517.36s)]

*  Like when we go out, which is very important. [[03:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11559.0s)]
*  Like if you're a comedian and the person you're with [[03:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11561.88s)]
*  is not funny, that can be a bummer. [[03:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11565.84s)]

*  She's got great timing. [[03:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11578.24s)]
*  It's very funny. [[03:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11579.64s)]
*  She's also just like the nicest person I know. [[03:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11580.96s)]
*  Being with someone that you really love is like, [[03:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11583.88s)]
*  it changes how you interface with the world. [[03:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11587.519999999999s)]
*  And when you talk about like incels [[03:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11589.599999999999s)]
*  and you talk about like women that are single, [[03:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11591.64s)]
*  that are in their 60s and like peep, [[03:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11596.359999999999s)]
*  there's a lot of people that are in despair out there [[03:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11598.08s)]
*  because we have this connection to each other [[03:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11600.48s)]
*  that we sometimes don't recognize. [[03:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11604.6s)]
*  We sometimes don't talk about it or think about it. [[03:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11606.24s)]
*  And it's, you know, it's, [[03:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11609.039999999999s)]
*  human beings are not meant to be alone. [[03:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11612.96s)]
*  We're meant to be in a tribe of people [[03:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11615.08s)]
*  that are learning from each other [[03:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11618.32s)]
*  and communicating with each other. [[03:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11619.56s)]
*  And when people get older and they just lose, [[03:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11621.24s)]
*  like we're talking about like old hot ladies. [[03:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11623.92s)]
*  When ladies are hot and they're young, they're, [[03:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11627.0s)]
*  I mean, they're the most, they're so attractive [[03:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11630.8s)]
*  and so confusing to men. [[03:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11635.8s)]
*  Like when you're around them, like you're on drugs, [[03:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11637.36s)]
*  you're like, Jesus Christ, what am I saying? [[03:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11639.16s)]
*  You feel yourself stammering over your words. [[03:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11641.68s)]
*  You're nervous. [[03:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11644.6s)]
*  You're reaching for doors and shit, you know? [[03:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11645.52s)]
*  But then when they get older, all that goes away. [[03:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11648.2s)]
*  And that's a crazy turn of events. [[03:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11650.8s)]
*  That's a crazy turn of events [[03:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11654.44s)]
*  when you're, so much of your life in the young years [[03:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11655.84s)]
*  is about being attractive and then it goes away. [[03:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11660.12s)]
*  You know? [[03:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11665.84s)]
*  Damn, I hope that doesn't happen. [[03:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11667.8s)]
*  Like, I think we're gonna have hot robots. [[03:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11669.16s)]
*  I would love some hot robots. [[03:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11674.0s)]
*  For those people, we're gonna have hot robots. [[03:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11675.4s)]
*  Imagine if you go over to Nana's house [[03:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11677.8s)]
*  and fucking Tarzan's taking care of her. [[03:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11679.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11681.880000000001s)]
*  You open the door, there's a dude with a loin cloth. [[03:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11682.72s)]
*  Oh, nah, nah, nah, nah. [[03:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11685.2s)]
*  Sweaty, like a little slightly dirty body. [[03:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11686.04s)]
*  Yeah, that's grandma's Tarzan robot [[03:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11689.28s)]
*  that's been just gorilla fucking her. [[03:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11691.6s)]
*  See, we'll have to revisit. [[03:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11693.36s)]
*  Yo, you know what though? [[03:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11694.88s)]
*  I saw a shorty on CNN last. [[03:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11695.72s)]
*  I was randomly watching CNN and there was like a lady [[03:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11697.88s)]
*  who's like an attractive lady [[03:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11701.32s)]
*  and she's like 60 years old on CNN. [[03:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11702.96s)]
*  Some hot ladies out there that get old. [[03:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11705.52s)]
*  Rosemary something. [[03:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11706.84s)]
*  And I'm like, I mean, we can revisit this in 20 years, [[03:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11708.16s)]
*  but I feel like, I definitely can affirmatively say [[03:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11711.36s)]
*  my relationship is not built around [[03:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11717.640000000001s)]
*  how attractive wifey is, even though she is. [[03:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11720.16s)]
*  I like what you're doing here. [[03:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11723.08s)]
*  You're hedging your bets. [[03:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11724.24s)]
*  I'm hedging my bets. [[03:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11725.32s)]
*  Being smart, being smart, a disclaimer, [[03:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11726.16s)]
*  a little social disclaimer. [[03:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11728.36s)]
*  Yeah, she is attractive, but I feel I'm pretty assertive. [[03:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11729.6s)]
*  That's not the most important thing. [[03:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11732.84s)]
*  It's not the most important thing. [[03:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11734.08s)]
*  It's a big bonus, right? [[03:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11735.800000000001s)]
*  Right? [[03:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11738.84s)]
*  But she genuinely makes me better. [[03:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11739.8s)]
*  Cause I'm like, I don't listen to nobody. [[03:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11742.64s)]
*  And it's, I listen to her cause I respect her. [[03:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11744.56s)]
*  She's smarter than me. [[03:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11747.880000000001s)]
*  But two, she's one of the few people I know [[03:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11749.36s)]
*  cares about me genuinely and is not self-interested. [[03:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11752.52s)]
*  So I listen and that I get better [[03:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11756.8s)]
*  cause I don't listen to nobody. [[03:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11758.64s)]
*  Sometimes you need somebody to listen to. [[03:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11760.28s)]
*  You need someone who has your best interest [[03:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11761.92s)]
*  and someone who really does care about you. [[03:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11763.64s)]
*  Cause we all got, we can't see everything. [[03:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11765.16s)]
*  There's shit that a lot of people had said to me before, [[03:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11767.880000000001s)]
*  but I only listened to her and I'm like, damn. [[03:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11770.2s)]
*  Yeah, I hate that term partner, [[03:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11772.960000000001s)]
*  but you know, only because two people use it [[03:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11774.92s)]
*  and it's like stupid cultural sense. [[03:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11778.16s)]
*  Like this is my partner, like shut up. [[03:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11780.16s)]
*  But on the other hand, like they are like a partner. [[03:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11782.48s)]
*  Like someone who's a good husband [[03:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11785.84s)]
*  or a good wife is a life partner. [[03:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11788.08s)]
*  Yeah. It's very important. [[03:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11789.92s)]
*  I would never introduce her as a partner. [[03:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11791.16s)]
*  That's wack. That's gross. [[03:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11793.28s)]
*  Yeah, it's just wack to me. [[03:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11794.800000000001s)]
*  This is my partner. [[03:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11796.2s)]
*  Okay, we're never being friends. [[03:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11797.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, like you're not, you know, [[03:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11799.52s)]
*  you're not eating it front to back [[03:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11801.2s)]
*  if you're calling them partner. [[03:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11802.960000000001s)]
*  Tim Kennedy told a story on this podcast [[03:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11805.04s)]
*  about going to Starbucks and he orders something [[03:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11806.92s)]
*  that he orders something for his wife. [[03:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11810.240000000002s)]
*  And the person, the barista corrects him and says, [[03:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11812.2s)]
*  your partner? [[03:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11815.04s)]
*  And he goes, no, my wife. [[03:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11816.560000000001s)]
*  Like, what are you talking about? [[03:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11819.84s)]
*  You can't decide what I call my wife. [[03:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11820.720000000001s)]
*  You can't change it. [[03:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11823.800000000001s)]
*  You mean your partner? [[03:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11825.8s)]
*  Like, what are you doing? [[03:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11826.8s)]
*  I'm being berated here. [[03:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11828.0s)]
*  I respect it. [[03:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11829.599999999999s)]
*  If other people, you want to do it, [[03:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11830.679999999998s)]

*  But don't come in my house and tell me. [[03:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11834.08s)]
*  That's the problem with this ideology shit [[03:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11836.72s)]
*  is like it gets in people and they think [[03:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11840.279999999999s)]
*  that they have the right to correct you [[03:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGtF4saXtP4&t=11842.199999999999s)]
