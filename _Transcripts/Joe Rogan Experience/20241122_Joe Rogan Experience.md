# Joe Rogan Experience #2233 - Scott Storch
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [November 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvKNjXawwSc)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day.
*  Those are the three I probably have most iconic.
*  So what are the, we're rolling now, so tell me what's like the most iconic beats you've created.
*  Oh, we're already rolling?
*  We're rolling.
*  Hey, fuck it.
*  Hey.
*  How you doing?
*  Hey.
*  We've got not hundreds, but thousands of songs.
*  Thousands, for sure.
*  Thousands of songs.
*  I'm told most often that most iconic or identifiable one is obviously still Dre.
*  We got...
*  Give me a little of that real quick.
*  Let's see.
*  Now if you watch my fingers while I'm playing that, if I was just like a fucking sterile,
*  like just basic motherfucker I'd be playing.
*  But I wanted to do it like sloppy.
*  Right.
*  Like that perfect imperfection.
*  Right.
*  Like you don't want, sometimes you want a nice sloppy booty or a nice fucking, you know what I'm saying?
*  You don't want things always like perfect, picture perfect.
*  Right.
*  You like a little grit on your hardwood floor.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, no.
*  That's where, you know, that perfect imperfection.
*  How did you get started?
*  Huh?
*  How did you get started making beats?
*  What started you in music?
*  What started me in music?
*  Okay.
*  All the way back?
*  All the way back.
*  All the way back.
*  Listening to like Ozzy Osbourne and Cheap Trick in a mirror with a Kenis racket thinking,
*  wow, I could probably get some girls to like me if I knew how to fucking play this shit.
*  And then my parents had like this upright piano in the house and it was a piece of furniture.
*  And I had a cassette, you know, at that time it was all about cassettes.
*  I had a little baby cassette thing.
*  I put it on the piano bench and figure out how to play all my favorite songs.
*  Just self-taught.
*  Yeah.
*  And, you know, I ended up taking three or four lessons and the guy was like, you should just teach yourself.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  Like, and my family didn't, we didn't have no money.
*  Like, and my mom to get to the piano lesson and all that shit was just, I did my thing.
*  And like it's at a point where my mom and dad were like, can you go outside and play with the kids?
*  I'm tired of hearing this shit.
*  No, no, no, no, no, no.
*  And then that evolved into I moved with my father.
*  My parents had divorced.
*  My dad was a court reporter, stenographer.
*  And we moved from, I was born in New York as an infant moved to Florida.
*  But when I was 15, just turning 15, I moved to Philly.
*  With my dad.
*  And I was really getting into music.
*  I was experiencing like hip hop now in my head.
*  Like what year was this?
*  I don't even know what year it was.
*  How old are you now?
*  I'm 50.
*  Okay. Seven years different than me.
*  So yeah, okay.
*  I'm real horrible with the years, but talking early 90s.
*  Yeah.
*  Extremely early.
*  The beginning of like the big hip hop boom out of New York.
*  And when I first found a love for hip hop, it was this music that they were sampling all these like cool, like Fender Road sounds.
*  Like say Tribe Called Quest.
*  That's not one of mine, but it was that like, relax yourself girl.
*  That like native tongue, the De La Soul, all that type of shit was heavy.
*  And like, I was like, wow, the music is really great in this.
*  It was different than like, I mean, I loved NWA and I loved like, but that was like hardcore shit.
*  And then like this musical guru and jazz and all this shit was coming around.
*  So I got into that and I couldn't really afford a keyboard.
*  I'm living in Philly.
*  My dad was like, I was cutting school and going into the city from the burbs to like getting the music scene at this young age.
*  And it was like, yo, go back to school and start that shit or get the fuck out.
*  He's trying to do me a favor with tough love, but I decided to get the fuck out.
*  And now I'm like couch hopping at homies and that led to moving into the fucking hood in West Philly with this guy who was an aspiring manager that was a videographer that I met at my dad's court reporting firm.
*  Kind of like halfway against my dad's will.
*  He took me in and we started hitting the pavement, man.
*  And I joined the Roots.
*  They were called the Square Roots at that time.
*  You know, the band on Jimmy Chua, Questlove, etc.
*  And I didn't have much money and I bought what they call a Fender Rhodes.
*  This is like big keyboard, which is they're very expensive now because it's a vintage.
*  But at that time I could get that for like 200 bucks.
*  And I got the keyboard, had a couple of broken notes on it and shit.
*  And I just made my sound with that.
*  And it was just like this soulful thing.
*  And I joined the Roots and now I'm a band member.
*  You know, simultaneously I'm doing construction in Philly for Fred and I like these like shell houses that I got to live in one for a while.
*  And I got my first place.
*  I'm like living in this thing.
*  He lived across the street and kind of a nice one.
*  This is like super horrible neighborhood, but he's got almost like the whole block and like there's construction site on the first floor.
*  I had to walk up and this was like semi finished one, no electricity.
*  But he ran a cord across the street and a power strip for my electricity.
*  I ran everything on that one power strip like I had a fucking a space heater like this because it was freezing cold.
*  I had like a keyboard set up like so I could do my thing.
*  And that was just I made my existence.
*  And wow, if I had never made it, I was like, man, I'll just play at bar mitzvahs and weddings and fucking call it a day.
*  But I'd rather do that than be a court reporter or some other shit.
*  Right. And school wasn't for me.
*  Couldn't focus on anything but the music.
*  It always bums me out that there's so many people out there like that that do have they have intelligence and ability.
*  But the system just wants them to plug into normal jobs.
*  You don't realize like, hey, there's other jobs out there.
*  There's other things you can do.
*  It's not conventional.
*  The path's not clear.
*  You know, you want to get into music.
*  You really fucking love music.
*  Get into music.
*  Yeah. Get into music.
*  And nobody tells you that.
*  And they don't tell you like you don't have to be a Macalester to know that the holidays are prime time for crime.

*  Find your niche within music.
*  Maybe you can do the actual music, but you can become a promoter or you can become there's so many different fields within music that you can do.
*  If you're an expert, if you have no talent and you have no business being in music, at least be honest with yourself because we know if we're good or not.
*  Right.
*  But what makes talent?
*  Passion. It's no talent.
*  Yeah, if you're a passionate person and you love something so much, you're going to end up being good at it, I think.
*  If you're doing it to get money or something else, it's like it's questionable.
*  You just want to be cool because you like music.
*  But if you're so passionate about this shit that you're showing results and you're growing and you're seeing that you watch people's reactions.
*  I still do to this day. I'm in a studio. I'm playing some shit like I have this like weird thing where I start receiving satellite and I'm like playing and I don't even receive satellite.
*  I swear to God.
*  I'm not even there anymore.
*  I'm just like all of a sudden.
*  I'm just doing this thing. I've been doing it for 30 years and I watched the room like, oh, they like this one.
*  Okay, let's use this. You know what I mean? That's how I know if I'm moving people.
*  Receiving satellite is a great way to put it because that's what it feels like. I always say that like there's sometimes I write things. I'm like, I didn't really write that.
*  That blacked out.
*  Yeah, that's that came from somewhere. I didn't have any effort involved in this. It just came to me like a gift from the gods.
*  That's why they always called the muse, you know, because the people that were, you know, Shakespeare and those people, they really did kind of feel like it was being given to them.
*  Yeah, we all do though. Right.
*  Real. Yeah.
*  But doesn't everybody kind of say that when they're being honest, like anybody who writes anything, whether they write literature, whether they're right music comedy, whatever flows through.
*  Yes. If you have to work for it, it's contrived sort of like right somewhat like if something doesn't come.
*  I push myself. Yes, because it's technical stuff that you have to. But that initial light bulb that goes off and just right at zone.
*  Yeah, downloading satellite. And it's the thing about it is it's it's so hard to control. It's just it's it comes. It goes. It's there. It's not.
*  What's that water you're drinking? What is this? You know what?
*  It's bag water.
*  I'm going to tell you what it is. I get like inflammation. I'm playing piano, whatever. Like I sometimes get like a little bit like, OK, and this is like hydrogen water.
*  OK. And I fuck with a friend of mine, my boy, Adam, like he's like, listen, I think you should try my water.
*  He's invested in all kinds of things. And he's just he's been my best one of my best friends my whole life.
*  I've been down and out and fucking do take in, you know, both Michigan is.
*  But, you know, he has this fucking water and him and randomly enough, my boy was a big songwriter, Pooh Bear.
*  They're giving a go at this water thing. So but I like it.
*  It's H factor water, dude. Yeah, I've heard of this stuff. It's really good.
*  So when you say you're getting inflammation in your hands like carpal tunnel type.
*  Like sometimes if it's cold and my hands, it's like freezing or something.
*  I can't really like go in and like you have a UCBD.
*  You have a UCBD or turmeric.
*  I turmeric. Yeah, like I do that stuff.
*  I do like the little shots like, yeah, you should do all the time.
*  Raw ginger. Yeah.
*  Yeah. There's a place in L.A. that I like that I don't have it in my.
*  I'm real tight with I don't know if you know Rick Solomon.
*  He knows this thing, Sun Life, and fucking they have great shit there.
*  So I do that. Oh, the Sun Life place in California.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Oh, I do. Yeah.
*  Yes. Rick is fucking he's been an inspiration to me and like, you know, everybody knows my story.
*  And, you know, I look up to him because he was able to walk away from drugs.
*  Right. Very easily.
*  And stay there for me. I have a hard time with it.
*  I still struggle.
*  And like, it's not drugs.
*  It's to put it bluntly, it's pussy and drugs together.
*  OK, it's a hell of a combination and drug sex and all that shit.
*  And like, you know, you get caught up in that wave and like it starts
*  glamorously in your career of doing drugs and it's just fucking it just turns into something real ugly.
*  So it also walked away from me for a while.
*  He was like, you're fucking up again.
*  But I'm in a great place now, man.
*  I got good people around me and I smoke and, you know, I make my music and I chill these days.
*  That's great. I've graduated.
*  I was trying to tell you about your hand.
*  Like if you're getting inflammation and you take in hydrogen water, like hydrogen water would be great.
*  But if you really want to cut it down, what we were talking about earlier is the way to cut it down.
*  Stop eating things that give you inflammation.
*  That's the big one. That'll change everything.
*  Yeah. Cut out all the sugar in the bread and you'll be amazed at how well you feel.
*  Bread. Like I'm not really like a sugar guy.
*  Like some people eat sweets and shit like me.
*  I'll go lately because I'm trying to lose like my weight.
*  Lately, because I'm trying to lose like a lot of weight, I've been eating fruit like constantly eating.
*  Fruit's great.
*  And I feel so much better because like I drink water until I'm blue in the face.
*  I'm not hydrated. I eat fruits and shit like that.
*  I feel like it just sticks to your organs and like just a lot of watermelon.
*  Watermelon's fantastic.
*  I love watermelon and apples.
*  Do you take any sort of electrolytes?
*  I do. I do. I mean.
*  Regularly?
*  Gatorade.
*  I'm just trying to help you with your hands.
*  Yeah, Gatorade. But there's other stuff. I don't even know what it's called.
*  It's like a powder. It's like supposed to be less fattening.
*  And you just put it in the water and it's like an accelerator of hydration.
*  Like liquid IV or something like that?
*  Something. Yeah. I don't even know.
*  There's a bunch of those that are really good.
*  But yeah, that's, you know, you could take care of that.
*  I mean, I know your fingers are still working, but if you're starting to feel like real discomfort,
*  there's some things you could do.
*  CBD's a big one. CBD helps so much.
*  My friend Dave Foley, he had arthritis to the point where his hands were like totally cruel.
*  He couldn't straighten his hands out.
*  He started taking CBD and it all went away.
*  That's crazy. Yeah.
*  The benefits of...
*  And it's incredible. It really is incredible.
*  The diet is a big one, too.
*  I think I'm getting my fair share of CBD and THC.
*  From the queen.
*  Not just that. Not from the flower, but I like edibles, but not like Dysolate.
*  I know what you're saying.
*  I'm into rosin edibles.
*  The difference is the CBD, you can isolate just the CBD.
*  Yeah.
*  They can make it in much higher concentrates.
*  Oh, really?
*  Yeah. Like I love this shit.
*  When I have muscle soreness is a CBD.
*  I'm no affiliation.
*  CBD MD as this product called Freeze.
*  It's 3000 milligrams CBD.
*  It's a roll-on. It's a roll-on.
*  So if you have sore muscles, yeah.
*  It's fucking great. I love it.
*  But they have great gummies and oils.
*  CBD is fantastic.
*  Anytime you can eliminate inflammation in your life, that's good.
*  Whether it's your personal life or your body, just eliminate all the inflammation.
*  So many people tell me this wave of like sea moss.
*  Sea moss?
*  Yeah. Like people like the benefits of...
*  Are you hearing about sea moss, Jimmy?
*  I've heard of it.
*  Are you hearing about people eating it?
*  I don't know.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't know. I haven't tried it, but...
*  I'm a big believer in rib eyes.
*  Yeah, rib eye.
*  Medium rare.
*  I love that.
*  Little salt.
*  Butterfly with a char.
*  Yeah. I'm not really into your sea moss.
*  No. I've never tried the shit, but everybody's like, you should do sea moss.
*  Most of that shit is starvation food.
*  Really?
*  Yeah. People eat it when they couldn't find fish.
*  If you could find fish, you ate a fucking fish.
*  Why would you eat that stupid moss?
*  I think that's what most vegetables are.
*  Most vegetables are starvation food.
*  Yeah.
*  I think...
*  I fuck with salads.
*  I actually enjoy salads, but I do them.
*  I'm going to put dressing on it and shit and destroy it.
*  Right. Some ranch.
*  A little Caesar vibe.
*  I just like oil and vinegar.
*  Olive oil and vinegar is all I like on salads.
*  But I like salads. I eat salads.
*  I'm not religious about it, but I know that when I'm only eating
*  meat and steak and eggs, I feel way better.
*  Everything feels like it's in tune. My brain works better.
*  My body feels more relaxed.
*  It's a tangible thing. When I eat a lot of bullshit, I feel it.
*  I met these... coming from being a fucking middle of nowhere kid,
*  not a rich kid, not part of some socialite type shit,
*  I came up to a certain level of people that was pretty insane,
*  like Russian multi-billionaires.
*  What is that like, hanging around with those cats?
*  That's fucking bizarre.
*  That must be weird because they'll get you killed.
*  Right?
*  It could happen, yeah.
*  But I'm hanging out with this one guy who's one of the richest men in the world
*  and we're eating borscht. He's like,
*  Scotty, you should eat soup every day. It's good.
*  I know what I'm telling you.
*  I'm like, okay. I eat a lot of soup.
*  Soup's good. Soup is basically vegetable juice.
*  You're saying like the hot broth and shit like that is super good for you.
*  You live longer.
*  Bro, I used to live in Los Angeles.
*  I used to go to Jerry's Famous Deli and get their chicken noodle soup.
*  They had the best.
*  Oh my God, their chicken noodle soup.
*  No chives, though, I tell them.
*  Do they put chives in it normally?
*  Jerry's does, yeah.
*  But I like...
*  Not a chives guy?
*  I like dill.
*  Dill?
*  Dill, yeah.
*  I got like a Russian nanny and different things like that that work for me.
*  And they put that fresh dill in. Oh my God.
*  And that just changes everything.
*  That's like mama never made.
*  If you think about how cold Russia is, of course they make a good soup.
*  Anywhere that's cold is going to make a good soup.
*  You don't hear like soup from Texas.
*  No.
*  Right?
*  You hear chili.
*  You don't hear soup.
*  You don't hear about their soup.
*  Queso.
*  Queso?
*  That's kind of soup.
*  I had the butternut squash soup where you put me at last night at the Four Seasons.
*  That's not my kind of soup.
*  It was good, but it's just not my favorite.
*  It's basically vegetable juice.
*  That's where you're drinking hot vegetable juice.
*  But of course it's good for you.
*  Table cream, all of those things.
*  Right.
*  Oh, that kind of stuff where they make the little, the white swirls on the top like it's a latte.
*  Fancy.
*  Very fancy, Scott.
*  So yeah, music, we started talking about how my music career evolved.
*  Pull up to that mic.
*  So earlier we were talking about where did it start?
*  I went all the way back.
*  So now I'm hanging with this guy Richard, the videographer I was saying that I met in my dad's office.
*  He took me in, started making an attempt to professionalize myself as a musician, joined the Roots.
*  We got a record deal.
*  And I loved it.
*  I was now a very lucky guy to be involved in something cool, but I was bringing some real majors to the table within the group.
*  And I just felt like after a while I wasn't appreciated.
*  And I was just going to be remembered as the guy who played keys for the Roots.
*  And I wanted more than that.
*  I left the group for a multitude of reasons.
*  Some I usually don't talk about, but like I, you know, boohoo, I felt some reverse racism.
*  I know that people have dealt with shit, like fucked up shit.
*  But I was just like kind of mortified once I'm on a stage.
*  And I just remember I'm performing with the Roots in New York, this event called the Black Lilly,
*  and playing the keyboards, backing everybody up and this and that.
*  And somebody was rapping.
*  They pointed me. The white devil.
*  Something else just like, what the fuck is happening here?
*  Were they serious?
*  No, no, it was fucked up shit, bro.
*  It really hurt me because I'm like, I don't see color.
*  I don't see any of that shit.
*  I'm the most like just coolest motherfucker in that aspect.
*  Like to me, racism bothers me.
*  But it was like, you know, my family now were not representing for me.
*  And I let that happen and just combined with someone on the stage.
*  Yes. One of the rappers.
*  I'm not going to say names, but just it was just like, how is this happening right now?
*  And, you know, I felt like all the credit for all the like big melodies and stuff that I was creating for the group was just being swept under the rug.
*  And like I said, I got to leave this group.
*  I'm dating this girl at the time who was like urging me not to.
*  She's saying you're going to be the Pete Best of the roots.
*  You know who Pete Best is?
*  Yeah, the Beatle. He left the Beatles.
*  Yeah. So she was like, you're gonna be Pete Best of the roots.
*  I was like, that's cool.
*  She actually dumped me.
*  And I continued on my journey attempting to be a music producer and not join bands.
*  And I met this guy through the whole process of being in the roots.
*  His name was Derek Jackson.
*  And he and I, he embraced me and said, you know, you're so talented, like, let's give it a go.
*  And we would take these trips from Philly to New York and just go to every A&R, every fucking label, trying people that contacts that this guy Derek had in New York.
*  He was from New York.
*  You know, like he would just use them.
*  And then the first week we were doing that, we got a couple of bites.
*  And one was my first client was Busta Rhymes.
*  Wow.
*  Who's I'll never forget it.
*  Busta like believed me.
*  He's like, all right.
*  And I went to the studio.
*  We made a record.
*  One shot, one kill, baby.
*  That's how it is.
*  Like you get one shot.
*  You know, it's not like and we made Blot Out, which was on his album Anarchy.
*  And we also got that same week, maybe three days later, Capone and Noriega and CNN album, you know, Norie's got his like, his like, you know, his whole world in podcasts now.
*  So he's proud of that guy.
*  Great guy.
*  But they believed in me.
*  And the day I went in, I'll never forget it.
*  Capone, whose partner was coming home from jail that day.
*  And the theme of the day was, I guess he got him some girls and like, like on the way to the studio to come work.
*  And now he's like all day, he kept saying, it's nothing.
*  It's nothing to come home from jail with these girls in your limousine and come work with me and Scotty and this and that.
*  It was just amazing day.
*  We made music.
*  We made like three.
*  And then I was off to the races, man.
*  I was making music.
*  Wow.
*  And a whole bunch of cool stuff in between there and then still ain't make no money.
*  But I'm now like doing shit.
*  Is that you?
*  Yeah, let me shut this off.
*  Isn't it funny that that fear of like the Pete Best type thing that's such a real thing in the beginning?
*  You don't have any idea what your future is going to be like, did I?
*  I would see shit on.
*  Yeah, like they're appearing here.
*  They're doing this and that would be like, fuck.
*  But what did I do?
*  Right.
*  I held in there.
*  And then I'm always a lot of people say this, but I'm a fucking very harmonious person.
*  I always do good for everybody.
*  I never like you can accuse me of being a lot of things, but being an asshole or not.
*  So when I was in my first trip to L.A., all right, I went to L.A.
*  to perform and I did this this open mic at the Martini Lounge was my first time ever going to California.
*  And it was like it was a roots event.
*  I wasn't in the group anymore.
*  But like whatever I had to do, I was going to make a few hundred bucks to go play background on this on this thing.
*  It wasn't the roots.
*  It was like an open mic with Pete random people coming.
*  OK, so I did this thing and who do I see come up to me?
*  But a chick I knew from Philly and she was like storage.
*  So she's like, you're not going to believe this, but I signed a record deal with Dr. Dre and aftermath.
*  That's like, wow, that's crazy.
*  So she's like, I'm going to hook you up with Dre.
*  You're always fucking good to me in Philly and you never tried to smash.
*  You let me go in the studio and we did cool stuff together.
*  And like it was a platonic thing like she was my homegirl.
*  And sure enough, I go and I meet up with Dre.
*  I'm waiting for him to come out.
*  I'm in the lobby like nervous as hell.
*  I don't have anything to play for him.
*  I have my fingers. That's about it.
*  And I go into a room and he sits me down.
*  He's like, I heard you good at them keys.
*  I start playing for him and this and that.
*  He's real quiet and just like listening.
*  Nothing's coming from this.
*  I'm going to go home sad today.
*  He leaves the room.
*  I'm still sitting in there.
*  I'm like, I don't know if I should be just leaving or I'm supposed to stay in here.
*  And this dude, Larry Chapman, is like one of his like head dudes comes back.
*  Dre wants you to stay here for a long time.
*  You can get your hotel and here's some money.
*  It was like, really?
*  Okay.
*  Dre wants you to stay here for a long time.
*  Yeah.
*  Let me know Dre wants you here, man.
*  Like you can stay because I was going to get on a plane back to Philly that night.
*  And I remember I went back to the hotel.
*  I got all my shit.
*  Now I'm being switched to like a fancy hotel and I'm like chilling and I got some money.
*  I went and rented a fucking five series VMW and I was like, wow, I am in LA.
*  For the first time I have money.
*  I just met Dre.
*  I'm about to make a fucking album with Dr. Dre.
*  The next day I go to the studio.
*  I meet up with Dre and he's telling me all kinds of cool shit, man.
*  Like he accepted me into his world.
*  Like it was like such a, it was surreal, bro.
*  It's a movie scene.
*  It was surreal.
*  Dre wants you to stay for a long time.
*  I got this, he's telling me I got this rapper that is really talented.
*  I believe in him.
*  He's a white boy and this and that and in walks Eminem.
*  And like he let me finish up some record that he was doing with him.
*  It was like one of Em's first releases at Just the Two of Us.
*  You know what I'm talking about?
*  And I played a little keys on that a little bit.
*  The next day me and Dre went in to work on his project and we made Big Egos, which made it to that.
*  That's like that one shot, one kill thing.
*  Like that first day worked out.
*  It led to me being along Dre's side and in his camp for a very long time.
*  But there's just a handful of dudes like you out there in the world that I call like a musical magician.
*  You know, there's people that people call upon.
*  You know, like you got to get storage.
*  I'm a producer producer.
*  Right. But what is that?
*  Like what separates you from other musicians that makes you this savant?
*  Do you think about it or would that take away the magic?
*  I can barely tie my shoelaces.
*  But you know how to bang out some beats.
*  I got this shit.
*  Right.
*  I was telling you about that Russian oligarch.
*  OK, he looked at me one time and he says, Scottie, you're not playing this keyboard.
*  You're fucking the piano.
*  I don't know what you're doing with your.
*  It's raw.
*  I'm not an educated guy, but like I have rhythm like on some different shit like Bob James.
*  Like your boys, the black black keys like love those guys.
*  Look, not to jump around too much, but working with them is the first time I feel like I did anything good.
*  I can't explain it.
*  And while I have all these hits like the candy shop, this, that, Beyonce, every single I'd be like the first time I really got into it on some real touch the culture, real shit.
*  Not what people like trap music and dumb shit like that.
*  Yeah, this is like the real as it gets.
*  And I got to use these vintage keyboards.
*  I'm playing shit with a wah, wah pedal on a keyboard and like going crazy.
*  And like if you look at my Instagram, sometimes you'll see some of the shit that I'm doing.
*  Like their studio, I watch it all the time.
*  Their studio is insane.
*  And like those toys, like I was really tapping in.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah. It was so much fun.
*  I just love those two guys.
*  They're just and they're so fucking talented, man.
*  We saw him out here at Stubbs.
*  Yeah.
*  Fuck. It was so fun, man.
*  Yeah, man.
*  Something about Nashville is a great place to make music.
*  Well, think about how much great music has come out of there.
*  And then the memory of that shit is burned into the city.
*  I believe in that.
*  I believe that places have memory.
*  You know, I really do.
*  You feel it.
*  I think there's a there's an element.
*  I mean, it's not everything about a place, but I think places have memory.
*  You know, I think that a place like Nashville, I mean, and also it's small enough because it's because it's kind of a tight community.
*  Everybody kind of knows everybody.
*  There's so many musicians there.
*  Kid Rocks, their black keys.
*  Yeah, Kid Rock.
*  He told me he was he made.
*  Yeah, I read it with the UFC.
*  Kid Rocks, my favorite fucking thing of all time is going to his giant track of land in Nashville and seeing his fucking White House.
*  Yeah, like with the rotating dining room and the fucking crazy.
*  He's out of his mind.
*  He did well, man.
*  Yeah, he was one of I know I met him.
*  I met him.
*  He used to come up to the studio when we were making the Chronic album.
*  I think it was like it was like visiting, I think with a lot with Eminem and I don't know if he was doing some other stuff, but he was he was there quite a bit.
*  Cool guy, man.
*  Yeah, he's always at the UFC with Trump.
*  It's where because Trump comes into American badass.
*  The crowd goes nuts when they know he's there and then Kid Rocks behind them.
*  It's like the Republican Avengers.
*  Dude, I performed at Mar-a-Lago not long ago.
*  No way.
*  Yeah, I jammed out.
*  I did a Blacks for Trump thing and I it was cool, man.
*  Jeff Dye was telling me he's done stand up at Mar-a-Lago.
*  How crazy is that?
*  Yeah, that's a fucking he's a genius.
*  I really am.
*  He got a sick, sick operation over that Mar-a-Lago is insane, bro.
*  I need to check it out.
*  We thought about doing we do this podcast called Protect Our Parks with Shane Gillis, Ari Shaffir and Mark Normans.
*  Crazy part.
*  We get hammered and drink beer at like this giant Freedom Bong.
*  It's like an Eagles asshole.
*  You're drinking the beer at it.
*  And we talked about doing one from Mar-a-Lago.
*  We might do that.
*  That's cool.
*  I'm supposed to go there.
*  I think I'll go there for us on the 13th.
*  They're doing some kind of event like roaring 20s vibe dinner and then like a whole weekend of roaring 20s like it's like you wear the outfits.
*  I'm not going to put like one of them outfits.
*  What's like a roaring 20s outfit?
*  I would imagine that's like the breasted.
*  Yeah, like the Peaky Blinders.
*  What those dudes were.
*  What do they wear in the 20s?
*  The Shelby's zoot suits, man.
*  What do they wear?
*  Roaring 20s men.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  Oh, that looks slick.
*  Those hats.
*  They all wore hats.
*  And that's what you see.
*  I know shit going on.
*  Isn't that crazy that like nice hats just went away?
*  We were talking about that the other day.
*  We were watching an old school fight with Jack Johnson and every man on the street like waiting in line for the fight.
*  All the people in the audience for the fight.
*  All of them had fancy hats on.
*  Men used to just wear fancy hats.
*  Something happened.
*  Fancy hats just fell apart.
*  Like if you were in the fancy hat business in 1920, be like, bro, we got it forever.
*  Fancy hats ain't going away.
*  But fancy hats completely fucking what if you were a couple of companies, a friend of mine was wearing a hat.
*  You know, this hat is like four grand.
*  I'm like, it's like some fancy company.
*  I'm sure this company's but it's not like they everybody's like baseball hats.
*  Everybody buys baseball hats, you know, but fancy hats.
*  They just went away.
*  If you would ask those fancy hat people, do you think one day the president will be wearing a baseball hat or a fancy hat?
*  They'd be like a fancy hat.
*  He's the fucking president.
*  Nope.
*  Make America great again.
*  Baseball with a suit on.
*  That's crazy.
*  You know what?
*  Fancy hats just fell out of style.
*  Yeah, I think you can't bring it back either.
*  It's become a much more casual world, I believe.
*  And it's like, I mean, sometimes I always bitch like, ah, people knew how to dress.
*  When we used to go out, I would put on a sport coat and wear, you know, but like at the end of the day, like, I get it.
*  It's all bullshit.
*  It's nice to dress up sometimes.
*  Sometimes it's a pain in the ass.
*  Yeah, it's a pain in the ass.
*  Lately, I've just been changing my whole fashion ways.
*  Like a friend of mine said something.
*  He's like, even though I have nice things, he's like, you don't need a Ferrari.
*  Be the Ferrari.
*  When you walk in a room, there's a fucking, you're on South Beach and all these fucking guys that barely have a pot to piss in are getting out of the Lambo and the fucking valet and iced out and shit.
*  Like, I'm the king of that shit.
*  I was filthy rich and did all that shit.
*  And I might as well just landed a fucking spaceship on top of the club.
*  Like I was doing everything.
*  But lately I just it turns me off.
*  I look at myself.
*  I look like I feel like a poser.
*  I feel like the richest guy in the room is wearing a fucking a fucking bare bones, no diamonds type shit like.
*  Well, look at Elon Musk.
*  Yeah, dude wears Occupy Mars t-shirts.
*  Doesn't even know watch.
*  Yep.
*  You know, it's just hanging.
*  That's where I'm at.
*  I think what happens is in the beginning, you want everybody to know you're doing well.
*  So you have all your stuff on.
*  You dress real nice.
*  You know, like, wow, Scott's looks good.
*  He looks sharp.
*  But then when you're undeniable, you reach a point in your life where you just like, what am I?
*  Who am I doing this for?
*  This is stupid.
*  If you're like me and you have a point in your life where you had a hundred million dollars and you were trying to impress everybody and you fucking didn't have any respect for buddy like my financial manager walked away from me back in the day.
*  You're unmanageable.
*  Why are you going crazy?
*  Going out spending so much money.
*  But look, you're still here.
*  Yeah.
*  I had fun. I had a good time.
*  But when you lose everything, you want to like fake it and be like, oh, no, I still got it.
*  And like, I'm the guy with the most obnoxious set of diamonds.
*  They're broken shit because I just wanted to look the part.
*  My ego wouldn't let me let go of that shit.
*  That's a negative feedback loop because that doesn't feed into art either.
*  It's the opposite.
*  It doesn't. I had to get rid of all of that.
*  I had to like really take it back to nothing.
*  Like I don't care about labels and shit.
*  I like nice things.
*  Look, not I don't like have to do the pull up on the club.
*  But look, there's nothing wrong with a fucking 9-11.
*  Like it's just a great car.
*  Like, yeah, there was amazing engineering.
*  Yeah, I do it for me now.
*  Like whatever I do.
*  And I'm just like, I'm really getting into my music.
*  I'm getting into a lot of things.
*  I appreciate both things.
*  I appreciate people who dress real nice and I appreciate people who don't give a fuck.
*  I think there's a place for every happy medium.
*  Yeah. And then the stuff stuff is not life.
*  Life is not your stuff.
*  But some stuff is fucking cool.
*  Hell yeah.
*  Like, Cat Williams when he was here, he wasn't even living here or staying here.
*  And somehow or another, he got an electric Rolls Royce.
*  So he's here.
*  He's here for a day to do a show.
*  And wasn't he doing a show somewhere else or something like an arena somewhere?
*  But one of the things he said, he said, when you're sitting in this car, you know where you spent your money.
*  Yeah.
*  Because it's like it's you go, oh, I know why this is $600,000.
*  Look how fucking amazing this thing is.
*  Lights on the ceiling.
*  I love nice things.
*  I just like them for different reasons.
*  Right. You don't like them for showing off.
*  You like them because you like them because they're awesome.
*  There's nothing wrong with luxury.
*  Yes.
*  There's nothing wrong with luxury.
*  If you work hard.
*  The problem is you trying to show everybody your luxury instead of just enjoying it.
*  Like, look at my car.
*  Or prioritizing it before your children or before anything.
*  Before anything.
*  Before anything.
*  Before food.
*  It shouldn't come before anything.
*  It should be just a fun thing.
*  And when you get to a level of success that you're at, if you don't figure that out, that's when it's the saddest.
*  When someone makes a ton of money and doesn't go, oh, it's not about the things.
*  It's about the relationships that I have.
*  It's about my friends.
*  It's about my loved ones.
*  My family.
*  It's about the people that I work with.
*  It's about everybody having a good time.
*  It's about let's all get together and break bread and eat and hug each other and tell each other we love each other and do great work and have a good time and just enjoy this life experience.
*  That's the thing.
*  That's the thing.
*  The car is just like, look, that's cool, dude.
*  It's icing.
*  Yeah. If you pull up in a cool car and check it out, what do you got?
*  That is all some people have to offer in their life.
*  And they think that that is great.
*  Well, you know, the problem is that's seemingly the most unattainable thing.
*  When you're broke and you see some guy pulls up in a brand new 911, you're like, what the fuck?
*  This is yours.
*  It's mind blowing.
*  I had Bugatti's and all kinds of shit.
*  I had everything.
*  I won for the best car collection on fucking MTV Cribs.
*  I had like 26 cars, bro.
*  If you name it, I had like 10 million dollar cars.
*  Wow.
*  Like crazy shit.
*  Like I'm an idiot.
*  But at any rate.
*  Yeah. But those are fun, too.
*  If you can afford it.
*  No. Yeah.
*  But I lived a billionaire's life as a millionaire.
*  I had a hundred million.
*  I thought I said a hundred billion in my account.
*  I thought there was an extra zero.
*  But recently I met a guy.
*  He just met Kevin.
*  Kevin is a fucking like just a great person.
*  I had met him years and years ago.
*  He was the head of security for 50 Cent.
*  And when he brought 50 to my house to do the candy shop.
*  Okay.
*  And that's where I met him.
*  But I lost touch with him for so many years.
*  And just not so long ago just remat him at the studio.
*  This guy, BB at Circle House said, yo, I got you.
*  This guy wants to.
*  You've met him before, but he wants to meet you.
*  He's now the owner of the Platinum Security Group, which is like one of the largest
*  corporate security companies in the nation.
*  Like as guy owns so much real estate, he owns half a Boca Raton.
*  He's like a major freaking guy.
*  And he like we started.
*  He wanted to initially hire me to do some music for some artists.
*  And he had a record label.
*  And we ended up partnering on that record label and partnering on these different type things that were, you know,
*  different projects and shit that we're doing.
*  And he is like, yo, first of all, you need to get the fuck out of Miami.
*  I want you to move an hour north to Boca so you can focus and really make the music.
*  You're not worrying about because Miami like start slipping into my old ways and girls are every day.
*  It's show up and it's a cesspool, bro.
*  And it's so much fun.
*  And it's so fucked up.
*  And there's so much as there's so much drugs and there's so much everything.
*  And it's like, fuck that.
*  You should have to have a passport to go to Miami.
*  That is not America.
*  That's a new thing.
*  That's a new thing.
*  Miami is wild.
*  It's good to go there.
*  You need to fucking be there.
*  But the energy in that hour down the road is beautiful waterfront living.
*  Right.
*  And just far enough to where the garbage is not going to like hit you every day.
*  You can get there if you want.
*  But yeah, you're outside.
*  That's what he's like.
*  He's like from the outside.
*  Move up here.
*  Since I did that, that's why I lead.
*  So many great things are happening.
*  Yeah.
*  Even just like unlocking.
*  You know how you block your blessings?
*  Like I was blocking my blessings and now they're starting to come.
*  I'm here with you talking and telling my story and like things like that are happening.
*  Great things.
*  I have an artist that I'm working on.
*  I have my album.
*  I decided like, you know, Khaled makes an album.
*  He's got all these different people.
*  I'm like, you know, I'm going to like I've made my whole life of this making hit records for labels and for their artists.
*  Why not develop artists and do my own album and use some of those artists for my projects?
*  And yeah, I'm putting out a slew of singles.
*  This girl, Abby Stare, that Kevin introduced me to is like so amazing.
*  I think there might be a picture somewhere that I was told like because I'm using her for my single, for my first single, even though, you know, we're going to be developing her album.
*  And but I'm doing my single featuring her and then a whole bunch of other ones that I'm going to be putting out.
*  I have one with Young Blue and I have tons of singles.
*  But we have this song and yeah, I'm excited, man.
*  Like I'm doing the things I always wanted to do.
*  I'm taking like full on initiative now.
*  And you think moving an hour outside Miami was a big part of that?
*  I think yeah, in order to like just balance.
*  Yeah, balance. You need balance, man.
*  You need to be able to go hard, but you need to be able to recover, relax and focus.
*  You need privacy.
*  You need solitude so you could think everybody needs that.
*  You need balance in your life.
*  If you don't, you just go you lean in one direction.
*  You want it's like it's like your body.
*  You only work out your biceps.
*  You're fucking your hips are going to go.
*  Something's going to go wrong.
*  You're going to fuck your body up with imbalance.
*  You're going to fuck your life up with imbalance.
*  Everything needs some sort of a balance and everybody's balance is different.
*  You know, for a guy like you who goes hard, you probably should get the fuck out of Miami.
*  He's probably should be living in Boca.
*  Right.
*  All the quiet people.
*  Yep.
*  And I'm loving it.
*  If I need to go to Miami, I'm one hour.
*  One hour.
*  Fuck it.
*  How hard is that?
*  I love Florida.
*  This is a fucking crazy ass place.
*  It is a crazy ass place filled with reptiles.
*  Yeah.
*  And they literally were walking around on your dock.
*  There's so many things.
*  Iguanas like giant iguanas falling out of trees when it gets cold out.
*  It's funny.
*  It's just such a fucked up place.
*  But it's so fun.
*  There's so many good things.
*  And during the pandemic, I think people started to really appreciate Florida.
*  Like so many people move down there.
*  They're like, hey, you can just just live here.
*  You don't have to just be under the tyrannical control of the government.
*  Look, the Northeast was a great place as a young guy to build strength and the changing of the season.
*  Scraping the ice off your fucking windshield and just learning about being a man.
*  Wearing Timberland boots because you're fucking freezing cold.
*  Right.
*  And I think every young person should have to like experience that.
*  100%.
*  Not just like sunshine.
*  Bro.
*  I grew up in Boston.
*  Yeah.
*  And, you know, it's cold as fuck in the winter.
*  When I was a kid, we made money by shoveling snow.
*  And that, you know, that's back breaking fucking work.
*  Shoveling long, steep driveways and shit for 100 bucks.
*  You know, but if you could do that and do that all the time, like you build resolve.
*  You're out there freezing.
*  Your hands are numb.
*  You know, we play outside in the snow.
*  Your fucking hands would go.
*  Now you come in, you can't feel your feet.
*  Makes you stronger.
*  It makes you stronger.
*  Scraping the ice off your windshield before you go to work.
*  Salted in the fucking the walk.
*  I feel bad for people that don't grow up in those environments because I really think it gives you a little extra edge.
*  And those changing of seasons.
*  Yeah.
*  Different feelings, different moods.
*  All my favorite comedians for the most.
*  Well, that's not true.
*  I was going to say that.
*  But then Kenison, he was from Texas.
*  Sam.
*  Yeah.
*  But that was different.
*  That dude was.
*  That's a different.
*  I always think about back to school.
*  My mind just goes right there.
*  Was he right?
*  I was there.
*  That dude is awesome.
*  Yeah, he was awesome.
*  I have an appreciation for film.
*  I have appreciation for comedians.
*  Like I like really like I grew up like I was buying like Richard Pryor albums as a kid and Eddie Murphy albums.
*  And, you know, I spent a lot of times I became good friends with Mike Epps.
*  I came a lot of comedians.
*  Comedians are tortured souls.
*  You guys like I think a lot of like that whole comedy tragedy thing is like very serious.
*  Well, there's some many.
*  Yeah, there's something to that.
*  But it's you just got to figure out how to balance it like we were talking about before.
*  For me, I balance it out with exercise, exercise and saunas and cold plunges and yoga and shit like that.
*  That's how I balance it out.
*  That's I keep my mind straight.
*  But if I didn't, I would be spiraling just like all of them.
*  I think you you need something in your life that's more difficult than your life, something that you do that you choose to do.
*  That's more difficult than regular life because then it makes regular life way more manageable.
*  Well, it's kind of cool.
*  I'm 50 and I'm like inspired like when I was in my early 20s and just like doing the music.
*  And it's like sometimes I get reminded of like the fact, you know, like when you try to like keep up, like there's a session like you're gonna have to go meet little baby at three in the morning.
*  And you're 50.
*  OK, fuck it.
*  I just do it.
*  I just have to compensate for it.
*  I could have just went for days back in the day.
*  Right.
*  Without drugs.
*  Right.
*  Like now it's like, all right, I'm going to sleep real late because I'm going to have to go at three o'clock in the morning.
*  So is that like a standard thing?
*  Like when rappers come in and want to work with you, do they generally want to work late at night?
*  Rappers?
*  Yeah.
*  Yes.
*  They all want to work late at night.
*  And my biggest problem is I know I can't always tell them that.
*  Like sometimes you should just send them CDs and shit.
*  But I know when you get in a room and you make some shit right there on the spot for somebody and you feel in their energy, that's when the best records happen.
*  Yes.
*  These dudes, like a lot of dudes are not like with it, but there's some are.
*  That's the extra magic, right?
*  Yeah.
*  I think the best artists want that.
*  The ones that aren't really artists, they just want some bullshit to rap on, some more bullshit.
*  But it's there's something you're exchanging something as human beings.
*  Right.
*  You're with that person.
*  You're experiencing them.
*  They're experiencing you.
*  The music, the song, everything together, the lyrics.
*  There's that's a human experience.
*  That's why I like I refuse to do Zoom podcasts like some people in other countries.
*  They wanted to be on a screen and just sit in the living room.
*  You got to fly here, bro.
*  You got to be in the room.
*  I'll give you a perfect example.
*  I got a call a week ago, FaceTime, and it was J. Cole seen on my phone.
*  And like I was chilling like I was like, oh shit, J. Cole.
*  And my neighbor thinks I'm selling dope.
*  He says, he says, he says, yo, Storch, I figured out a way and I can harness that Storch thing.
*  You're in Florida.
*  I'm flying there.
*  So I'm going home from this tomorrow.
*  He's going to be there the next day.
*  We're going to be working at a hit factory.
*  But he gets it like we were just listening to neighbors in the green room last night.
*  We're all going, motherfucker.
*  I'm excited.
*  I'm excited.
*  I'm excited when somebody wants to get in the room and they have an idea of like what they feel like out of the Scott Storch bag of tricks.
*  Like they want to like harness or encompass.
*  Well, you're also a guy that like you find out you're working with Scott Storch that day.
*  Everybody gets fired up.
*  So there's like a feat because you've had so much success that there's this like excitement about you and you're in the room and that creates like additional inspiration.
*  I know I get my all all clients because if somebody is going to be in a room when I'm not there and they're like this is the one Scott Storch did that shit had better.
*  If I like the artist or I don't like whatever the hell it is, they have to be like, yo, that beat is fucking flames.
*  Like so I give my all to shit.
*  And for some reason, man, like I said, like I just this is one of the few things I can just do over and over again.
*  I do it good.
*  I give results.
*  Nothing always sounds the same.
*  If somehow I managed to pull it off and it's like I just remember Dr.
*  Dre telling me, yo, because his work ethic is crazy.
*  He says, you don't have to be on every day, just most days.
*  Mm hmm.
*  Stuck with me.
*  And I was like, yeah, man, like, you know, you got to be known for being the guy that hit home runs almost every time, not every time, but almost every time.
*  But when you're dealing with something that involves creativity, you can't be every day.
*  It's not possible.
*  You're asking too much of the muse.
*  Yeah.
*  But that's also the problem with like being a workaholic.
*  You're going hard all the time.
*  You're constantly working and you're going to have your hits and you're going to have your misses.
*  And that's just a part of the process.
*  I go hard with everything that I do, whether it be a bad thing or a good thing.
*  Yeah, like most people do.
*  I got like, you know, the same energy I give to that, to the music and shit.
*  I was given to like the wrong things for a while.
*  A good friend of mine, we were talking about a buddy of ours that died.
*  He died from pills and he was super clean.
*  He was a professional pool player, like a really like world class pool player, super clean, never did anything, never drank, never smoked, got in a car accident, fucked his back up, started getting on pills and pain pills to him.
*  He chased pain pills the way he chased being the best in the world at pool.
*  The same thing that got him to be a wizard at playing pool, that same obsession, that same obsession got wrapped up in the pills and he died.
*  He died young.
*  And we were talking about him like that is what it is.
*  That's that's where obsession and addiction cross paths.
*  One can serve you, one can ruin you.
*  And they're they're the same energy.
*  It's just how you channel the fire.
*  You can channel the fire to wood and cook your food or you can channel it to your house and now you're fucked.
*  Like where do you put the fire?
*  How do you how do you direct it?
*  And if you direct it the right way, you can have an amazing life and do all kinds of cool shit and have a great time and meet cool people and have a fun life.
*  Or you can do it the wrong way and just be on skid row.
*  Yeah.
*  Covered in scabs.
*  It's hard to balance sometimes things that are take over your soul like pills and shit.
*  Later on, I'll talk to you about I got into like the business of rehab, not for money.
*  I got into the business of rehab to help people.
*  But but that's later.
*  Honestly, like I got my whole life was just all music, music, music.
*  I loved music.
*  I loved going in my fucking car and just listening to the things I love, like music.
*  I love music of the 70s and I love Marvin Gaye.
*  I like all this fucking.
*  I love Marvin.
*  I love incredible music.
*  Earth went in fires and this that like I just that's where it all comes from.
*  So I based my music on the past 50 years of music, 100 years of music.
*  And I was doing good.
*  I smoked pounds of weed, made my music, lived a very healthy life and became very rich.
*  And I was in a bubble for so long that one day I'm living in a house that
*  Ivanka Trump recently just bought my house on Indian Creek Island, OK, which I owned outright.
*  I bought the fucking house for cash from the widow of the founder of Southern Wine and Spirits.
*  And I bought this house, fucking massive topiary gardens and incredible thing.
*  I was living a healthy life and I wasn't in my mind like cool.
*  But I was like happy.
*  I was cool.
*  I was cool.
*  That was as cool as it gets because I was balanced and healthy and doing what I love to do.
*  But I felt like I was yearning for some something bad or I don't know what I was yearning for.
*  But this girl ended up showing up at my doorstep.
*  Very famous girl.
*  And look, I'm not playing the game, the blame game or anything, but it's just a course of events happen.
*  Paris Hilton shows up at my door initially to work on music and we ended up connecting.
*  And I learned this whole new way of life, like with paparazzi's and being like next to her and then, excuse me,
*  inevitably hooking up with her.
*  And we're now an item and shit.
*  And we're, you know, kind of like we're having tons of fun.
*  We're good friends.
*  But I think we're both using each other in a certain way, like where I'm like so excited to be next to this girl who's like the coolest,
*  most famous girl in the world.
*  She's like my girl.
*  And like she's next to a few her passions at that time music.
*  And she was like next to me who I'm the number one music producer in the world time.
*  And it went on and then inevitably the nightlife led to fucking cocaine.
*  And she don't lie.
*  She don't lie.
*  First year, year and a half going here on planes and San Tropez and St.
*  And then it just goes bad.
*  And then it's just like you have relations.
*  I've you seen the movie blow.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  You seen how hot Penelope Cruz and do were like in the beginning into each other.
*  It just comes.
*  Of course.
*  On like there's no happy ending.
*  Your foundation gets rotted out under your.
*  Yeah.
*  And like my A list life was like, you know, was born there and like I was now like in that situation.
*  And then it ends up Kim Kardashian and all these different things.
*  And like she wasn't even famous at that point.
*  But like, you know, she's cool, man.
*  She's always been a great person.
*  I gained a lot of respect for her when she started working for criminal and prison reform.
*  Yeah, that's just shows like she's that sits on the heart.
*  Advocacy for people that are wrongfully accused.
*  Yeah, man.
*  She's done a lot of good things.
*  She's that lady's gotten a lot of people out of jail.
*  Yeah.
*  I look as long as I've known Kim, she's never been anything but just a super sweet person.
*  And that's awesome.
*  I met her before the fame.
*  Like we dated before the fame.
*  And, you know, I just I was a hot mess.
*  Like I was the fucked up one when we were together.
*  Like I just was not focused.
*  I was just thinking about strippers and drugs and this and that.
*  It was just I was still on a high level, but I was living a fucked up life.
*  I had a session.
*  Now I'm I moved to Palm Island from Indian Creek because everything I was doing, I was trying to impress Paris.
*  And like I knew that everybody wanted to be on Star Island and Palm Island and like close to the party.
*  South Beach.
*  Right.
*  It was South Beach.
*  I didn't know that where I was living already was the big daddy.
*  Like those houses you have to be everybody's there like base.
*  So everybody's there now.
*  Like where I was, I moved to this house on Palm Island.
*  I go from a 90 foot yacht to a much bigger.
*  I take these leaps just trying to impress her and just blow her mind.
*  Even if she didn't need that.
*  But I'm trapped doing it.
*  Yeah. It was all some weird mental like thing.
*  Like I felt a lot of people get caught in that spiral when they start making money.
*  I didn't want to be famous.
*  I wanted to be the most famous.
*  I wanted to be the biggest boss, not just a boss.
*  I had to be that guy.
*  Boy.
*  And when I lost everything, it was like bad news.
*  And I had Janet Jackson at my house to do a session.
*  Pre or post nipple at the Super Bowl.
*  I don't remember.
*  I don't remember the nipples, but I remember this sweet, cool lady.
*  When I met Janet, I was told to not even like really like talk to her like more like like.
*  Talk to like somebody and like, you know, it was like it was like for real.
*  Like it was like pass your message and tell this person they're going to like relate like even in the same room.
*  It's at a point where within a few hours when you're collaborating with music just for the first few like minutes this happened.
*  And then like.
*  Do we became like homies like we was like immediate like I was like, fuck that.
*  Well, sometimes it's the handlers.
*  The handlers.
*  I've seen people that they give themselves extra importance.
*  Yeah.
*  By like saying if you want to talk to her, you have to talk to me.
*  Yeah, like, yeah.
*  You know, like creating a drool for themselves and creating like a little bit of insecurity on your part, too.
*  Like don't address Miss Jackson.
*  Right.
*  Address me.
*  Yeah.
*  Address Mrs. Jackson.
*  That's exactly.
*  And probably she might not even know about all that.
*  By the end of the day, I was like, you know, I was smoking my I was smoking my weed.
*  She was like, I was telling her about the different kinds I had in these these New York plastic jars and this and that.
*  And like just cool as hell.
*  But flash forward to now, she's coming to Palm Island to work.
*  I left her at my house for like seven or eight hours because I wanted to go to the Gold Rush and go get some blow and hang out with strippers.
*  It was just like, are you fucking serious?
*  Like, you're really going to do that?
*  Like, you don't see it at the time because out of your fucking mind, you're out of your fucking mind.
*  Out of my mind.
*  Out of my tits.
*  It's just so much.
*  When you have so much money and you have power and fame, it's like you have too much possibility.
*  Yeah, there's too many things that can entice you.
*  And if you're doing blow and going to strip clubs all the time, it's just like more titties in my face, please.
*  Let's keep doing it.
*  Let's keep partying.
*  Let's stay selfish.
*  And it's and you're not thinking about it because you're what are you saying?
*  Goodfellas. Your brain is going to mush.
*  It's imbalance.
*  True. It's imbalance.
*  It's like what we're talking about.
*  So you need a balance.
*  The A-list parties turn to B-list parties.
*  The B-list turns to C-list.
*  The C-list turns to fucking street urchins.
*  You know what I mean?
*  I've had some fucking funny moments though.
*  Like, I remember having a party.
*  It was like a Super Bowl party.
*  I had like seven or eight hundred people at my house and like everybody's like fizzling out.
*  It's now like nine in the morning, ten in the morning.
*  I think Snoop was there.
*  Mike Epps was there.
*  Different people were hanging out, lingering, chilling like family, people.
*  Now it's like friends and shit.
*  And like there's a knock on my door at like 10 a.m.
*  And it's Pamela Anderson.
*  And that shit was the funniest shit.
*  In my house living with me at that time was one of my favorite people.
*  And I knew he was upstairs like sleeping or whatever.
*  My good friend DMX.
*  God rest his soul.
*  And Pamela was showing up.
*  And I was like, yo X, yo X, check this out.
*  I was all geeked out.
*  I'm like so good.
*  I think it is so funny that I got Pamela coming to my house at 10 in the morning.
*  And he comes over the railing of my house and he's like looks over.
*  He's like Baywatch.
*  And then he just walked back away.
*  Walked back in the fucking thing.
*  Okay.
*  X was like, X was living with me, man.
*  And like it was like the blind leading the blind.
*  I'm a coke addict and he's a crack addict.
*  And I'm like trying to help him.
*  I'm like, man, you really need to get clean, man.
*  Like what the fuck is really.
*  Yeah.
*  So I'm like, yo, you need to go to rehab.
*  I'm like so I get him.
*  I convince him like to avoid like a jail sentencing for something, a charge that he had, whatever.
*  He went to rehab and like getting his shit together.
*  The place that I had gone that didn't really work for me.
*  But I had him there.
*  I really did care about him.
*  I wanted him off that shit.
*  Like whatever.
*  That was like a worse evil or a faster suicide than I was even on.
*  And he ran out of the place.
*  I got a call from him.
*  But the place was directly across the street from the hard rock in Hollywood, Florida.
*  And he's like calls me.
*  He's like, yo, what's up?
*  I'm like, how are you calling me?
*  You don't have phone privileges like that.
*  He's like, I'm across the street from the rehab at the hard rock with one of the nurses.
*  And I'm like, are you fucking kidding me?
*  I was like, yo, X, cover yourself up.
*  Come back to my house.
*  I'm going to talk to these people, get you back in.
*  And he wouldn't let him back in.
*  It was a real tough motherfucker on this place.
*  And he ended up because it was court ordered.
*  He had to go away.
*  I'm at the Montreal one morning, a couple of days later.
*  And my security is like, yo, dog, there's 50 federal agents here.
*  We like crazy shit, bro.
*  It was like I couldn't believe it.
*  I feel horrible.
*  And then you flash forward to not so long ago.
*  I was heavily involved in a rehab center in California in Studio City where we used cannabis for healing.
*  And it came to my attention that he was on his last legs.
*  X was in bad shape.
*  So I was able to make a meeting happen.
*  My partner, Steve LaBelle, if you know who Steve LaBelle is, managed Bone Thugs and Harmony and all these people, like real legend.
*  We were partners on this place.
*  And we had X come in.
*  He had emphysema.
*  He was one rock away from death.
*  You know, that kind of thing.
*  So we convinced him.
*  We put him on a private plane to Washington to do a detox.
*  He went.
*  He went through the whole detox.
*  And his plan was to leave the detox and come to our facility inpatient and do rehab.
*  He never made it back on the plane to head back.
*  And we never saw him again.
*  And like I was me trying to save a man's life.
*  I really loved man.
*  He was like such a special guy, but like such a special performer.
*  I mean, there's one of the greatest ever do it.
*  Oh, without a doubt, without a doubt, the power that that guy had in his voice.
*  It was amazing.
*  But wild people make wild shit.
*  And sometimes I'm one of them.
*  Sometimes you can't control.
*  You can't calculate.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, going back to Kinnison, I mean, I just did him.
*  I mean, he died in a car accident, but he was falling apart because it was all cocaine, cocaine and drinking.
*  And the wildest of the wilds all get caught up in that life because it's you.
*  You escape yourself.
*  It's an escape.
*  I was just the difference between enjoying yourself and an escape.
*  But now, bro, like the come down like after like because after a while, like that, like getting fucked up and going to sleep doesn't work.
*  It's like it's like now you want to go for two days, three days.
*  The way you feel at the end of that run is no good, bro.
*  It's not good.
*  It's just no good.
*  Well, you're closing in on death.
*  Yeah, that's the reality.
*  You do two days.
*  People don't like to think that.
*  But if you're up for two days, you're about four days away from death.
*  You keep that up for four days, you're going to die.
*  You'll stroke out.
*  You'll have a heart attack.
*  Something will go wrong.
*  You'll pop.
*  Something will go off.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, you're you're you'll get empathy or you'll get pneumonia.
*  You'll get something horrible because your immune system is destroyed.
*  Yeah.
*  But it's like wild people make wild shit.
*  And do you get a DMX without drugs?
*  I don't.
*  It's like you call it sex drugs and rock and roll rock star shit.
*  Whatever you want to call it.
*  No.
*  If you get those people, I don't know if you get Hendrix without acid.
*  I don't know if you get it.
*  I don't know if you get it.
*  I don't know if you get it without heroin.
*  I don't know.
*  Maybe I'm so lucky because now I finally realize and I like understand like all the things you're saying about you can die.
*  And I get it now.
*  And I'm like, I'm not doing that.
*  And like, I lived it, though, and I got to experience.
*  But the music is still fertile.
*  And like, I'm still doing my thing because a lot of those memories.
*  Oh, bro, you made it through.
*  You made it through.
*  You made it through. You're alive.
*  You're healthy.
*  You're lucky.
*  You're blessed.
*  Fucking lucky as luck is shit.
*  And it's just like that's the dance, man.
*  The dance is how much wild do you let in your life?
*  And if you don't let any in, you might be boring as fuck.
*  Your art might suck.
*  I made it out alive.
*  All my favorite artists are a little off the rails and always have been.
*  From my favorite writers to my favorite musicians.
*  I mean, so many of my favorite musicians died young.
*  Hendrix probably one of my all time favorites.
*  But like, that's a great example.
*  You know, Jim Morrison, Janis Joplin, all these people died young, man.
*  Kurt Cobain died young because they went too fucking hard, too wild, too wild out of the gate.
*  Amy Winehouse, too wild.
*  You start dealing with stuff that like it's not like you could just be an organized drug addict.
*  Like some people just have less of an addictive personality.
*  But like if you the shit just takes over.
*  Yeah, it takes over.
*  And again, if you live in that, there you go.
*  If you live in that wild life, it's like there's no one telling you to stop.
*  There's no one telling you slow down.
*  You have all the money in the world.
*  Like, what?
*  What? Who the fuck are you?
*  Why are you telling me to slow down?
*  Yeah, we're out of here.
*  I just did the Star Spangled Banner with my teeth.
*  Get the fuck off the stage.
*  You ever see him do that?
*  Ever see Hendrix do the Star Spangled Banner with his teeth?
*  Yeah, bro.
*  That motherfucker.
*  I'm told I'm one of the only guys who could play like music and smoke weed at the same time.
*  I don't know how they play music and sing at the same time.
*  I met this guy post Malone part of his business team like him and Dre London.
*  This guy, Austin Rosen.
*  Austin Rosen is a fucking awesome dude.
*  Like he owns a electric field entertainment.
*  He posts all these guys, Lou Bell.
*  They're all part of like some of the most talented and like just one of the coolest things going on in music for these guys.
*  So I wanted to make a life story like biopic.
*  I was going to do something.
*  I had one idea I was going to do.
*  And then he was like, Austin says, dude, I want you to go meet this guy.
*  His name's Charles Rovin.
*  He owns Atlas Entertainment.
*  I don't know if you're familiar with Atlas, but they made like one of the biggest movie producers in the history of movies.
*  He did like Suicide Squad, that whole series, Dark Knight, Oppenheimer, like some of the craziest movies.
*  The list just goes on.
*  I'm like, oh shit, this guy makes blockbusters.
*  He was going to make my movie.
*  I was like, listen, just go meet him.
*  See what happens.
*  I meet the guy and I go in his office.
*  I'm like so nervous.
*  He says to me, I don't like you very much, especially from what I read.
*  But if I like you by the end of this meeting, I think we'll make a movie.
*  What does that mean?
*  I don't like you very much, especially from what I read.
*  Because like, you know, there's some fucked up shit like, you know, like a tabloid type.
*  Yeah. But a lot of it's bullshit.
*  Like, of course it is.
*  It made me look a certain way.
*  But meanwhile, me and him ended up really seeing eye to eye.
*  And I was able to articulate why a lot of these things happened.
*  There was one interview I missed because I wasn't even told about it.
*  And apparently it was rescheduled three times.
*  And then I was told about it.
*  And I unfortunately had to reschedule it.
*  Guy wrote the most horrible story about me.
*  It was the cover of a magazine.
*  And it was me covered with blood all over my face and just making me just look like fucking Hitler.
*  And, you know, it couldn't be any further from the truth.
*  Like, yeah, I made big mistakes, but I did it.
*  I was the nicest person giving.
*  I would give the shirt off my back.
*  Any person that ever stopped me in the streets to like get a picture,
*  I'm going to ask them how their day was.
*  Like, you know what I'm saying?
*  Like, I'm that guy.
*  I'm very, very thorough and very consistent.
*  Well, that doesn't sell.
*  Yeah.
*  What sells is you're the worst piece of shit of all time.
*  Oh, my God, let me read about this piece of shit.
*  So that's that's a horrible thing that journalists do for money.
*  They make these pieces where they completely distort a person's essence and they only do it for money.
*  They're just like emotional hit people.
*  Let's not talk about everything.
*  I left my footprint in the fucking world.
*  But anyway, yeah, right.
*  Let's just talk about negative things and only from a very distorted perspective.
*  Life is nuanced and it's weird.
*  Life is fucking crazy.
*  And sometimes people make mistakes, but it's not their whole being.
*  And to try to like condense a person down to like tabloid headlines, like that's the essence of the person.
*  That's crazy.
*  That's like the least compassionate, the least kind way of looking at human beings.
*  That's not how human beings are.
*  We're complicated.
*  That's why those little hit pieces, they're gross and they don't really work because people know that they know that a person is probably a lot more to this.
*  Like, why is this?
*  Why is this so negative?
*  Like, this is not a balance.
*  Yes, it's one side of that person.
*  Yeah, I'm a complex character if I was in a movie.
*  But of course, you're an artist.
*  Every artist is complex.
*  I've never met one that is a very, very raw and real.
*  Look at my life is happening now with Atlas Entertainment.
*  We're making a movie, major movie.
*  Who's going to play you?
*  It's got to be several me's because my span of my career starts.
*  I'm a kid.
*  Yeah, a kid.
*  Maybe they can CGI turn you into a kid.
*  You could play yourself.
*  They can do.
*  I didn't want to be involved in production, writing or acting.
*  I needed to be respected and real raw.
*  It's not going to make me look like the greatest guy.
*  It's not going to make me look like a bad guy.
*  It's just going to make me look like who I was.
*  Do you have any say?
*  Because one of the things that drives me nuts is when there's a movie and no one was there.
*  And you see this historical figure say some things.
*  And you're like, well, how do I?
*  He didn't really say that.
*  Some fucking writer wrote that shit.
*  This is not a real conversation.
*  I spent a lot of time with the writers.
*  This guy, Dan, is a freaking amazing, talented guy.
*  Yeah, everything is going to be cool.
*  If I have my way, I have an 18-year-old son who's literally me, who I make all of my music with.
*  This kid, Jalen, he's my son.
*  And he's like one of my best friends.
*  What's it like when Ice Cube's son played him?
*  And this kid looks just like me.
*  And at the time I was his age, acts just like me.
*  Perfect.
*  To a point where it's not even normal.
*  So I can't think of anybody better.
*  But we'll get to that.
*  I'm not saying he's the best.
*  But I would love for that to be.
*  And I think anybody could see that this kid's capable.
*  Yeah.
*  And he is me.
*  He's like, you feel me.
*  Like my mouth, everything, different fucking things.
*  Yeah.
*  But it's weird when someone's alive and someone's playing that person who's alive.
*  And you know, like, oh, that's not really Scott Storch.
*  You know what I mean?
*  It's weird.
*  It's like a movie about you.
*  And you remember when Michael Jai White played Mike Tyson?
*  Mm-hmm.
*  You know, he's like, I'm going to be the guy who's going to be playing that guy.
*  I'm going to be the guy who's going to be playing that guy.
*  I'm going to be the guy who's going to be playing that guy.
*  I'm glad he got through that fight and didn't get hurt.
*  Yeah.
*  That's what I was hoping he would knock Jake Paul out.
*  Just because he's a guy who's got a lot of experience.
*  Yeah.
*  And he's a guy who's got a lot of experience.
*  Yeah.
*  And he's a guy who's got a lot of experience.
*  Yeah.
*  And he's a guy who's got a lot of experience.
*  Yeah.
*  And he's a guy who's got a lot of experience.
*  Yeah.
*  And he's a guy who's got a lot of experience.
*  Yeah.
*  And he's a guy who's got a lot of experience.
*  Yeah.
*  And he's a guy who's got a lot of experience.
*  Yeah.
*  And he's a guy who's got a lot of experience.
*  Yeah.
*  And he's a guy who's got a lot of experience.
*  I don't have anything against Jake Paul.
*  I like Jake Paul.
*  I think what he's doing is genius.
*  I think what he's doing is like, I mean, he's got, he's making insane amounts of money.
*  He's having a great fucking time.
*  He's a legit boxer.
*  He's absolutely legit.
*  Yeah.
*  You can't hate on somebody that works that hard.
*  You cannot.
*  I would never hate on.
*  If you do, you're an idiot.
*  No, I was like, you know what?
*  This guy is fucking really driven.
*  Him and his brother, they're like driven.
*  Like it's not at all.
*  For sure.
*  Everybody starts somewhere.
*  Yeah.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  You're on Disney Channel.
*  Who cares?
*  What you do with it?
*  But the reality is Mike is 58 years old and I was worried.
*  Yeah.
*  You know, I just, I love that guy and he was a hero of mine when I was a kid.
*  So to see him, you know, 58 years old fighting, part of me was like, fuck.
*  Me and him fought a lot of the same demons and we were there for each other.
*  Like in a lot of ways, like I've, I talked to him like pretty deep conversations with
*  Mike and he actually checks on me and like, yo, you good?
*  Like, and I do the same.
*  That's great.
*  And my friend Rick, like we're all like kind of like.
*  That's beautiful.
*  Yeah.
*  Like.
*  That's beautiful.
*  He's a beautiful person.
*  He really is man.
*  For a guy who was the most terrifying fighter of all time.
*  He's a really nice guy to be around.
*  I felt like I was in the fucking movie hangover one time like, cause I was hanging out with
*  him in Vegas.
*  I remember we're cruising around in my fucking Bentley Mulsane at the time and he's like,
*  yo, let's go jam out.
*  Like we went to the Palms from my hotel to the Palms and we rented the studio there just
*  so I could play piano.
*  We're jamming out.
*  Oh wow.
*  Playing like old records and shit.
*  Oh, that's awesome.
*  I was cruising around Vegas.
*  I was like, damn, this is like fucking hangover.
*  That's awesome.
*  It's great, dude, man.
*  Vegas is a great example of a place where you have to have balance in.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like living in Miami to me.
*  You live in Vegas.
*  You should probably live in Henderson.
*  Yeah, right.
*  Or live out there.
*  Salim Dion.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  Live close to the mountains out there.
*  Like don't be right in the middle of all that.
*  Attack it from the outside.
*  That's what I did in LA.
*  When I lived in LA, I lived like an hour outside LA.
*  I never lived.
*  I lived there when I first moved there and then I slowly started moving further and further
*  away until I got about an hour outside.
*  I am not comfortable in LA anymore.
*  I used to be.
*  It's crazy.
*  I sleep with one eye open.
*  Yeah.
*  I sold my house.
*  I got rid of that fucking place in the valley.
*  I was just home invasions everywhere.
*  Yeah, it's crazy.
*  What they've done to that city in a short amount of time is shocking.
*  I never thought it would go that bad that fast.
*  It's the way it is now.
*  It's bizarre.
*  Yeah.
*  I always say that it's like a girl that used to date.
*  She was really cute, but now she does meth and she works for the cartel.
*  What happened to you?
*  The pandemic happened.
*  You just remember her from when she was so sweet and cool.
*  Well the pandemic was the reason why the government was able to fuck up that city.
*  The pandemic was just, that was their way to fuck up the city.
*  There were stacks of bricks on the street.
*  We all know where that came from.
*  Stacks of bricks that somebody left there hoping someone would throw through windows.
*  Starting riots and stuff.
*  That's some weird old shit, bro.
*  It's crazy.
*  It's spooky and scary.
*  It's spooky.
*  I don't like to go full Batman on this, but it's like there's evil villains out there
*  that are pulling the strings of the world.
*  And that's real.
*  Those fucking protests are organized, man.
*  People spend a lot of money to organize those things and then put bricks out.
*  The whole thing was designed to disrupt society.
*  Then the defund the police bullshit.
*  How anybody bought into that is so crazy.
*  Reform the police.
*  Yeah.
*  Train the police better.
*  Yeah.
*  But defund them?
*  Are you fucking crazy?
*  Let's just all not be safe.
*  Are you out of your fucking mind?
*  Do you not know the law of the jungle?
*  Do you not know the real streets?
*  Let me know when your house gets robbed.
*  You want to do the fucking shit.
*  You're not going to get a cop.
*  It's not common now.
*  I have had so many friends that completely flipped a 180 after they got robbed.
*  180.
*  They're Trump supporters now.
*  It's crazy.
*  People that were like full on liberals.
*  And then they get a gun pointed in their face and all of a sudden they're like, oh, this
*  is what we signed up for?
*  You're just letting these people out?
*  You arrest these people and let them out and then they just do it again and they get arrested?
*  What the fuck?
*  The assistant to the DA in New York just got attacked.
*  Just got by some guy who had been, see if you can find this.
*  He got robbed by some guy who had been arrested some insane amount of times since 2023.
*  I was looking at the story online.
*  I was like, this is so crazy that this person just keeps getting out and keeps robbing people
*  and then just robbed the assistant to the DA.
*  Alvin Bragg.
*  ROR'd out.
*  Suspected gang member accused of exposing himself, robbing Manhattan district.
*  Exposing himself.
*  He pulled his dick out and he robbed him.
*  Exposing himself is funny because they have exposed, go to the headline, exposing himself
*  is first.
*  The robbing part, that's second.
*  But he showed him his penis.
*  That is unbelievable.
*  Unbelievable.
*  What is wrong with this world?
*  I don't mean to laugh about it, but it's just like, it's comedy, bro.
*  It's like satire almost.
*  Brandon Samosa confronted the 38 year old victim in the hallway of her building on West
*  44th Street around 2 a.m.
*  Authorities say he grabbed the victim's purse, cell phone and bank card before exposing himself.
*  He pulled his dick out after he robbed her.
*  He robbed her first, but they put it exposing himself for the most horrible thing that he
*  did.
*  Police were able to track the phone and eventually arrest him near a hotel on West 45th Street,
*  8th Avenue on Tuesday, leading authorities to believe the suspect is a migrant.
*  Possession of drugs.
*  No, they know who the guy is, Jamie.
*  They caught the guy.
*  He's been, see if you can find a more updated version of it because he was arrested a ton
*  of times since 2023.
*  Exposing himself makes more sense now that it's a lady.
*  I thought it was a Jamie.
*  Oh, OK, right there.
*  He's been arrested six times in the last five months for similar crimes.
*  Six times.
*  When you think after five times ago, hey, maybe this guy's a real criminal.
*  We may need to lock him up.
*  Maybe we need to put him in jail.
*  Maybe he's a real criminal.
*  Nope.
*  Keep him out there.
*  There's reasons.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  That's the world we're living in now.
*  And that's L.A. and that's New York.
*  And that's a lot of places that got fucked up by incompetent people.
*  I don't know.
*  I just feel safer knowing like.
*  I feel safer knowing that Trump is in office.
*  I do too.
*  I feel great about it.
*  Like I just like what I don't feel safer is right now they're launching missiles into
*  Russia.
*  Yeah.
*  How do you how are you allowed to do that when you're on the way out?
*  Like the people don't want you be there anymore.
*  This should be like some sort of like a pause for like significant actions that could potentially
*  start World War Three.
*  Maybe that would be a good thing that we would like to avoid from a dying former president.
*  The whole thing is nuts.
*  I mean look I don't know shit about politics.
*  Zelensky says Putin is terrified.
*  Fuck you man.
*  Fuck you people.
*  You fucking people are about to start World War Three.
*  Yeah it's crazy.
*  Russia fired a missile today.
*  Yeah they fired an intercontinental ballistic missile for the first time ever.
*  It's the first time one of those has ever been used.
*  That's insanity.
*  It's fucking insanity because those intercontinental ballistic missiles can have nukes on them.
*  This one didn't.
*  But if it does the whole world changes and it changes because of the military industrial
*  complex and it changes because of the money that's going to Ukraine and it changes because
*  the outgoing president or whoever the fuck is actually running the country has decided
*  to do something fucking insane.
*  Fucking insane.
*  And we're all sitting there watching it and people are cheering it on.
*  CNN was saying like finally.
*  See what their headline was about Zelensky using, about Biden giving Zelensky the ability
*  to use long range missiles.
*  US made long range.
*  It's not like nobody knows where they came from.
*  It's not like nobody knows we've been funding this.
*  It's a proxy war.
*  The whole thing is fucking insane.
*  It's insane.
*  Come to the negotiation table.
*  Sit down.
*  Work this out.
*  Stop killing everybody.
*  US allows Ukraine to use long range missiles.
*  So what did they say?
*  Someone had said that like CNN was saying that it was a good thing, which I think is
*  how.
*  How has the left gone so far crazy that they think it's a good thing to launch missiles?
*  That's what's scary about life is like you don't want to pay attention to that shit.
*  You just want to live your life.
*  You want to just be carefree and have fun and do the thing that you're passionate about.
*  Meanwhile, the world is burning.
*  You can't do anything about it.
*  At that high level, it's like there's nothing.
*  Well we can.
*  We voted Trump in and his idea is to stop all this shit and hopefully he can do that.
*  But you know, man, fuck.
*  It's scary.
*  I feel like none of the fucking problems between the Ukraine and Russia would have been exacerbated
*  as far as they went had Trump been in office.
*  I'd like to think that.
*  I genuinely believe that he has a way of keeping the peace in a certain way and like.
*  Well as soon as he got elected, the Taliban said, let's form a truce.
*  You know, Hamas is saying, let's ceasefire.
*  Everybody is saying these things like right away.
*  China was saying we'd like to do business with America.
*  Russia was saying that like, let's fucking calm everybody down and stop being so fucking
*  tribal.
*  You're so crazy that you think that everything the left is doing is right because you're
*  on the left.
*  This is insanity.
*  And for anybody that's a left wing progressive person to think that somehow or another missiles
*  are a good thing.
*  God damn it.
*  God damn it.
*  You people are out of your fucking minds.
*  How can you think that's the answer?
*  It's never the answer.
*  This is craziness, especially with Russia.
*  God damn.
*  Yep.
*  But anyway.
*  That's the shit that keeps me up at night, man.
*  Oh, I know.
*  When I get paranoid late at night when everyone's asleep, that's the thing that gets me.
*  The world war.
*  The war just because it's happened before, man.
*  The world has been at peace before and then all of a sudden chaos.
*  And to think that that can never happen again, you're wrong.
*  It's happening right now.
*  It's just not happening here.
*  And we don't feel it here.
*  So we don't it doesn't affect our thinking process.
*  And we support things that could lead to it happening here.
*  And we don't even realize we're doing it while we're doing it.
*  As a human being, like, wouldn't you think that keeping yourself and the rest of the
*  population of the world safe is priority?
*  Number one.
*  It's priority.
*  That's number one.
*  And peace.
*  And by the way, everybody wants peace.
*  Everybody wants their children to be happy.
*  Everybody wants to be well fed and healthy.
*  Everybody wants that.
*  Just figure out a way to fucking balance it all out.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  We got 60 more days until Trump gets in or whatever it is.
*  How many days is it, Jamie?
*  But who knows?
*  Maybe once it gets in, they'll ramp it up.
*  Who knows?
*  Maybe they'll sabotage his administration.
*  That's what's even more scary.
*  People don't want him in power.
*  And the people that are in power don't want to leave power and they'll try every way they
*  can to keep it.
*  60 days from today.
*  All right.
*  All right.
*  On the news.
*  60 days.
*  Keep your fingers crossed.
*  Just hope Putin understands what's going on as well.
*  And Zelensky doesn't do anything stupid.
*  But saying that Putin's terrified.
*  God damn it.
*  It's like you're trying to tug the tail of a fucking sleeping dragon.
*  Yeah.
*  Also, Zelensky, can I get a drug test?
*  Can we just get one drug test before we send you any more money?
*  What are you doing?
*  Are you doing a lot of blow over there?
*  This is like blow like behavior.
*  I'm not responsible for him.
*  I wasn't there.
*  But you know what I'm saying?
*  This is like cocaine like behavior.
*  Putin's fucking scared.
*  Yeah.
*  Putin's terrified.
*  Jacked up.
*  We got him.
*  We got him, man.
*  We got him.
*  Like what are you talking about?
*  He has nuclear missiles, you fucking monkeys.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  It's my chance right now.
*  Jesus Christ.
*  Cause destruction.
*  Yeah.
*  Putin should not have invaded Ukraine.
*  Yes, 100 percent.
*  But don't start World War Three.
*  Like there's got to be a way to settle this.
*  There must be.
*  I got to put some of this into my music.
*  Like these feelings and like even the conversations we're having.
*  One of my best, my favorite anti-war songs is Ghetto Boys.
*  Fuck a War.
*  Bushwick Bill.
*  Willie D told me he wrote that in 40 minutes.
*  I like Ghetto Boys.
*  Love Ghetto Boys.
*  Storytellers.
*  Like Polo, Cool G rap.
*  Oh yeah, man.
*  Cockblocking.
*  Yeah.
*  Fucking I love Cool G.
*  They were the best storytellers.
*  Oh my God.
*  Scarface.
*  Yeah.
*  Cool G.
*  Street blues.
*  Yeah.
*  No, I love Cool G rap.
*  I'm on the verge of committing murder.
*  It's like a whole fucking plot.
*  He had a great flow too.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, he had a great flow.
*  Yeah.
*  Cool G rap was awesome.
*  Hip hop's different these days.
*  I heard he's like a, someone's somebody's a devout religious man now.
*  Really?
*  See if that's true.
*  I always wondered what happened to that dude.
*  That was a guy that I felt like didn't get his due like on the world stage.
*  Like people don't respect him for as good as he really was.
*  Because I would tell like some young guys about Cool G rap, but they don't even know
*  who he is.
*  And I played music in the green room.
*  You ever hear the brand new heavies?
*  Like the jazz band when they linked up with a bunch of rappers?
*  The heavy rhyme experience.
*  Have you ever heard that album?
*  Of course.
*  Cool G rap's death threat is the best track on that.
*  I played that shit in the green room with the mothership and I was like, what is this
*  man?
*  He's saying some shit.
*  He's saying some shit and it's with the brand new heavies playing the music.
*  And funky.
*  Fucking tremendous.
*  Jazz.
*  Tremendous.
*  They did a great thing with Gang Starr too.
*  They have a great song with Gang Starr too that's on that.
*  That's where I entered into my passion and love for hip hop is that era.
*  I was saying that earlier.
*  That's one of my favorite eras.
*  Nas, Illmatic, Godsong.
*  That's almost like the Sgt.
*  Pepper's rap.
*  Illmatic.
*  Yeah man.
*  Oh my god.
*  How old was he when he made that?
*  He was young.
*  Really young.
*  One love.
*  Genius.
*  How about Rewind?
*  Rewind is one of the most genius rap songs of all time.
*  It tells a story backwards.
*  Yeah.
*  Insane.
*  And it's genius.
*  And it's fun.
*  And the flow's great.
*  Mind melting shit.
*  I think Nas is my all time favorite lyricist.
*  Nas and then everybody else is like, I mean I love them all, but to me Nas is a special
*  lyricist.
*  His lyrics are special.
*  He's got so many oh moments where you listen to his music and he's like oh, oh.
*  It's not even just punch lines.
*  It's like the whole subject matters.
*  The way he describes.
*  The way he hits things.
*  He can paint a picture.
*  He paints a picture.
*  But the way he chooses his words.
*  We were listening to Get Down last night.
*  Oh my god.
*  Damn, that's good.
*  That word choice.
*  M is to me like one of the really like the greats of that.
*  Oh for sure.
*  Saying things in a different amount of syllables or a word that you wouldn't expect.
*  It's just real creative shit.
*  I love Jadakiss at style speed.
*  I think Jadakiss is like in my top tops.
*  DMX.
*  My workout music is Wu-Tang Clan.
*  Oh yeah.
*  That's my workout music.
*  Gravel Pit when you hit in the bag.
*  You know and whenever we do shows we have like a ritual.
*  Like when we're driving to the arena especially if we're getting a police escort which is
*  the craziest shit of all time.
*  You're going to do a show and you got a police escort and we always listen to Protect Your
*  Neck.
*  Like oh we got to play it.
*  Like okay here we go.
*  Let's go.
*  Protect Your Neck.
*  Let's go.
*  We're on our way to the arena.
*  And then once we get in the door I'm your boogie man.
*  Casey and the Sunshine Band.
*  I'm your boogie man.
*  Yeah like just to get everything going like let's go.
*  Casey.
*  You mentioned his name.
*  I have to do it.
*  I see him at the Hit Factory in Miami one time.
*  I was like wow fuck Casey.
*  Casey and the Sunshine Band.
*  And we meet and he's like I saw your MTV Cribs and I'm just going to tell you that I spend
*  more on my flowers and my orchids than you probably do on your cars every month.
*  I was just like what the fuck.
*  Wow what a weird flex.
*  What a weird flex.
*  I was like okay.
*  Okay cool.
*  I think you're wasting money because those flowers are going to die.
*  And I got a Bugatti.
*  So to each his own.
*  Bizarre quotes.
*  That doesn't even make any sense.
*  You're getting robbed.
*  Okay you're getting robbed.
*  Your florist is a piece of shit.
*  Hey everybody's got their own thing.
*  I know but you're getting robbed.
*  If you're spending that much money on your flowers you are getting fucking robbed sir.
*  He was making a point.
*  But that's a crazy flex.
*  It's also a weird way to introduce yourself to somebody.
*  Yeah I had just met him.
*  But isn't that one of those things where you used to be on top and you want to show everybody
*  you're still on top.
*  Just like you were talking about.
*  Like wearing the diamonds and the jewelry.
*  Go up to the guy who's hot right now and say yeah I saw your MTV Cribs and guess what.
*  My flowers are.
*  Yeah I spend more money on dirt.
*  Dude I've seen some crazy shit in my life.
*  I've had some crazy fucking moments for a fucking poor boy that came from nothing and
*  rose to like a place where it's like I've seen life on every side of like I've seen
*  life as a poor boy.
*  Seen life as making it made it blew it this that I've seen like I remember sitting in
*  St. Bards.
*  I had been invited on the boat of pretty successful very wealthy Russian people that I knew I
*  know and sitting there chilling doing my normal like just hanging thing and I see a battleship
*  pull up like an actual like fucking army or navy whatever fuck boat pull up near us.
*  It gets off the tender gets on the boat I'm on and it was Gaddafi's son.
*  Whoa.
*  Yeah.
*  Like what the fuck.
*  This is surreal.
*  And what year was this?
*  Was Gaddafi still alive?
*  Yeah I forget what year it was.
*  I think it was like 2008.
*  Okay yeah.
*  So he's probably still alive.
*  Yeah definitely still alive.
*  And he was telling me how his country is becoming much more like open minded and normal and
*  this and that.
*  And I had a keyboard and I was like jamming out playing and shit and I'm just such a fucking
*  weirdo.
*  I was like playing Hava Nagila.
*  Like just a fucking weirdo dude.
*  That was funny.
*  But I seen some shit man.
*  I seen the fucking craziest.
*  It's a great American story.
*  But that's the great American story you know.
*  Like coming from nothing chasing your dream making your dream fucking up your life along
*  the way but still alive till the story.
*  See fucking BMF out at the club all the time.
*  Like be in the club and be like these guys over there they just sent you 20 bottles of
*  Cristal and you're like okay who are they?
*  And they're like this is the fucking this is the guys.
*  I'm like okay cool thank you guys.
*  They have fucking cool shit to me every time I see them.
*  Weird.
*  I never had any drama.
*  I never had any like crazy situations happen because I think in the terms of like I was
*  providing opportunity for a lot of fucking people like trying to like make it like rappers
*  from the streets like so people were just always cool with me and like I was respectful
*  to everybody around me.
*  Did you ever have a communication with that guy who called you the white devil?
*  No.
*  That was it?
*  That was it.
*  You ever talked to him after that?
*  I knew what I had to do.
*  I had to like make my own world and like people that love me and be around those people.
*  That's a terrible way to think.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a terrible way to think that someone just because of the color of their skin even
*  though they work with you and you're cool together that you could just out that person.
*  The shit that the other side has endured over like the beginning of time it's like okay
*  so what whatever but it just hurt my feelings because it was my fam.
*  Right.
*  I thought and like I guess like I just felt like I just felt fucked up and I was like
*  you know what if anybody knows me they know that like I'm not that devil.
*  Like I'm the guy that's just loving like free spirited like open minded like non racist.
*  Right but that doesn't sell headlines buddy.
*  The white devil sells headlines.
*  The white devil gets people feeling better about themselves.
*  I moved to LA and started working in Tray's camp and I felt so much love and respect and
*  like I was I was made to feel like what I was bringing to the table and that crew was
*  like they were like identifying that shit and they were like praising me and making
*  me feel great.
*  Well you know the expression game recognizes game.
*  Yeah right.
*  Yeah that's what it is.
*  People see you and they hear you and they know they see like oh this guy's a wizard.
*  Like what's going on.
*  Okay you're staying here for a long time Scott.
*  I let a lot of people down man when I got heavy into drugs like like the Dr. Dre's of
*  the world it's like they're trying to hang in there with me like fuck bro like at some
*  point you know they got to like put me on timeout.
*  Yeah well that's probably good for you too.
*  When you disappoint people that you respect and care for.
*  That's that's like that's a real emotional rock bottom.
*  You know that's and that's sometimes people need that to course correct.
*  If everything's going great you have no reason to stop doing blow and partying all night.
*  Everything's perfect and there's a lot of people that will enable you to keep that life
*  going because they're feeding off of you.
*  Misery loves company.
*  There's that but then there's also people that like all they want to do is keep you
*  happy because they make a living off of you and so they don't want to rock the boat.
*  Right.
*  So they don't care like you're destroying yourself.
*  The truth is there's two different modes.
*  There's the guy that can make music and smokes his weed and fucking eat pizza and just like
*  a normal guy.
*  And then when I flip to that other thing that cocaine is not a drug you can really make.
*  I feel like good music on.
*  It may seem good when you're making it right.
*  Listen to the next day because any the emotions it's like a whirlwind of emotions that you
*  feel when you're in that world like you really feel like happiness sadness this that the
*  other like all these things all within 10 minutes you could have all these emotions
*  and it's no good.
*  So how are you going to stay on something that you want to make people feel a certain
*  way.
*  Right.
*  So that's I mean I've never done coke but everybody that I know does coke says you can't
*  perform on it.
*  It fucks you up.
*  You don't feel right.
*  Because you're feeling 20 different emotions inside of it.
*  And it's like you can only think about one thing when you're on it is that that's it.
*  So yeah there's no real good not recommended for anybody.
*  I don't know anybody who's got like a great coke story.
*  No maybe one night.
*  But most coke stories lead to my life fell apart.
*  No happy ending.
*  No no no there's no like coke advocates.
*  You know there's a lot of marijuana advocates.
*  They'll tell you marijuana changed my life.
*  Marijuana made me more compassionate because that's me.
*  Marijuana made me a kinder person more sensitive you know more into community more into love.
*  Nobody says that about cocaine.
*  There's no cocaine fix my life.
*  My life is kind of a mess and I started doing blow and then man it all just came together.
*  You know I realized that's what I need.
*  I was a little I think I'm a little imbalance.
*  I just need cocaine every day.
*  I remember being so perplexed.
*  I don't like throwing people under the bus so I won't say who it is.
*  But one of the most massive people in the world of technology like in the world of these
*  younger computer guys that became extremely famous like start people that started Facebook
*  and this and that all type of shit like one of those guys.
*  I'm not gonna say who but like somebody who's fucking so huge.
*  I went to visit him with some friends of mine.
*  I'm sitting at a table whacking it up and a dude's telling me that he just had a heart
*  attack a couple of nights before and then he started talking about how cocaine is one
*  of the most poorly publicized drugs in the world.
*  I was like what the fuck am I listening to?
*  Me even being onto the influence was like this is frightening.
*  This was one of those guys like one of the big big like change the world kind of people.
*  So he was telling you he just had a heart attack but cocaine is awesome.
*  Yeah.
*  And he's super smart.
*  Yeah.
*  Which is even scarier because you can convince yourself that you're right.
*  The whole world knows who this guy is.
*  Wow.
*  The whole world.
*  But you know I don't know.
*  I've had many situations where people so selfishly even knowing I'm recovering or recovered
*  or whatever the fuck you want to call it want to like have the opportunity to do something
*  pull me aside like I always wanted to do a bump with you.
*  Yeah man but no.
*  We can't do that bro.
*  When was the last time you did one?
*  Shit I mean I've fallen within the past six months but you know I got good people around
*  me now.
*  That's good.
*  And like the shame and the guilt and everything just prevents you from enjoying that and making
*  even thinking about doing it like you can't do that.
*  That's good.
*  That's good.
*  Hey man six months is great.
*  Yeah.
*  Six days is great.
*  The whole thing is just you're going to fall and if you fall get up.
*  Get up.
*  It's OK.
*  You're a human being.
*  Human beings fuck up.
*  They make mistakes.
*  Especially when you're dealing with something like addiction.
*  And most people think that can never be me.
*  That could never be.
*  I'm not like that.
*  Yeah it could definitely be you.
*  There's things that trigger it and like it's usually pussy.
*  You know what I'm saying.
*  Like you're not like you have no intention whatsoever of doing something and all of a
*  sudden it's right there in front of you.
*  There's a fucking ass naked girl and there's a pile of this and there's you had like two
*  drinks.
*  I've done it before and I could just do it this one time.
*  Yeah it will be OK.
*  Yeah it will be OK.
*  Three days later you're looking out the window like.
*  Bloodshot eyes like you got pink eye.
*  Yeah.
*  But too much too much going on now man.
*  That's kind of in the movie.
*  With my single with like my album.
*  Well it seems like you're in a good place.
*  That's great.
*  That's awesome.
*  That's awesome.
*  Well it's I think it's so important for people like you to tell your story raw and unedited
*  like you do because I think people want to see a person that's been very successful and
*  they want to have this rosy view of what their life was like.
*  People love to build you up but they love tearing you down.
*  It becomes like a and then for me like in my business it's such a desperate business.
*  If people know I'm of sound mind and like at the top of my game and I'm making some
*  fucking fire ass music that's a threat for certain people.
*  Of course.
*  So they'll block it like and they'll perpetuate the rumors and do whatever.
*  Of course.
*  To make sure that I don't get behind there.
*  There'll be like a goalie for the artists like so many huge artists they like they don't
*  want me to get with them because they know what's going to happen.
*  I'm going to make better shit.
*  People don't like when someone's talented and they don't like when someone's successful
*  because everybody compares himself to other people.
*  That's the real the real problem is the comparison is the thief of joy.
*  Is that Thoreau?
*  Is that what it was?
*  Say that.
*  I think it was Thomas Jefferson.
*  Yeah Thoreau is most men leave live lead lives of quiet desperation.
*  But comparison is the thief of joy is that's a real thing man.
*  And if you're a person that's looking at someone else's success and somehow or another wanting
*  to diminish that you're doing it to yourself whether you really realize it or not you are
*  wasting your own precious life energy on hating on a person and that will take away your gift.
*  It'll take away your creativity.
*  It'll take away your ability to be present.
*  Because they're fools.
*  That's why they do in the first place job security.
*  It's a foolish venture.
*  And even if it works even if it works you're doing yourself into because you know you're
*  a piece of shit.
*  You know that you've done that to a person you know you've distorted who that person
*  is for just because you want to feel better about your own life.
*  You want someone to falter so that you don't feel when you're comparing yourself to them
*  you don't feel inadequate.
*  And that's that's the reason it's just pettiness just human weakness.
*  And it's one of its grossest forms.
*  And it's not called out enough.
*  You know it's it's it's really it's a disgusting behavior pattern that's bad for humanity.
*  I genuinely feel joy and excitement and happiness for friends or colleagues that have success.
*  Yeah you should.
*  And it's inspiring.
*  I just see so many others that just don't like look at it like that.
*  Because they're selfish.
*  Yeah.
*  But it's haters.
*  But that's a good thing.
*  And you could say that that's selfish in a way because when you help people and when
*  you're inspired by other people's success and when you enjoy other people's success
*  you are experiencing a positive thing.
*  And that positive thing is one of the most important aspects of life.
*  Like to deny yourself that because you can't control your emotions and you can't control
*  your jealousy and your feelings and to like hate on someone.
*  You're denying yourself an opportunity to feel good.
*  And you could genuinely feel happy for everyone's success and still be successful.
*  It doesn't take away your success at all.
*  It's just a mental trap.
*  And people need to understand that trap.
*  It is insecurity.
*  But it's also a lack of understanding of how your mind works.
*  How the human mind can play little tricks on you and lay traps for you and how jealousy
*  can rear its ugly head and distort your views.
*  We fall into certain ways.
*  We fall into certain ways.
*  When I was in the fucking the limelight and now I'm like in like team Hilton and I'm
*  hanging out with certain people.
*  I'm hanging out with like some fucking like spoiled brat lucky sperm club ass fucking
*  degenerates and like basically competing with who could be the most obnoxious in the crew.
*  Like you don't see that happening until like I looked back at videos and things and I was
*  like dude what a chump.
*  I was like doing that.
*  I was like slowly but surely like turning into that.
*  Yeah.
*  Just to be like I don't know.
*  Just that's the shit that's fucked up.
*  Like you have to like really always maintain who you really are and like not get lost in
*  that shit and like live for others or try and be.
*  Did we were talking about this in the podcast the other day or was it a green room
*  conversation?
*  Someone said that.
*  Personalities are as infectious as diseases.
*  Someone was saying that like energy like people's energy is as infectious as diseases.
*  And when you're around someone that has a great personality and very positive you get
*  infected by that positive.
*  And when you're around shitheads like fucking dumb asses who just think it is stupid fucking
*  what you start thinking that way.
*  It's contagious.
*  There's something to it.
*  You got to be careful about the company we keep.
*  Oh my God.
*  This world is so polluted.
*  It's the most important thing.
*  It's the most important thing is your community right.
*  Your family your friends your community the people that you associate with.
*  And if you're associating with shitheads you're going to have a fucked up experience.
*  The less people I come in contact with for me is better.
*  Like I like being home.
*  I like going to nice restaurants.
*  I like being home.
*  I don't really like going out and fucking because all that energy rubs off on you.
*  Yeah.
*  People's karma whatever the fuck it is.
*  Yeah.
*  The anxiety everything although the weirdness of people comparing with each other.
*  Who's got the better watch who's wearing the nicer shoes like what the fuck are we doing
*  over that.
*  It's stupid.
*  That's good.
*  You're smart.
*  You're wiser.
*  Yep.
*  Takes time to figure these things out.
*  But but better late than never.
*  Yeah.
*  But you still have the art.
*  You still have the desire for the art like that through the whole thing.
*  I lost that passion that we spoke of earlier for a while and now it's back like a motherfucker.
*  Beautiful.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm in there like.
*  That's the American success story.
*  And when you rather that than at the type height of your fame but the party and the drugs
*  and the fucking chaos and falling apart it's better to just like embrace the art.
*  That's where it like.
*  If it's not real I don't want to fuck with it.
*  Right.
*  Like I'm like not going to like chase checks to work on music like I'm going to work on
*  what's great.
*  And that's how you fucking do it.
*  Right.
*  You stay in your lane and do what's you know.
*  Is there any way to play the single I got coming.
*  Sure.
*  I have it.
*  I'm going to show you this girl's 21.
*  Is there a picture that you can you know a picture.
*  It's like it's like I have a single.
*  I just have the song.
*  I can Google it or something.
*  No it's all good.
*  I'll show you.
*  But the girl is like organic like she doesn't need auto to and she's not like she's real.
*  So this is just an example.
*  Auto tune is a wild thing.
*  Yeah.
*  Abby Stare texture.
*  I mean I don't see this every day and like artists it's usually like some.
*  I feel beat.
*  I'm out clean sitting in this room.
*  Life is quiet all alone.
*  She's a writer too.
*  But I'm not there and if you cared you'd already know.
*  Cause the stories are all just for show.
*  You're finally gone but at least I have some leniency.
*  That I may feel something just because you don't.
*  And I go falling hard.
*  No it ain't for the weak.
*  So don't try this.
*  And I guess it's a funny game still.
*  It's your last last last last.
*  I guess you forgot to read the label.
*  That's your bad bad bad bad.
*  My face would die away if I go back to that place.
*  I know I know I know.
*  I'd rather fly away.
*  Ten times longer to feel the right way on my own.
*  My face would die away if I go back to that place.
*  I know I know I know.
*  I'd rather fly away.
*  Ten times longer to feel the right way on my own.
*  Mama told me.
*  If you can't live without something then you gotta give it up.
*  Can't live with it after.
*  I guess I'm the problem when it's all said and done.
*  You laughed at your fun.
*  I got the last one.
*  Something told me.
*  When you was popping shit I just knew you would never live it up.
*  Courtesy of the bad or you fucked around and found out about them.
*  But you still shy you shy.
*  You jumped off my side.
*  So what you're listening to is a girl.
*  That's amazing voice.
*  She writes that shit.
*  See the conviction.
*  You get a songwriter a big fancy songwriter to work with some girl and like
*  teach her how to have emotion.
*  It's not the same.
*  That's her.
*  She is.
*  It's a lot of Amy Winehouse vibes.
*  Yeah.
*  Amy Winehouse in that song.
*  In this fact that it's both organic.
*  Yeah.
*  No not different.
*  Not like she's copying Amy Winehouse but like that vibe of authenticity.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  She's a real 21.
*  21 damn.
*  And emotion is there that comes from.
*  And she writes all that.
*  Yeah.
*  She's like.
*  That's incredible.
*  That shit is not something like that could put that up again.
*  Jamie melody.
*  Is that available right now?
*  Can I get that?
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  I'm going to add that shit to my Spotify playlist.
*  Right.
*  I'm going to put that on the green room playlist right now.
*  On my own.
*  Yep.
*  That's going to be the first one.
*  Look I'm showcasing her.
*  That's my this is my single.
*  It's Scott Storch featuring Abby's there.
*  But she worked you know I'm part of the making of her physical her album which is
*  already has a bunch of stuff that she made on her own that she made and then stuff I've
*  did with her and 1217 records me and my partner Kevin.
*  That was amazing.
*  She's dope.
*  And you know I got some great records.
*  I got records with A-list celebrities like that.
*  You know it's not exciting to play like for me a record with somebody who has already
*  sold millions and millions of records like for my project.
*  I want to break.
*  I made a habit in my career of breaking artists and like I've like I did Chris Brown's first
*  song and I told him sitting in the studio I was going to make you a hit record today.
*  He was like 15 16 and I did that.
*  We made run it that day.
*  I've done a lot of you know when I came back into the business after my like dark period
*  of just not doing anything except doing drugs which lasted eight nine years.
*  I met Steve LaBelle and Steve not only were we partners on the rehab center but he was
*  helping me get back into the music thing and I was like yo get me a meeting with Jay Z.
*  Get me Beyonce give me all the people I made hits for.
*  It's like fuck no.
*  They're not going to work with you right now.
*  Show them what you're doing.
*  I'm going to give you the best blueprint.
*  Some people like to jump the gun.
*  Yeah.
*  He's like this artist this artist this artist this artist these are all new artists you
*  don't know who they are but if you make them fire everybody's going to look at you like
*  you're a fucking get the Heisman Trophy again.
*  You know what I'm saying.
*  Yeah.
*  One by one every single one of those artists that he put me with that were nobodies at
*  this point are all huge right now.
*  Trippie Redd A Boogie Roddy Rich Russ who's one of my favorites like I love Russ.
*  He's just like he's got something to say.
*  He's like he's the man like you got to like fuck with Russ.
*  He's a really serious artist today.
*  I've seen this guy without radio because he has a fan base a cult fan base because what
*  he does is so real without radio or any shit.
*  He's selling out arenas by himself.
*  That's amazing.
*  Yeah it's amazing.
*  He's just I love that that's happening today.
*  Yeah.
*  They've kind of taken the very serious.
*  The gatekeepers out of the equation now.
*  Yeah.
*  All something has to do is be good and get it online.
*  He released 200 songs in one year just like SoundCloud or whatever.
*  Wow.
*  200 songs in a year.
*  Yeah.
*  Holy shit.
*  You know and he just started that consistency.
*  Yeah.
*  It became an acquired taste.
*  And then so you just you love watching people make it.
*  Yeah I like being responsible for that.
*  It's more of a challenge than just being responsible for that.
*  It's more of a challenge than just I'm going to make Drake a hit.
*  You know I really want to work with Drake but I've been roadblock with Drake.
*  I know Drake loves me and my production but for whatever reason I haven't been able to
*  get in.
*  I want to get a hold of Drake and talk to him about his fight picks.
*  That motherfucker loses more money on fights.
*  I want to call him up before it's over.
*  John Jones by KO.
*  Before it's over I need to get a record off.
*  I want to get a record off with him.
*  Wasn't John Jones a 600 to 1 favorite.
*  I mean well he had it by KO it wasn't just a win but yeah.
*  Well that's what I would have said anyway.
*  I mean I would not have thought John would have.
*  I mean that's an easy bet.
*  I want to get a record off with Rihanna too.
*  I had a very uncomfortable meeting with Rihanna and I'm mortified to this day.
*  Uncomfortable because of the cocaine.
*  No.
*  What happened.
*  She was in a VIP in New York years and years ago and doing her thing or whatever and they
*  obviously people know who I am so they didn't front on me.
*  They let me up into her table.
*  This was a greenhouse.
*  And back in the day and I introduced myself and whatever and I gave her a hug and I fucking
*  got hooked on to her hoop earring.
*  My clothes got hooked on.
*  I'm like don't move don't move don't move.
*  No it was shit's gonna.
*  I almost ripped her fucking ear off accidentally.
*  That walk out of that VIP room was the most mortified most embarrassing shit I ever fucking
*  felt in my life.
*  She's cool.
*  I bet she I bet she doesn't remember that.
*  I didn't mean to get her earring.
*  I know but that's an accident.
*  You're that guy at that moment.
*  Oh no.
*  That guy.
*  So yeah it haunts me.
*  You're meeting someone you respect.
*  If I only didn't hook up with that earring.
*  You want to make a good impression and you get her ear ripped off.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Whatever life is full of surprises.
*  Yeah.
*  So is like your favorite your favorite thing seems to be breaking new people then.
*  Is it because you get to show the world new talent.
*  Is it does it remind you of you when you were getting your breaks.
*  You're helping sculpt what somebody's sound is going to be with backbone and what they
*  were they started like creating something new.
*  And I think that's a to me like my sound has always been to not have a sound and like you
*  know have like different like genetic strains of music.
*  I call them like different things that I brought to the table that nobody else was doing.
*  And then when people start doing it so much you're honored copying you and then you move
*  on to the next thing.
*  But like with artists you get to like concoct some kind of new vibe with them.
*  I did Beyonce's first solo album.
*  We made a sound.
*  We did three smashes.
*  I did three straight smashes out of three songs I did.
*  One was Baby Boy Naughty Girl and Me, Myself and I.
*  And at that point I had just moved from L.A.
*  And like I had been working with Dre for so many years and I'm looking at Dre and I'm
*  like Dre has his empire and I need to like go off and like create my empire not competing
*  but doing something different within music and not using that sound that he and I created
*  and sculpt together which was like the new wave of West Coast music.
*  I moved back to Florida to Miami where I hadn't been eons because I went from Florida as a
*  kid. I lived there until I was 15.
*  I moved to Philly with my dad and then from Philly to L.A.
*  And now I'm going from back to go start my own little world.
*  I'm now rich.
*  OK. And I go home to Florida.
*  I'm rich and I'm ready to fucking make my own little sound and create some shit.
*  Beyonce was one of the first contestants and we fucking solidified that shit and made
*  history with that album.
*  Like I remember she did the Grammys and she thanked God and then she thanked me first.
*  And I was like I have it up.
*  I'm like it was like one of the biggest honors in the world.
*  Like and like we made history and that was like that's like that's the ultimate thing
*  that I want to continue to do is like I want to do that with Abby.
*  I feel like once I get driven like that there's nothing can stop me.
*  I've improved my point.
*  That's beautiful. Scott's been great talking to you man.
*  I really appreciate it.
*  Appreciate you coming down here.
*  It's been a lot of fun.
*  Wow. We did three hours.
*  It's close like two and a half hours now.
*  It's crazy.
*  I could talk.
*  Yeah man.
*  Well you got good stories.
*  You got a good story and you have a good story.
*  Your story is a good story.
*  And like I said I think it's a it's a great story for people to hear.
*  People that's why people like biographies.
*  You know people like to find out like what was it easy for you.
*  Why am I struggling.
*  Like what is this struggle like.
*  Is it the same for everybody.
*  When you're struggling yourself you think you're alone and when you have a dream and
*  you don't know if it's going to come true you go was everybody like this.
*  Nothing great comes easy.
*  Nothing.
*  Nothing.
*  Thank you for having me.
*  My pleasure brother.
*  Pleasure to meet you.
*  Pleasure to hang with you.
*  My man.
*  Appreciate you very much.
*  Sure.
*  All right.
