**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=0.0s)]
*  Drain by day, Joe Rogan podcasts by night, all day! [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6.0s)]
*  What's happening my brother? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12.0s)]
*  I'm hanging out. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14.0s)]
*  Dude, you look fucking great. I told you that when I saw you, but I want to tell you on air. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15.0s)]
*  You look fucking great, man. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=18.0s)]
*  You said you lost 60? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=20.0s)]
*  Like 60? I was like 240 now, I'm like 185. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=21.0s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=24.0s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=25.0s)]
*  And you did it just by cutting out soda? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=26.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't drink. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=28.0s)]
*  I don't drink. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=29.0s)]
*  A lot of shows. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=30.0s)]
*  Yeah, like shows, soda. Soda's so bad. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=31.0s)]
*  It's so bad. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=34.0s)]
*  It's so bad. But it's so good. I'll have a soda. I'm a bad boy. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=35.0s)]
*  And I have a monster energy. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=38.0s)]
*  Every now and then. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=39.0s)]
*  But Celsius is so good too. Have you had one of those? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=40.0s)]
*  Yeah, I have. They're good. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=43.0s)]
*  It's so good. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=44.0s)]
*  The key to those things is just every now and then. That's the thing. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=45.0s)]
*  Every now and then you reward yourself with a Coca-Cola. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=49.0s)]
*  You're like, ah, this is nice. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=52.0s)]
*  On these hot Texas days, I've been here. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=53.0s)]
*  We did Dallas two days yesterday, back to back. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=57.0s)]
*  Yesterday and the night before. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=61.0s)]
*  I'm coming to see you tomorrow night. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=62.0s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=63.0s)]
*  I'm coming to Houston. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=64.0s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=65.0s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=66.0s)]
*  Did you buy tickets? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=67.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=68.0s)]
*  Aw, Joe, you didn't have to do that. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=69.0s)]
*  Because if you said we hooked you up, I was like, what the hell? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=71.0s)]
*  I didn't know. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=75.0s)]
*  But since you said you'd buy them, thank you so much for coming to Logan. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=76.0s)]
*  My pleasure. My pleasure. I'm excited. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=79.0s)]
*  Me too, man. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=81.0s)]
*  I'm excited, man. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=82.0s)]
*  But yeah, especially out in this heat, dude. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=83.0s)]
*  Just like, you know what? I had a great show. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=85.0s)]
*  You know what? I'm feeling a little bit naughty. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=88.0s)]
*  I'm going to have myself Coke on ice. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=90.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=93.0s)]
*  So good. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=94.0s)]
*  Reward yourself. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=95.0s)]
*  The problem is when people do it all day every day. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=96.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=98.0s)]
*  That's when it's just your body doesn't know what to do with that kind of sugar [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=99.0s)]
*  because it's so unnatural. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=102.0s)]
*  Your body never gets sugar like that in the wild. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=103.0s)]
*  You get sugar and fruit. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=106.0s)]
*  You know, when you have like a glass of sugar water, it just pouring right into your bloodstream. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=107.0s)]
*  Your body's like, what the fuck is this? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=113.0s)]
*  I like guarana. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=115.0s)]
*  Ooh, that's good stuff. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=117.0s)]
*  That is crazy stuff. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=118.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=119.0s)]
*  It's naturally caffeinated or something. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=120.0s)]
*  Yeah, the berries. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=123.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=124.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's acai. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=125.0s)]
*  That's the same thing as when you get an acai bowl. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=127.0s)]
*  That's guarana. That's the berries. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=129.0s)]
*  Man, I remember going to Brazil the first time. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=130.0s)]
*  And I was like, oh, this soda's so good. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=134.0s)]
*  And also I was like bouncing off the wall fucking like, I'm like, oh my God, dude. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=136.0s)]
*  I feel crazy right now. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=141.0s)]
*  It's delicious though. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=142.0s)]
*  It's so good. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=143.0s)]
*  What is that called? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=144.0s)]
*  Guarana? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=145.0s)]
*  What is the name of that soda? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=146.0s)]
*  And they have a sugar-free one? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=147.0s)]
*  I think that's what it's called by Antarctica. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=148.0s)]
*  Is that what it is? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=149.0s)]
*  I think it's an Antarctica brand. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=150.0s)]
*  Not from Antarctica. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=152.0s)]
*  Super legit. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=153.0s)]
*  I love the- [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=154.0s)]
*  They know how to eat over there too. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=155.0s)]
*  In Antarctica? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=156.0s)]
*  No, in Brazil. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=157.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=158.0s)]
*  Guarana, Antarctica. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=159.0s)]
*  Yeah, there it is. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=160.0s)]
*  That stuff's the shit. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=161.0s)]
*  Dude, and they give you a beer. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=162.0s)]
*  You go down to the beach and they give you a beer in this rock that's like ice cold. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=166.0s)]
*  Well, I don't know if it's a rock, but whatever it is. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=171.0s)]
*  Ceramic? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=174.0s)]
*  I don't know, but it's really cold. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=175.0s)]
*  And the beer is like the coldest beer I've ever had. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=176.0s)]
*  And it was so good. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=178.0s)]
*  On the beach. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=179.0s)]
*  It was so good. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=180.0s)]
*  They know how to party down there on the beach in Brazil. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=181.0s)]
*  It's so fun. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=183.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a great, great country. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=184.0s)]
*  We're going down there for a tour. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=186.0s)]
*  Nice. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=188.0s)]
*  So we got a lot of tours. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=189.0s)]
*  So we're doing this US tour. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=190.0s)]
*  Then we're doing seven days off. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=191.0s)]
*  Then we go to South America, I think. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=193.0s)]
*  So I'm excited. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=196.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=197.0s)]
*  Have you performed in South America before? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=198.0s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=199.0s)]
*  Rockin' Rio and stuff. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=200.0s)]
*  It's so much fun, man. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=201.0s)]
*  They love music. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=203.0s)]
*  It's so much fun. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=204.0s)]
*  It's just like there's not a piece, an ounce of hate in the whole crowd. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=206.0s)]
*  Everybody's just having such a great time. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=211.0s)]
*  And that makes me more excited. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=213.0s)]
*  Because sometimes I'll go do these shows, a lot of more corporate shows, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=216.0s)]
*  where I'm just like, hey, do you guys even really like me and know who I am? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=222.0s)]
*  But everybody there is just having so much fun. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=227.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=229.0s)]
*  The corporate ones are weird, right? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=230.0s)]
*  I have fun, but a lot of the time it's like you can't read the crowd. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=231.0s)]
*  Because everybody's, you know, I feel more like a jazz band [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=236.0s)]
*  or like a lounge band at a restaurant or something. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=242.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=244.0s)]
*  Which is weird. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=245.0s)]
*  It's weird. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=246.0s)]
*  It's weird that they want to pay that much money to have someone come. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=247.0s)]
*  And then it's just that you're a big name. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=250.0s)]
*  And it's like, look, we got Post Malone, but I'm over here talking to somebody. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=252.0s)]
*  Not paying attention. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=257.0s)]
*  And yeah, I don't know. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=258.0s)]
*  You know, people who pay to come to the show, I'm like, okay, you guys paid. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=259.0s)]
*  You guys definitely, you guys at least know who I am for sure. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=264.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=267.0s)]
*  But yeah, I'm not sure. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=268.0s)]
*  I can't read the crowd. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=271.0s)]
*  I went to my friend Dana White and he had a birthday party when he was 40 [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=272.0s)]
*  and they hired Stone Temple Pilots. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=276.0s)]
*  Sick. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=278.0s)]
*  It was sick. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=279.0s)]
*  They were sick. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=280.0s)]
*  They were, first of all, those motherfuckers performed like there was 80,000 people there. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=281.0s)]
*  Sick. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=287.0s)]
*  And it was one of those things where we had to get people to stop and pay attention. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=288.0s)]

*  you can. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=513.56s)]
*  I wonder if there is some way to do it with a certain amount of energy that we don't currently [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=514.56s)]
*  possess where you can take other metals and turn them into different metals. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=517.4s)]

*  And then they go in further and they've just been doing this for years now. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=623.76s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=627.16s)]
*  That's so cool. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=628.16s)]
*  It's fucking cool. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=629.1999999999999s)]
*  You never know what you're going to get. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=630.1999999999999s)]
*  They find dinosaurs and stuff over there? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=632.16s)]
*  Yeah, I haven't found dinosaurs. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=633.96s)]
*  It's all stuff from like 12,000 to 60,000. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=635.04s)]
*  I think it's a woolly mammoth, a dinosaur. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=637.56s)]
*  No, a woolly mammoth is an ancient elephant. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=640.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=643.28s)]
*  So it's not, how long did they exist for? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=644.4399999999999s)]
*  Did they hang out with dinosaurs? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=646.72s)]
*  No. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=648.28s)]
*  Okay, so they were never hanging out with dinos. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=649.28s)]
*  You never saw like a T-Rex or a Spinosaurus and a woolly mammoth hanging out? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=651.1999999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=655.12s)]
*  I'd like to go to that party though. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=656.12s)]
*  I think the T-Rex would have ate them all. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=657.24s)]
*  You know what I just found out? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=659.76s)]
*  This is fucking crazy. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=660.76s)]
*  Sharks are older than trees. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=662.3199999999999s)]
*  Sharks have existed before trees existed. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=665.4s)]
*  I get what? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=670.0s)]
*  Like 50 million years before trees, there were sharks. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=671.52s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=675.24s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=676.24s)]
*  So I mean, I don't know. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=677.24s)]
*  Maybe it makes sense since... [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=678.24s)]
*  Yeah, look at that. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=679.24s)]
*  Here it goes. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=681.2s)]
*  So trees... [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=682.2s)]
*  It's so weird to just talk about trees. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=683.2s)]
*  Did you hear sharks was older than trees? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=686.48s)]
*  Like they're two people. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=689.08s)]
*  So trees as we familiarly know them, a primary trunk, large height, and a crown of leaves [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=690.96s)]
*  and fronds didn't appear on the planet until the Devonian period, some 360 million years [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=697.52s)]
*  ago. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=705.52s)]
*  You might be surprised to learn that sharks are older than trees. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=706.52s)]
*  They've been around for at least 400 million years. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=708.8s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=711.28s)]
*  Yeah, that's fucking bonkers. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=712.28s)]
*  So I mean, did life come from the water? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=713.4s)]
*  Yeah, most likely. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=718.0799999999999s)]
*  So I mean, it kind of makes sense, I guess. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=719.16s)]
*  But imagine just like what shark went up onto the land and became a tree. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=721.5999999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=727.4399999999999s)]
*  Dad will think it worked that way. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=729.4399999999999s)]
*  Well, I don't know how it worked. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=730.4399999999999s)]
*  I wasn't there. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=732.0799999999999s)]
*  There must have been like some kind of amoeba or life form that slid up onto land and was [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=733.92s)]
*  like, I'm going to be a tree. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=741.5600000000001s)]
*  And then another guy is like, he can fucking be a tree. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=745.12s)]
*  I'm being this fucking massive aquatic creature that can just bite anything in half. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=747.4s)]
*  What's bizarre is when you think of the variety, just the sheer variety of life forms that [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=753.48s)]
*  exist on this planet, both plants and animals and mushrooms, which breathe air. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=758.36s)]
*  Mushrooms breathe air like we do. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=764.5600000000001s)]
*  That's pretty cool. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=766.48s)]
*  Yeah, they don't do the photosynthesis thing. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=767.48s)]
*  Well, now I feel bad. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=769.2s)]
*  They don't. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=770.2s)]
*  Well, they don't. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=771.2s)]
*  I just ate. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=772.2s)]
*  I think they want you to. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=773.2s)]
*  I have a theory. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=774.2s)]
*  He does. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=775.2s)]
*  They're trying to get in there. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=776.2s)]
*  Are they? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=777.2s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=778.2s)]
*  You should do an experiment and have a mushroom. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=779.2s)]
*  You know how they do like how trees go towards the light. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=781.96s)]
*  They end up going more towards where there's the most light. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=786.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=789.64s)]
*  If like the shroom grows towards a human, like eat me. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=790.64s)]
*  I don't think they grow towards humans, but one of the, have you ever heard of the stone [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=795.36s)]
*  dape theory? [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=799.56s)]
*  No, sir. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=800.56s)]
*  The stone dape theory is there's this guy who's this, he's an ethnobotanist and like [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=801.56s)]
*  a psychedelic guru. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=808.8s)]
*  His name is Terrence McKenna. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=810.04s)]
*  And Terrence McKenna had this theory and it coincides with, there's a lot of interesting [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=812.44s)]
*  things about it, but it's about the doubling of the human brain size. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=818.2s)]
*  Apparently, the doubling of the human brain size is the biggest mystery in the entire [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=821.5600000000001s)]
*  fossil record because it happened fairly quickly. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=826.08s)]
*  It happened over a period of like two million years. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=829.08s)]
*  I missed that boat. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=830.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=831.96s)]
*  I don't think you did, dude. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=832.96s)]
*  I don't think you did. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=833.96s)]
*  You're smart as fuck. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=834.96s)]
*  Shut the fuck up. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=835.96s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=836.96s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=837.96s)]
*  But this time period was when lower, so what happened was. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=838.96s)]
*  Climate changed and the rainforest receded into grasslands. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=843.36s)]
*  And so a lot of these hominids came out of the trees and they started experimenting [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=846.84s)]
*  with different food sources. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=851.16s)]
*  Oh, there's like a whole video about it. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=852.56s)]
*  So these mushrooms grew on cow shit. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=855.34s)]
*  So they've observed all these different primates flipping over cow patties and eating beetles [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=859.98s)]
*  and grubs on them. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=864.84s)]
*  Sure, sure. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=865.84s)]
*  And they would probably experiment with the mushrooms that grow on them. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=866.84s)]
*  And his thought was that mushrooms and low doses increase visual acuity. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=871.0400000000001s)]
*  So it makes you a better hunter. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=875.0s)]
*  It emphasizes a sense of community. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=876.6800000000001s)]
*  So it would make you have better tribal interactions. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=879.1600000000001s)]
*  That would benefit. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=883.32s)]
*  It makes people horny. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=884.32s)]
*  That would benefit breeding. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=885.5600000000001s)]
*  And then there's also like his brother, Dennis McKenna. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=887.1600000000001s)]
*  He explained it to me, but I'll fuck it up if I try to recall it. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=890.44s)]
*  But it's essentially that some of the elements that now psilocybin interacts with your mind, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=893.6800000000001s)]
*  it helps the facilitation of language. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=899.32s)]
*  And he thinks that all those things coincided with climate change. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=902.72s)]
*  So as these rainforest receded, these lower hominids came out, tried mushrooms, started [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=906.2800000000001s)]
*  eating them and kept eating them for millions of years. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=912.12s)]
*  And that was a part of the diet. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=914.7600000000001s)]
*  And as they did this and as they understood what to get and what to eat, they looked for [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=916.4200000000001s)]
*  it and they ate it all the time. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=921.44s)]
*  And it probably gave them a lot of ideas for how to make tools. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=924.2s)]
*  It probably gave them ideas like how to harness fire. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=927.8s)]
*  And he thinks it's the source of human evolution. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=931.28s)]
*  Shrooms. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=934.04s)]
*  That's amazing. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=935.04s)]
*  I believe it. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=937.0799999999999s)]
*  And they're illegal, which is hilarious. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=938.0799999999999s)]
*  Are they? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=939.0799999999999s)]
*  Imagine that? [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=940.0799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, federally. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=941.0799999999999s)]
*  I don't really leave the house. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=942.0799999999999s)]
*  They grow whether they like them or not. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=945.0s)]
*  Not that I have them there. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=946.0s)]
*  My buddy Duncan lived in Asheville, North Carolina, and they had so many shrooms that were growing [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=948.88s)]
*  that they started giving the cows a certain kind of feed to discourage the fungus growth. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=953.76s)]
*  They put chemicals in their feed to kill the fucking fungus, the most natural thing. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=960.52s)]
*  Can you get in trouble? [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=965.6s)]
*  Say you have a bunch of cattle, right? [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=968.64s)]
*  Can you get in trouble and then someone from the DEA shows up and starts flipping over [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=971.3199999999999s)]
*  your patties? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=975.12s)]
*  It would be a hard thing. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=976.12s)]
*  I mean, they'd have to really be going after you because obviously that shit just grows [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=977.12s)]
*  naturally. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=980.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=981.08s)]
*  You don't have to do anything. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=982.2s)]
*  They're everywhere. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=983.5600000000001s)]
*  They're everywhere. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=985.12s)]
*  Like Duncan said, it's like there's because the way mushrooms work is there's spores, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=986.12s)]
*  right? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=992.1600000000001s)]
*  But then there's the most of that. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=993.1600000000001s)]
*  What you see that pops out of the ground is like the fruit of the actual mushroom. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=995.6800000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1000.2800000000001s)]
*  The real mushroom is underground. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1001.2800000000001s)]
*  The real mushroom is the mycelium, the spore, all this stuff that connects all of the the [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1003.32s)]
*  vegetable life form, all the vegetation life form together. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1008.84s)]
*  Does that have psilocybin? [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1012.0s)]
*  Some of it does. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1014.2s)]
*  I think just the fruiting bodies probably do. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1016.2s)]
*  Just the ones that come out of the earth are probably the ones. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1018.72s)]
*  I don't know though. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1020.9200000000001s)]
*  I don't know that. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1022.0s)]
*  I wonder if there's like worms down there getting high as fuck or just like little critters [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1023.0s)]
*  munching on it. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1028.96s)]
*  They're probably connecting in some very weird way. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1030.76s)]
*  They get to get to the roots and just take like a big cluck and then they're like, oh [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1033.4s)]
*  my fucking god. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1036.8400000000001s)]
*  I'm so high right now. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1037.84s)]
*  Just absorbing it. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1039.76s)]
*  Absorbing it through the soil. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1040.76s)]
*  They're just absorbing it. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1042.36s)]
*  See? [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1043.9599999999998s)]
*  That's good. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1044.9599999999998s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1045.9599999999998s)]
*  Imagine it's all just in there and then like you get some like shroom corn. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1046.9599999999998s)]
*  So you can just eat like a an ear of corn and get super fucking rocked. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1051.6799999999998s)]
*  Well you know they used to accidentally get high because they would get ergot would poison [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1057.8799999999999s)]
*  their wheat and their barley. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1063.02s)]
*  So it's like a certain fungus that grows on wheat and it gives you an LSD like effect. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1064.96s)]
*  And they think that that might have been the source of the Salem witch trials. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1071.24s)]
*  Wow. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1075.28s)]
*  Because at the time where this was taking place they had apparently had a late frost [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1076.28s)]
*  and when they have a late frost or an early frost rather. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1080.24s)]
*  Apparently when they have an early frost it makes these plants more subject to ergot poisoning. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1083.48s)]
*  And then they did some samples on some soil samples that they did find ergot. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1089.76s)]
*  I think they might have even like tested some things and found ergot in them. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1094.32s)]
*  But they so what they think was happening was these people were getting bad wheat that [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1097.64s)]
*  had ergot poisoning. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1101.16s)]
*  And so a lot of them would die because like there was a big one a big breakout of ergot [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1102.94s)]
*  poisoning in France a few years back. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1107.4s)]
*  Not a few years quite a while back. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1110.24s)]
*  But it was the same kind of thing like a bunch of people died. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1111.88s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1114.48s)]
*  From ergot and other people just tripping balls. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1115.48s)]
*  I was gonna make an ergot joke but I was gonna say didn't Hugh Jackman win an ergot? [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1117.56s)]
*  Does he have an ergot though? [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1122.88s)]
*  Sorry to go off topic. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1128.6000000000001s)]
*  What is an ergot? [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1129.6000000000001s)]
*  It's like an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony I think is what it is. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1130.6000000000001s)]
*  That's what it is right. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1137.16s)]
*  Yeah he's probably got all those right? [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1138.16s)]
*  He's so talented. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1139.48s)]
*  Yeah that guy can do everything. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1140.48s)]
*  He's missing an Oscar for that guy. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1141.48s)]
*  Aw come on Hugh. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1142.48s)]
*  How does he not have an Oscar for Wolverine? [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1143.48s)]
*  I know what the fuck. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1144.5600000000002s)]
*  What are they? [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1145.5600000000002s)]
*  Communists? [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1146.5600000000002s)]
*  The fuck's going on? [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1147.5600000000002s)]
*  That guy's awesome. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1148.5600000000002s)]
*  He's amazing. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1149.5600000000002s)]
*  Hugh's Jacked Man. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1150.5600000000002s)]
*  He got jacked for Wolverine. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1152.04s)]
*  He got fucking jacked. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1154.04s)]
*  He's amazing. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1155.84s)]
*  He does it all? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1156.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1157.84s)]
*  He's like Will Smith can do everything. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1158.84s)]
*  It's so cool. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1160.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1161.3999999999999s)]
*  There's people out there like Jamie Foxx. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1162.3999999999999s)]
*  He can do anything. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1163.3999999999999s)]
*  Anything. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1164.3999999999999s)]
*  Beiber can do anything. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1165.3999999999999s)]
*  Anything. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1166.3999999999999s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1167.3999999999999s)]
*  I'm like where's the, it's like just much like the double brain size thing. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1168.3999999999999s)]
*  I miss the boat on those jeans. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1173.04s)]
*  But you didn't miss it for making music. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1175.3999999999999s)]
*  It's like your brain is designed specifically for what you do. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1177.08s)]
*  It's what's beautiful. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1180.24s)]
*  It's what you found the thing that your brain works perfectly for. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1181.92s)]
*  Everybody's brain is different, man. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1185.72s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1187.2s)]
*  Auto-Tune really unlocked a whole lot of opportunity for me. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1188.2s)]
*  So thank you Antares, our inventor of said program. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1191.2s)]
*  Don't you think that as ChatGPT can make Post Malone songs, people are still going to want [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1198.44s)]
*  to know it came from you. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1204.76s)]
*  That's going to be more valuable to people. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1206.84s)]
*  There's people that love your songs just because they sound good. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1208.96s)]
*  But there's also people that love your songs because they come from you. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1211.68s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1214.04s)]
*  I understand that. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1215.04s)]
*  I guess the thing that I'm concerned is pretty soon, you can still tell if it's an AI song, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1216.48s)]
*  now. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1228.04s)]
*  But the way that it's moving, like I don't know, my buddy, Louis Bell, he produces a [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1229.52s)]
*  bunch of my stuff and we write together and he's the most talented, smart dude ever. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1235.24s)]
*  But he taught me about Epochs and how many Epochs a better AI template is. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1241.28s)]
*  And pretty soon, dude, it's going to be really, really good. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1249.84s)]
*  It's just going so fast. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1254.44s)]
*  So I don't know yet, but then they'll just do a video, just be like, guys, I made this [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1256.0s)]
*  song, it's so emotional. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1263.6s)]
*  This really comes from my heart. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1265.12s)]
*  But it's just a robot talking. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1267.24s)]
*  Not a robot, more like a deep fake or something like, guys, I wrote this song crazy and it's [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1270.2s)]
*  just an AI song. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1275.1200000000001s)]
*  And I'm like, well, fuck, that's better than anything I could have ever made. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1276.1200000000001s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1278.92s)]
*  It's not going to be better. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1279.92s)]
*  I think there's a thing about something coming from an artist. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1281.92s)]
*  As they're doing all these amazing AI images, they're very cool to look at. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1286.8s)]
*  But to me, it's cooler if I know a person made it. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1293.28s)]
*  It definitely is cooler. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1297.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1298.2s)]
*  It's just like, I feel like we look at it different. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1299.2s)]
*  I feel like the attention span is getting so short now with short form content and stuff [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1306.24s)]
*  like that. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1313.44s)]
*  And it's super instant gratification. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1314.44s)]
*  So it's like, why, as a fan of someone, even as a fan in a couple of years, I don't see [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1316.24s)]
*  Hey, I want Post Malone to make a song about this thing that specifically happened to me [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1323.82s)]
*  with the specific person's name in it, with this stuff. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1329.9399999999998s)]
*  And this is super relatable to me. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1334.1s)]
*  That's what I want. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1336.78s)]
*  So then you can just type in the prompt, all this shit, and it'll just shit you out a song [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1337.78s)]
*  and it'll be the most personalized experience for you. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1342.7s)]
*  That's weird. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1347.98s)]
*  Isn't that weird? [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1348.98s)]
*  That's fucking weird. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1349.98s)]
*  But that's exactly where it's going. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1350.98s)]
*  100%. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1352.14s)]
*  100%. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1353.14s)]
*  There's a ton of fake advertisements online right now of me selling products. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1354.14s)]
*  It's just my voice. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1359.58s)]
*  This is the most amazing thing ever. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1361.18s)]
*  Yeah, and I got suckered out of it figuring out, you never bought those boner pills. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1362.18s)]
*  You never endorsed those boner pills. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1365.3s)]
*  And I was like, oh, they're good enough for Joe. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1366.8600000000001s)]
*  I mean, fuck. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1368.6200000000001s)]
*  They didn't work. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1369.6200000000001s)]
*  There's so many things that are selling. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1370.6200000000001s)]
*  They're selling so many things. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1373.1s)]
*  I found like 10 of them. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1374.18s)]
*  It's weird. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1376.14s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1377.14s)]
*  They can get, it's pretty close. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1378.14s)]
*  You can kind of tell when you listen, something's off. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1379.9s)]
*  There's the uncanny valley, I guess. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1383.22s)]
*  There's something off. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1386.22s)]
*  Well, here's the thing. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1387.22s)]
*  You do a podcast. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1388.5800000000002s)]
*  So talking about like Epoch. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1389.5800000000002s)]
*  So I guess you know Epoch's in like AI. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1390.94s)]
*  Yeah, so you have so many because your job is literally just talking to silence. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1394.1000000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1401.7800000000002s)]
*  There's no music. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1402.7800000000002s)]
*  There's no background noise. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1403.7800000000002s)]
*  There's no nothing. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1404.7800000000002s)]
*  You're just having a conversation. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1405.7800000000002s)]
*  And so they can take all of your episodes and just run it through this thing. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1407.3799999999999s)]
*  And so it's all your nuance and intricacies in the way you talk and shit like that. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1413.58s)]
*  Your breath, all that stuff. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1420.6599999999999s)]
*  They have all of it because it's uninterrupted by music or background. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1422.72s)]
*  They'll probably even be able to figure out a way to get you to make noises you've never [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1427.34s)]
*  made just by knowing the range that you have that's possible. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1431.3s)]
*  Like, ah? [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1434.8999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, like some kind of weird scream or something. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1435.9s)]
*  Now they got that one. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1440.74s)]
*  But they'll be able to just know what the shape of your vocal box was. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1441.74s)]
*  Like I think that's one of the ways that when they look at ancient primates, they test the [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1450.7s)]
*  size of where the opening of the mouth and what kind of sounds they could make and what [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1455.46s)]
*  that shit would sound like. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1461.3000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, but yeah, that's so weird how like, were they wrong about the noises that dinosaurs [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1462.82s)]
*  make? [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1472.3799999999999s)]
*  I don't think they know. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1473.3799999999999s)]
*  I don't think they know. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1474.3799999999999s)]
*  I mean, if you watch Jurassic Park, it's just whatever sounds cool. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1475.82s)]
*  Because you ask someone to make a dinosaur noise, they're going to do like, ah! [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1478.78s)]
*  Right, but what benefit would it be for a dinosaur to make noise? [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1484.54s)]
*  The thing is that no lizards make noise. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1487.82s)]
*  Komodo dragons don't make noise. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1489.86s)]
*  No crocodiles don't make noise. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1491.7s)]
*  No reptiles make noise. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1492.9s)]
*  No snakes make noise. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1494.22s)]
*  So why would we ever think that dinosaurs would be so stupid that they'd just be yelling? [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1495.22s)]
*  Well rattlesnakes, exactly. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1499.42s)]
*  They just run around, ah! [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1500.42s)]
*  Like scaring off everything they're trying to do. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1503.22s)]
*  It's an alligator growl. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1505.02s)]
*  They do growl. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1506.02s)]
*  Oh, they growl a little. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1507.02s)]
*  Okay, alligators growl? [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1508.02s)]
*  They don't roar. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1509.02s)]
*  They don't bark or anything. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1510.02s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1511.02s)]
*  That's a cool sound for sure. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1512.02s)]
*  It certainly, it sounds like a... [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1513.02s)]
*  It's probably a burp. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1514.02s)]
*  He's probably eating someone's foot right now. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1515.02s)]
*  Swallowing someone's fucking sneaker. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1516.74s)]
*  Look at that creep. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1518.46s)]
*  Fucking creeps. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1520.5800000000002s)]
*  They've been around longer than dinosaurs too. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1522.5s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1524.8999999999999s)]
*  Or during the time of dinosaurs. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1525.8999999999999s)]
*  They used to be so big, man. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1526.8999999999999s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1527.8999999999999s)]
*  They used to be so big. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1528.8999999999999s)]
*  I like that noise. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1530.4199999999998s)]
*  It's a pretty dope noise. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1531.4199999999998s)]
*  It sounds like a fucking nasty growler. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1532.4199999999998s)]
*  It literally sounds like it's being amplified by a porcelain bowl there. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1535.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1538.8999999999999s)]
*  It's just like a, ugh, long day. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1539.8999999999999s)]
*  Long day eating fucking shrooms. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1542.78s)]
*  That's exactly what it sounds like. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1543.78s)]
*  Yeah, sloppy joes and a couple of beers. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1544.78s)]
*  Not the sloppy joes. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1547.78s)]
*  Sloppy joes will get you son. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1549.98s)]
*  They will get you. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1551.86s)]
*  I mean it's almost like they come pre-digested. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1552.86s)]
*  You know? [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1555.78s)]
*  Yeah, perfect. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1556.78s)]
*  It's just going to slip right through the whole system. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1557.78s)]
*  There's zero resistance with a sloppy joe. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1559.78s)]
*  It goes out the exact same way it came in. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1563.62s)]
*  It's so fucked. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1566.1399999999999s)]
*  Just lubed up and ready to go. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1567.1399999999999s)]
*  Mixed with bread. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1568.78s)]
*  I'm never going to eat another one again. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1569.78s)]
*  They're delicious. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1570.78s)]
*  They are so good. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1571.78s)]
*  They're delicious. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1572.78s)]
*  At a fucking barbecue? [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1573.78s)]
*  A good solid sloppy joe? [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1574.78s)]
*  Damn. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1576.78s)]
*  Well there's nothing solid about it. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1577.78s)]
*  Yeah, nothing solid. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1579.78s)]

*  Oh yes. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1585.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1586.78s)]
*  Yeah, we get it delivered to the club a lot too. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1587.78s)]
*  They're amazing. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1589.78s)]
*  It's just like, you can't have bad barbecue and survive out here. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1590.78s)]
*  I'm interested about the move. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1594.78s)]
*  Have you had like, like you found your, like this place is amazing. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1597.78s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1602.78s)]
*  The move here, because last time I was on we were talking, it's been three years, and [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1603.78s)]
*  that was right before you moved you said. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1608.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1610.78s)]
*  And I don't know. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1611.78s)]
*  I love, whenever I moved here it was amazing. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1612.78s)]
*  Like the food fucking just blew me away. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1614.78s)]
*  Food's incredible. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1616.78s)]
*  Like. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1617.78s)]
*  The people are so cool. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1618.78s)]
*  It's just great being out of LA. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1619.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1620.78s)]
*  LA, look there's a lot of cool people in LA. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1621.78s)]
*  I loved it. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1623.78s)]
*  I lived there for a long time. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1624.78s)]
*  But it's so tense. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1625.78s)]
*  There's so many people. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1627.78s)]
*  And I don't think people are supposed to live that jammed up like that. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1628.78s)]
*  I just don't think it's good for you. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1631.78s)]

*  They feel like they're real. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1645.78s)]
*  They feel like it's dangerous. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1646.78s)]
*  Sure. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1647.78s)]
*  They're out there in the street. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1648.78s)]
*  Sure. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1649.78s)]
*  But me, I like to be, I like to relax. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1650.78s)]
*  Me too. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1653.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1654.78s)]
*  I mean that's like, being on tour too and being in the hotels like and going to, you [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1655.78s)]
*  know, because I lived in LA for like five years. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1660.78s)]
*  And but being on tour and being in the hotels like and like New York and Boston and it is [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1665.78s)]
*  so noisy. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1671.78s)]
*  And then you go back to Utah and you're like, oh my God, it's crazy. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1672.78s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1677.78s)]
*  Yeah, it's crazy. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1678.78s)]
*  It's it's like it's night and day. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1679.78s)]
*  And you never really if you live in those like environments, you never really notice [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1682.78s)]
*  it. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1686.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1687.78s)]
*  You never really notice like a helicopter going by every 30 seconds or whatever. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1688.78s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1693.78s)]
*  But then you're out in Utah and you're like, oh my God, this is so much quieter. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1694.78s)]
*  I think there's just a I think people give off something that probably we can't put on [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1696.78s)]
*  a scale. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1703.78s)]
*  But there's like an energy that people give off. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1704.78s)]
*  That's one of the reasons why people like crowds. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1706.78s)]
*  I think people when they're around a bunch of other people, they give off a kind of energy. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1708.78s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1712.78s)]
*  And when I think when there's too much of that, like a place like LA or New York in [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1713.78s)]
*  particular, because New York is just jammed. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1717.78s)]
*  Everybody's stacked on top of each other. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1719.78s)]
*  I think there's this buzz that's like always there that some people really enjoy. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1721.78s)]
*  It scares me. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1726.78s)]
*  It's a it's an anxious feeling for me. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1727.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1729.78s)]
*  Like being whenever I was out there, I had my baby and my doctor was out there. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1730.78s)]
*  So whenever her mom was, you know, towards the end of her pregnancy and we were like, [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1734.78s)]
*  OK, we're getting ready. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1740.78s)]
*  We had the baby in LA. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1741.78s)]
*  And so like we were there so we could see the doctor and, you know, she can go in to [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1744.78s)]
*  labor or whatever at any minute. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1748.78s)]
*  So we were there for a couple of months and stuff. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1750.78s)]
*  And I would go outside at night and I'm like, oh, my God, like it felt like impending doom [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1754.78s)]
*  for some reason. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1760.78s)]
*  Helicopters. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1761.78s)]
*  And there's just noise, noise, noise. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1762.78s)]
*  And I'm like, it was so thick. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1765.78s)]
*  I was like, where is it all coming from? [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1767.78s)]
*  You know, like, I don't know. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1769.78s)]
*  It just gave it such an anxious feeling for me to go outside. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1771.78s)]
*  And I'm like, it's so like it sounded like I know it didn't happen. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1774.78s)]
*  I don't know what this sounds like, but just like it felt like the aliens couldn't invade [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1779.78s)]
*  at any time. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1785.78s)]
*  You know, it was just like I was like, oh, I know something's coming. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1786.78s)]
*  It's scary. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1790.78s)]
*  You know, well, I think there's a thing that happens when there's too many people where [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1791.78s)]
*  people don't interact with each other to your which feels weird because then you feel like [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1796.78s)]
*  all these people that you're running into, like their potential problems or their potential [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1800.78s)]
*  threats or their potential annoyances. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1805.78s)]
*  Like, let me get away from these people. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1807.78s)]
*  And it's just that's not how it is when there's a few people. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1809.78s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1813.78s)]
*  When you walk down the street in a small town and you see somebody like, what's up, dude? [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1814.78s)]
*  No shit, there's a person there. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1817.78s)]
*  What's up? [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1818.78s)]
*  Yeah, a person, my other person. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1819.78s)]
*  It's just when it's thousands of them and they're all around you, nobody talks to anybody. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1821.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1824.78s)]
*  Like you don't strike up a casual conversation when you're in a crowded line filled with [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1825.78s)]
*  people walking down the street. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1830.78s)]
*  People don't talk. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1832.78s)]
*  Everybody's got their own shit to do. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1833.78s)]
*  And it's so weird. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1835.78s)]
*  Like you look at like even a hundred years ago, like people would sit down like on a [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1836.78s)]
*  bench and just be like, what's up? [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1842.78s)]
*  How are you? [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1845.78s)]
*  Like and have like conversations. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1846.78s)]
*  And I was I don't remember exactly where I was, but I think I was in New York doing [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1848.78s)]
*  something and there was a guy, I was doing like a show and we were in this building and [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1853.78s)]
*  there was like a smoking area outside and there was this guy playing chess with himself. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1857.78s)]
*  Wow. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1863.78s)]
*  And my buddy goes up and he's like, hey, can I play chess with you? [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1864.78s)]
*  And it was like, yeah. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1869.78s)]
*  And it's just like how shit would have gone like a hundred years ago. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1870.78s)]
*  But now it's just like, I don't want to talk to anybody. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1873.78s)]
*  Like you know, it's so fucking weird, man. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1876.78s)]
*  It is. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1878.78s)]
*  We don't we don't have like that interaction because we got we got so much shit to do. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1879.78s)]
*  Everybody got kind of hoodwinked into this idea that the key to a successful life is [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1884.78s)]
*  working more than you should. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1890.78s)]
*  Sure. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1892.78s)]
*  You know, and that that's the way it is kind of the way to get ahead. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1893.78s)]
*  I mean, it is a competition and there are people out there that are going to hustle harder than you. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1895.78s)]
*  But if you're not enjoying yourself, you don't balance it out with enjoying yourself, you're [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1900.78s)]
*  going to have a shitty existence. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1906.78s)]
*  The whole point is to have a good existence, have a fun existence. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1908.78s)]
*  Sure. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1912.78s)]
*  It's not just about success, but everybody's so driven and just get ahead that it's hard [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1913.78s)]
*  for them to separate those two and realize there's a balance. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1918.78s)]
*  Like you can't drink Coca-Cola all day. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1922.78s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1924.78s)]
*  It's a balance. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1925.78s)]
*  Drink it occasionally. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1926.78s)]
*  And that balance, you can achieve it, but it's very hard to when you got your eyes on the prize. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1927.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1932.78s)]
*  You know. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1933.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1934.78s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1937.78s)]
*  I mean, I'm by no means the most talented person or anything like that, but I did work really [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=1938.78s)]

*  For sure. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2011.78s)]
*  I mean, and now with like everything that we have in place right now, it's almost impossible. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2012.78s)]
*  It's almost impossible. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2019.78s)]
*  But that's the goal. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2020.78s)]
*  The goal is to have as much money as you need to never have to worry about it. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2021.78s)]
*  Yes. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2027.78s)]
*  So so you can actually go and live life. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2028.78s)]
*  Yes. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2032.78s)]
*  As a fucking kid and just eat fucking chicken nuggets and fucking go run around in the desert and go eat worms and shit. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2033.78s)]
*  Well, I don't do that. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2040.78s)]
*  But have fun. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2041.78s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2042.78s)]
*  Yeah, have fun. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2043.78s)]
*  And people, when they are serious about something, especially like we're talking about, people have their eyes on the prize. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2044.78s)]
*  They're trying to get ahead. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2049.7799999999997s)]
*  It's hard for them to disconnect and have fun. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2051.7799999999997s)]
*  My wife taught me how to do it. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2053.7799999999997s)]
*  I really used to have a hard time with it. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2055.7799999999997s)]
*  I used to have a hard time with vacations because I always felt like I was missing work. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2057.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2060.7799999999997s)]
*  Like stuff I should be doing. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2061.7799999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2062.7799999999997s)]
*  But it's just a mindset that I learned how to like slide into and I learned how to chill at the end of the days, too. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2063.7799999999997s)]
*  I never used to know how to chill at the end of the day. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2068.7799999999997s)]
*  I would just stay ramped up until I was tired, wake up and go, let's fucking go. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2070.78s)]
*  And it was just it's just not sustainable. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2075.78s)]
*  It is sustainable. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2078.78s)]
*  I did it for a long time. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2079.78s)]
*  But I think it's mentally sustainable. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2080.78s)]
*  Right. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2082.78s)]
*  I think the mind is the your mind. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2083.78s)]
*  It's not a good head space to be in all the time. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2085.78s)]
*  You need to be enjoying this shit. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2089.78s)]
*  You need to you need to be able to just fucking it's so timeless, but it's so true. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2090.78s)]
*  Stop and fucking smell the fucking roses. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2098.78s)]
*  I mean, they certainly do. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2101.78s)]
*  They're so cute, too. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2103.78s)]
*  My baby was like we had flowers delivered to the room and she would like hold it up to my nose and like you smell this shit because this shit is so cool. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2104.78s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, that's so cute. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2112.78s)]
*  A baby knows that you can smell it, too. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2113.78s)]
*  She smells it and she wants you to smell it. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2116.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2118.78s)]
*  Pretty wild. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2119.78s)]
*  She got the double brain. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2120.78s)]
*  I got back to the vacation. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2121.78s)]
*  So I wanted to say something about that, too. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2123.78s)]
*  Have you ever been I don't know how your family is or how your buddies are, but have you ever been on a vacation and the people who plan the vacation are super militant about the itinerary? [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2126.78s)]
*  Oh, and you can't even vacation. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2141.78s)]
*  Oh, do you know what I'm talking about? [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2143.78s)]
*  I do know what you're talking about. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2145.78s)]
*  But fortunately, I haven't experienced one of those. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2147.78s)]
*  It is cursed. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2149.78s)]
*  Because I've seen people go through it. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2150.78s)]
*  You're in this like beautiful place and they're like, all right, guys, so 6 a.m. tomorrow morning. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2153.78s)]
*  You guys are out. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2160.78s)]
*  It's like three o'clock and you're all drunk and everybody's like, all right, so you're going to get up at six, right? [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2161.78s)]
*  You're going to be up at six to go fucking do something in the sun. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2167.78s)]
*  And it's the hottest of all time after three hours of sleep. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2172.78s)]
*  And I'm like, yeah, I'll be there. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2175.78s)]
*  You don't want to be you don't want to be mean and be like, I'm not going. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2178.78s)]
*  I'm not going. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2181.78s)]
*  And then you also then you get FOMO. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2182.78s)]
*  I don't think it's mean. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2184.78s)]
*  I don't think it's mean. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2186.78s)]
*  I think it's kind of mean to tell you what to do. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2187.78s)]
*  Especially vacation. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2190.78s)]
*  Yeah, Greg. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2191.78s)]
*  Yeah, Greg. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2192.78s)]
*  No, I don't know. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2193.78s)]
*  But maybe it's some cool shit like we're going to go Marlin fishing. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2194.78s)]
*  We've got to be up at five a.m. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2199.78s)]
*  Sounds good. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2201.78s)]
*  We all agree to it and we chartered the boat. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2202.78s)]
*  So we got to get up. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2203.78s)]
*  OK, let's go. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2204.78s)]
*  I got a shark in the Maldives. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2205.78s)]
*  Did you really? [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2207.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2208.78s)]
*  Really? [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2209.78s)]
*  It was super random. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2210.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2211.78s)]
*  We went to the Maldives and we started throwing lines out on the on the boat and we caught [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2212.78s)]
*  grouper and all that stuff. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2220.78s)]
*  And we were using like just little inch pieces of bait and regular line. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2222.78s)]
*  And I cast my line out and I started bringing it back. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2230.78s)]
*  And I was like, oh, I'm on a rock. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2236.78s)]
*  I'm on a rock. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2238.78s)]
*  But then the rock went like OK, maybe this isn't a rock. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2239.78s)]
*  And so we sat and fought it for like 25 minutes and it was a nine foot nurse shark. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2244.78s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2249.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2250.78s)]
*  Totally on accident with this much bait and just a regular line. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2251.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2256.78s)]
*  Nurse sharks are that sad because that's a sweet shark. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2257.78s)]
*  We let. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2259.78s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, of course. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2260.78s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2261.78s)]
*  But I was like I was like. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2262.78s)]
*  But she got a fucking hook in her face. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2263.78s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2265.78s)]
*  It was it was so random. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2266.78s)]
*  I was like I thought I caught a rock because that's usually all I catch whenever I go fishing. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2267.78s)]
*  You know what's fucking weird? [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2272.78s)]
*  What's really weird about fishing is catch and release. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2273.78s)]
*  Catch and release fishing is for sharks, for any kind of fish. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2276.78s)]
*  It's fucking it's kind of weird. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2280.78s)]
*  Why so? [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2281.78s)]
*  Because you're just doing it for fun. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2282.78s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2284.78s)]
*  Sure. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2285.78s)]
*  You're not doing it for food. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2286.78s)]
*  Sure. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2287.78s)]
*  And you're essentially risking this animal's life. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2288.78s)]
*  Sure. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2291.78s)]
*  With a hook. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2292.78s)]
*  Sure. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2293.78s)]
*  Deep in its throat. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2294.78s)]
*  You're hoping it's going to survive. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2295.78s)]
*  What if you gilled it? [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2296.78s)]
*  You know, what if it got deep into the gills with like a Rapala with the big old treble [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2297.78s)]
*  hooks and it's bleeding internally and you know it's not going to make it. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2302.78s)]
*  Fuck, don't make me feel bad, man. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2305.78s)]
*  No, it's just a weird thing that people do. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2307.78s)]
*  It was an accident. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2308.78s)]
*  Not you, man. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2309.78s)]
*  I'm not even talking about that. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2310.78s)]
*  People specifically. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2312.78s)]
*  I've done it. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2313.78s)]
*  I'm a hypocrite. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2314.78s)]
*  I've done it before. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2315.78s)]
*  Well, you go catch and release fishing just because it's fun. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2316.78s)]
*  And just toss them back. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2318.78s)]
*  Yeah, like people do that with fly fishing. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2319.78s)]
*  Like oh, yeah, or you catch something tiny and you're like you throw it back. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2320.78s)]
*  With fly fishing, there's actually an argument that's not that big of a deal because fly [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2323.78s)]
*  fishermen, a lot of them use barbless hooks. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2327.78s)]
*  So, so they can remove it very easily and then maybe the fish can even like get it free [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2330.78s)]
*  if it jumps in the air. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2336.78s)]
*  But when they catch them, like a lot of fly fishermen are just catching release and trout. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2337.78s)]

*  Like, hey bro, you want some stereos? [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2648.78s)]
*  Well, they'd sell them at the restaurant. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2650.78s)]
*  Hey man, go flip my radio real quick. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2651.78s)]
*  Or if you can't, instead of doing dishes, if you can't pay, you just like, here, hold [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2655.78s)]
*  onto the radio for a little bit. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2659.78s)]
*  It's weird how quick that went away. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2662.78s)]
*  And what happened to, how come no one uses those steering wheel locks? [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2665.78s)]
*  They don't really work. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2671.78s)]
*  They don't? [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2673.78s)]
*  I mean, maybe some of them do. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2674.78s)]
*  I've seen people break them though. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2675.78s)]
*  You could break, you ever watch the lockpick lawyer? [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2677.78s)]
*  No. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2679.78s)]
*  On YouTube? [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2680.78s)]
*  No. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2681.78s)]
*  I don't know anything about lockpicking. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2682.78s)]
*  I want to learn. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2685.78s)]
*  It seems like just a cool thing to learn, playing video games and stuff. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2686.78s)]
*  I want to lockpick shit. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2690.78s)]

*  Splinter Cell. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2694.78s)]
*  Yeah, it's cool. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2696.78s)]
*  If you have a little lockpick tool in your box. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2697.78s)]
*  That's badass. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2700.78s)]
*  But to be able to pull that out is pretty cool. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2702.78s)]
*  But the lockpick lawyer, he can get into like anything. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2705.78s)]
*  Yeah, this is, dude, it's so cool, man. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2708.78s)]

*  I love this lock. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2716.78s)]
*  You know locks? [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2718.78s)]
*  No, sir. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2719.78s)]
*  But as you see here with this Toy 48, with the Toy 48, man, he'll get in here so quick. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2720.78s)]
*  Oh my God, you can get in anywhere with this thing. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2728.78s)]
*  And that's my favorite lock. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2730.78s)]
*  This is crazy. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2732.78s)]
*  Look how he's doing this. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2733.78s)]
*  That's your favorite lock. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2735.78s)]
*  Look how he's doing this. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2736.78s)]
*  This is nuts. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2737.78s)]
*  So they'll make, they'll do like challenges for him. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2738.78s)]
*  And he'll just get in there no problem. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2741.78s)]
*  It is so, and I never was interested, but this shit is like, it's like ASMR. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2744.78s)]
*  It is so fun to watch. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2750.78s)]
*  And I'll just watch this all night. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2752.78s)]
*  This is wild how he's doing this. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2753.78s)]
*  Where he's literally figuring out where the key slots are and pushing it into place. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2756.78s)]
*  So these cards are pretty cool. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2760.78s)]
*  So they make them for specific locks. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2762.78s)]
*  And you can just get in there and find like all the grid and all the indicators and shit like that. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2766.78s)]
*  I don't know exactly how it works. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2774.78s)]
*  Listen to me about it. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2776.78s)]
*  And so that is that a complicated. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2777.78s)]
*  Oh, so that's how it works. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2779.78s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2780.78s)]
*  So I'm explaining a bump lock using the same kind of thing. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2782.78s)]
*  You can get into anything with the right key. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2785.78s)]
*  Just bumping it hard enough. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2787.78s)]
*  Wow. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2789.78s)]
*  And they explained how that works. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2790.78s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2792.78s)]
*  Isn't that cool? [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2794.78s)]
*  That is fucking crazy. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2795.78s)]
*  But you got to wonder who invented the lock. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2798.78s)]
*  John Locke? [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2800.78s)]
*  It's a good question. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2801.78s)]
*  I believe his name was John Locke. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2802.78s)]
*  Thusly named. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2806.78s)]
*  Like what was a lock before a lock? [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2808.78s)]
*  You had like. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2810.78s)]
*  So maybe it was his name. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2812.78s)]
*  Trust. I don't know. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2813.78s)]
*  What would you say? [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2815.78s)]
*  Would you lock something up? [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2816.78s)]
*  What would that even mean? [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2817.78s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2819.78s)]
*  Before locks. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2820.78s)]
*  Was there like. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2821.78s)]
*  Before locks, people used to have to put boards inside their house to keep people from opening their doors. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2822.78s)]
*  Or just like a nice like. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2827.78s)]
*  Ritualistic signal on the symbol on the front of their door. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2830.78s)]
*  Don't come in here. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2833.78s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2834.78s)]
*  Well, like they would do with like like what's his name? [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2835.78s)]
*  Krampus. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2838.78s)]
*  Put this dead goat and like paint the blood on your front door. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2839.78s)]
*  Don't come in. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2843.78s)]
*  That would work. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2844.78s)]
*  I think that would work for this day. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2845.78s)]
*  No, to this day. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2847.78s)]
*  If someone comes up and tries to get into your house and you have like painted in blood like this crazy like rune. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2848.78s)]
*  I don't think they're coming in. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2856.78s)]
*  Unless that's what you're into. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2857.78s)]
*  I don't. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2858.78s)]
*  Maybe so. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2859.78s)]
*  You're like, bro. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2860.78s)]
*  Maybe you just get the craziest robbers of all time and they're like, he's got some cool shit. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2861.78s)]

*  He doesn't even want to hurt you. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2869.78s)]
*  He just wants to hang out. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2870.78s)]
*  He's like, hey, man. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2871.78s)]
*  Can you introduce me to Satan? [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2873.78s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2874.78s)]
*  He's in the basement right now. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2876.78s)]
*  I can introduce you to Satan, bro. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2881.78s)]
*  It's no problem. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2883.78s)]
*  Come on in, man. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2884.78s)]

*  It's tea time. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2886.78s)]
*  The kettle's on, sir. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2887.78s)]
*  We're going to call him. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2888.78s)]
*  Never call Satan after 3 a.m. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2889.78s)]
*  It's bad. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2891.78s)]
*  That's when he gets evil. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2892.78s)]
*  Never call the imposter from Among Us after 3 a.m. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2893.78s)]
*  The imposter from Among Us? [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2896.78s)]

*  I don't know what it is. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2930.78s)]
*  It got big over the pandemic. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2931.78s)]
*  Oh, it did? [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2932.78s)]

*  Oh, interesting. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2937.78s)]
*  Some would debate it's for babies, but it's pretty fun. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2938.78s)]
*  I don't play it. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2942.28s)]
*  Why would they say it's for babies? [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2943.28s)]
*  I don't know, just because babies play it sometimes. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2944.28s)]
*  Much like Fortnite. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=2947.78s)]

*  There were people on it and they're all kids. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3008.94s)]
*  And he would go everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3012.34s)]
*  And it's all kids to the point where there was an 18 and up bar and you would have to [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3015.9s)]
*  hold your arms out and they would measure your arm length to make sure that you weren't [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3020.6s)]
*  a kid. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3025.44s)]

*  I don't know, man. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3028.78s)]
*  It's just like... [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3030.06s)]
*  That's bizarre. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3031.06s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3032.06s)]
*  But it's just like... [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3033.06s)]
*  Well, that's pretty... [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3034.06s)]
*  Oh, there it is. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3035.06s)]
*  If someone's gonna do that, they're gonna do it. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3036.06s)]
*  Well, that's weird. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3037.62s)]
*  If someone's... [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3038.62s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3039.62s)]
*  Arms verification. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3040.62s)]
*  What if someone's really tiny? [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3045.62s)]
*  Right? [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3047.06s)]
*  Like, what happens to little people? [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3048.06s)]
*  Right, that's what I'm saying. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3049.06s)]
*  Yeah, what if it's like just a guy with a short wingspan? [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3050.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3054.38s)]
*  Yeah, you're fucked. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3055.38s)]
*  You can't get into the bar. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3056.7s)]
*  But that's all right because there was two people in there. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3058.1s)]
*  But the whole thing is... [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3060.1s)]
*  You're hanging out with kids? [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3062.1s)]
*  That's bizarre. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3063.1s)]
*  It's weird, man. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3064.1s)]
*  Yeah, that's a different thing. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3065.1s)]
*  That's like an interactive thing. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3067.6600000000003s)]
*  Not like if you're playing a video game and it's just you versus the computer. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3069.6600000000003s)]
*  And these fucking kids at these multiplayer games are so good. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3073.3s)]
*  Yeah, they have no life. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3077.82s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3079.5s)]
*  No mortgage. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3080.5s)]
*  They're so good. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3081.5s)]
*  No family. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3082.5s)]
*  I miss those days, man. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3083.5s)]
*  No aspirations. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3084.5s)]
*  They know when food is coming. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3085.5s)]
*  That's what I meant by whenever I said the goal of life is to be a kid, I meant like [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3086.5s)]
*  don't pay taxes. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3089.1400000000003s)]
*  So I haven't paid mine. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3090.1400000000003s)]
*  Just joking. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3091.1400000000003s)]
*  That's a joke, too. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3092.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3093.1400000000003s)]
*  Go to Puerto Rico. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3094.1400000000003s)]
*  You don't have to pay taxes? [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3095.1400000000003s)]
*  Well, there's a weird thing. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3096.42s)]
*  If you live in Puerto Rico, it's like 51% of the time or something like that. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3097.98s)]
*  I forget what the percentage is. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3101.22s)]
*  But you just roll the dice. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3102.62s)]
*  You don't pay federal taxes. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3103.62s)]
*  How do you do that? [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3105.5s)]
*  If you claim Puerto Rico as your residence, I'm going to fuck this up, but Peter Schiff [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3107.2599999999998s)]
*  explained it to me. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3111.46s)]
*  But that's why Jake and Logan Paul, they live in Puerto Rico. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3112.46s)]
*  You don't have to pay taxes. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3116.74s)]
*  Do you watch the fight? [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3117.74s)]
*  I did. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3118.74s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3119.74s)]
*  It's a good fight. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3120.74s)]
*  Jake did a great job. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3121.74s)]
*  He's... [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3122.74s)]
*  He's very talented. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3123.74s)]
*  He's big. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3124.74s)]
*  He's a big fella. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3126.3399999999997s)]
*  He's a big fella and Nate is definitely smaller than him. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3127.3399999999997s)]
*  Definitely doesn't hit as hard as him. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3130.18s)]
*  And Jake has a lot more experience in professional boxing now, for sure. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3132.5s)]
*  But he's legit. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3135.7799999999997s)]
*  He's a legit fighter. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3136.7799999999997s)]
*  I mean, yeah. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3137.7799999999997s)]
*  He looks good. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3139.58s)]
*  I mean, Nate... [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3140.58s)]
*  I just love watching Nate fight. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3141.8199999999997s)]
*  He's an animal. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3143.5s)]
*  He is amazing. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3144.9399999999996s)]
*  He is like one of my favorites to watch. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3146.3799999999997s)]
*  And I was super pumped to... [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3148.54s)]
*  It came on after the show in Dallas the first night, like two nights ago. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3150.06s)]
*  You're talking about having an MMA fight, which would be a way different fight. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3153.26s)]
*  I want that fight. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3156.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3157.3s)]
*  That's a way different fight. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3158.3s)]
*  I want that fight. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3159.3s)]
*  That's a way different fight. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3160.3s)]
*  I feel like... [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3161.3s)]
*  And I've never been in a combat sport before, but it changes everything. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3162.3s)]
*  It changes everything. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3169.1800000000003s)]
*  Like you see Nate kind of getting up against the rope because he wants the chain there. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3170.1800000000003s)]
*  You know? [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3177.98s)]
*  Right. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3178.98s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, in MMA or UFC or whatever, you can get up against... [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3180.86s)]
*  You tie him up. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3185.42s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3186.42s)]
*  But I don't know. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3187.42s)]
*  It's totally different. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3188.42s)]
*  It's totally different. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3189.5s)]
*  But Jake is a very good wrestler. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3190.62s)]
*  He's a great athlete, very good fighter. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3193.98s)]
*  And I know he's never done an MMA fight before, but if he had one, I think he'd be good at [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3196.82s)]
*  it. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3201.66s)]
*  I think he'd be good at it just like he's good at boxing. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3202.66s)]
*  He'd figure it out. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3204.18s)]
*  He's built crazy. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3206.54s)]
*  Like looking at him since his first fight. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3208.66s)]
*  He fucking trains hard. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3211.14s)]
*  He's big. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3212.46s)]
*  To go 10 rounds like that with Nate constantly coming forward, you've got to be in some serious [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3213.7s)]
*  shape. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3217.9s)]
*  Serious shape. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3218.9s)]
*  That's also a lot of experience too because you've got to know when to hit the gas and [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3220.7s)]
*  when to back off. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3223.74s)]
*  You can't just fight full blast for 10 rounds. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3225.74s)]
*  It's not possible. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3228.2599999999998s)]
*  I had to do... [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3229.2599999999998s)]
*  I was just doing... [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3230.6s)]
*  So we filmed a movie, a scene in a movie, and I had to go in and do voiceover for the [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3232.06s)]
*  movie for dubs, and they were telling me to throw fake punches. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3238.18s)]
*  And I did it for like 10, not even full on, for 10 minutes. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3242.8199999999997s)]
*  And I was like, oh my God. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3248.14s)]
*  I was so fucking sore and I was sore for the next week. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3250.74s)]
*  I was like, yeah. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3254.66s)]
*  And then you look at like 20 minutes? [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3256.22s)]
*  Or how long are the rounds? [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3258.62s)]
*  Well it's 10 three minute rounds. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3261.2599999999998s)]
*  10 three minute rounds. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3262.94s)]
*  30 minutes of boxing. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3263.94s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3264.94s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3265.94s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3266.94s)]
*  That's hard. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3268.7000000000003s)]
*  That's hard to do. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3269.7000000000003s)]
*  You know what's a great workout? [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3270.7000000000003s)]
*  The VR boxing games. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3271.7000000000003s)]
*  Have you ever fucked with any of those? [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3272.7000000000003s)]
*  No sir. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3274.02s)]
*  They're great. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3275.02s)]
*  I'm in the metaverse man. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3276.02s)]
*  I'm playing Among Us in VR. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3277.02s)]
*  They're great workouts that are in a game because you actually are boxing the guy. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3279.02s)]
*  You have these handsets on. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3283.86s)]
*  The handsets are your gloves. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3285.78s)]
*  So you actually throw punches and you move away from their punches and it shows you when [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3287.5s)]
*  you hit them. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3291.3s)]
*  And it measures your goggles too so it knows where your goggles are. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3292.3s)]
*  It knows exactly where you're at. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3294.7000000000003s)]
*  That's cool. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3295.7000000000003s)]
*  The head moves, the punches slip by. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3297.46s)]
*  You can duck under them and hit them with uppercuts. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3298.46s)]
*  So is it multiplayer? [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3301.06s)]
*  No. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3302.06s)]
*  You're single player. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3303.06s)]
*  You're just playing against the game. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3304.06s)]
*  I didn't know if you were fighting real people. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3305.06s)]
*  Because I was like imagine like oh fuck I'm a 12 year old at my house and I gotta box [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3306.06s)]
*  Joe Rogan. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3310.98s)]
*  You can do that in fencing. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3311.98s)]
*  I know in fencing you can have a fence off with each other. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3314.2999999999997s)]
*  I bet they have a thing for boxing where you can do it against someone. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3316.8199999999997s)]
*  Where you're both on opposite sides of the room and you're boxing each other. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3320.18s)]
*  Send me your gamertag so if I ever go up against you. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3325.54s)]
*  Gamertag is also quite old I think. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3330.1s)]
*  I used to be an Xbox guy. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3333.94s)]
*  Now I'm just a PC nerd. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3335.2599999999998s)]
*  Just PC? [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3338.5s)]

*  So it's just, we get it from everything and so we always have this uneasy feeling like [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3799.72s)]
*  whoever that person is is telling us the news, they're not being 100% real with us [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3804.72s)]
*  because they're not even talking real. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3808.72s)]
*  Today at 5pm we learned that there's a way they're talking where you know that it's not [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3810.72s)]
*  a fucking human, that's not a human. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3815.72s)]
*  And when they're trying to be a human it's even grosser. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3817.72s)]
*  It's a show. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3820.72s)]
*  Yeah and when they're trying to be sincere it's even grosser because it's like performative [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3821.72s)]
*  and you've always been, you've been performing as this news guy forever and now all of a [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3825.72s)]
*  sudden you're the real person. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3830.72s)]
*  Right. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3831.72s)]
*  Cut the shit man. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3832.72s)]
*  What is that? [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3833.72s)]
*  It's weird. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3834.72s)]
*  It makes us feel weird. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3835.72s)]
*  And that might not even be as human as they're even being. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3836.72s)]
*  It's not their fault you know because that's what their, that's their job. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3841.72s)]
*  That's their job. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3846.72s)]
*  You know that's their job to go up there. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3847.72s)]
*  So if you do show that human moment it's like and then you look at it and you're like oh [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3849.72s)]
*  is that actually real? [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3853.72s)]
*  Oh everyone thinks that's fake you know but maybe you know they do feel sad genuinely. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3854.72s)]
*  It's just so hard if you tell a sad story on the news and it's like you're reading [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3860.72s)]
*  off a teleprompter. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3866.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3867.72s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3868.72s)]
*  It's, it's interesting. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3869.72s)]
*  It is. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3870.72s)]
*  It's weird that we still need people to do it too. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3871.72s)]
*  Like we want a Walter Cronkite type person or some respected journalist, some Mike Wallace, [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3874.72s)]
*  some Barbara Walters, someone who like when they're talking. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3880.72s)]
*  There's one I know. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3883.72s)]
*  I know Barbara Walters. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3884.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3885.72s)]
*  There's well you know not when she's on The View but the olden days. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3886.72s)]
*  Sure. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3889.72s)]
*  When she would do investigative journalism. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3890.72s)]
*  What days? [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3892.72s)]
*  What days? [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3893.72s)]
*  Um, what you, what you, well. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3894.72s)]
*  I'm 95. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3895.72s)]
*  I'm 95. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3896.72s)]
*  Bro she's pretty your time for sure. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3897.72s)]
*  She's pretty my time. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3898.72s)]
*  She was, I think there's like some crazy thing where Barbara Walters, Anne Frank, and Martin [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3900.72s)]
*  Luther King Jr. were born in the same year. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3907.72s)]
*  Is that true? [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3909.72s)]
*  Did I just make that up? [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3910.72s)]
*  I think Anne Frank and Martin Luther King Jr. and then like one other. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3911.72s)]
*  She was born in 1929. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3915.72s)]
*  What? [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3917.72s)]
*  Son. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3918.72s)]
*  She passed away last year. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3919.72s)]
*  1929. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3922.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3923.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3924.72s)]
*  That, that lady's seen some shit. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3925.72s)]
*  That's when people. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3927.72s)]
*  The guy with the nickname was born in 1929. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3928.72s)]
*  Played chess with each other. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3930.72s)]
*  And Anne Frank was as well right? [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3931.72s)]
*  And Anne Frank. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3933.72s)]
*  1929. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3934.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3935.72s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3936.72s)]
*  All three of them were born the same, same year. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3937.72s)]
*  Did you see you didn't make that up? [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3938.72s)]
*  No. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3939.72s)]
*  Sometimes I'm wondering though. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3940.72s)]
*  No me too. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3941.72s)]
*  I fuck things up. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3942.72s)]
*  I definitely fuck things up. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3943.72s)]
*  The problem also like sometimes people tell me something and then I don't look it up and [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3944.72s)]
*  then I'll just repeat it. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3948.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah that's a whole other thing. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3950.2s)]
*  That's a whole other thing. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3952.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3953.24s)]
*  You got to like look things up. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3954.24s)]
*  Dick Clark. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3955.24s)]
*  Audrey Hepburn. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3956.24s)]
*  Arnold Palmer from 1929? [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3957.24s)]
*  Let's go. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3960.64s)]
*  The golfer? [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3961.64s)]
*  Wow. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3962.64s)]
*  He was born in 1929? [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3963.64s)]
*  I thought he was the drink guy. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3964.64s)]
*  Oh. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3965.64s)]
*  He made the drink. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3966.64s)]
*  He did. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3967.64s)]
*  I prefer myself a John Daly. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3968.64s)]
*  Which is the John Daly? [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3971.3599999999997s)]
*  That's vodka and Arnold Palmer. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3972.4399999999996s)]
*  John Daly's a wild boy. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3974.44s)]
*  Oh man. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3978.36s)]
*  That fellow. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3979.36s)]
*  What he can do is amazing. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3980.36s)]
*  He's known for being a dude who parties. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3982.8s)]
*  Sure. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3985.16s)]
*  And he's one of the best golfers ever. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3986.16s)]
*  Yeah man. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3987.6s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3988.6s)]
*  That's why I like. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3989.6s)]
*  Look at him out there. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3990.6s)]
*  Dude that's such a wave right there. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3991.6s)]
*  That's a wave right there. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3992.6s)]
*  Smoking a stogie and just sucking. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3993.6s)]
*  Big gut. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3995.8s)]
*  Plays like a fucking wizard. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3997.32s)]
*  He looks like a wizard. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=3999.08s)]
*  He does. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4000.08s)]
*  He's giving me big wizard vibes on this one. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4001.08s)]
*  I mean the guy's been doing it a long fucking time. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4003.4s)]
*  Many a man is in the ground that was thinking that John Daly was never going to make it. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4006.96s)]
*  I'd be pissed. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4011.36s)]
*  It's like, have you ever played Mortal Kombat and Bo Raichu? [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4012.36s)]
*  Who's Bo Raichu? [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4016.1600000000003s)]
*  He's the guy that was always drunk and he would puke on you. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4017.92s)]
*  And then he would always kick my ass in the game. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4021.12s)]
*  So imagine, that's kind of like. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4023.8s)]
*  Not to compare John Daly to Bo Raichu from Mortal Kombat. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4027.2400000000002s)]
*  Just imagine, you're out there and you go so hard and you're doing all the best training [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4031.6s)]
*  and all this shit and this guy just comes out with a John Daly and then just fucking [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4036.3199999999997s)]
*  hits the craziest shot. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4042.7599999999998s)]
*  I'd be, oh my god man. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4043.7599999999998s)]
*  There's some guys that don't look like they should be pro athletes or pro anything with [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4045.64s)]
*  your body and yet they're as good as anybody alive. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4052.08s)]
*  I mean, like, big country. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4057.16s)]
*  Oh yeah, Roy Nelson. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4061.3199999999997s)]
*  Roy Nelson put people into neighboring dimensions. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4063.6s)]
*  That dude hits so hard. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4067.08s)]
*  And by the way, he's like a legit Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4068.08s)]
*  He was an elite grappler. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4071.96s)]
*  I met him way back in the day, way before he had any MMA fights and he was just a really [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4073.72s)]
*  elite grappler. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4078.92s)]
*  But then he starts fighting in MMA and knocking people unconscious and can take a shot as [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4080.3999999999996s)]
*  good as anybody that's ever lived. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4085.2799999999997s)]
*  Beard is padding. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4086.44s)]
*  Have you thought of, did we? [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4087.44s)]
*  They used to say that with boxers. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4089.44s)]
*  They used to make them shave their beards. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4091.1600000000003s)]
*  Shave them off. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4093.36s)]
*  You couldn't have a big hairy beard because they really did think that it was padding. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4094.36s)]
*  Well, yeah, well that's what I was talking to somebody and they were like, hey, do you [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4097.6s)]
*  think it's like way, way, way, way, way far down the line to where like men grew beards [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4100.92s)]
*  because they were fighting each other? [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4106.72s)]
*  And they're like, okay, we'll get a little padding and it just grew over time? [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4108.28s)]
*  No, I think they had invented razors. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4111.16s)]
*  That's true. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4114.36s)]
*  How evolutionary? [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4115.44s)]
*  How did it grow? [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4116.44s)]
*  How did it start growing? [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4117.44s)]
*  It went away. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4118.44s)]
*  I think we had hair all the way up to the top of our face. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4119.44s)]
*  But why would it stay there? [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4123.08s)]
*  Well, like... [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4124.08s)]
*  Why do we have armpit hair? [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4125.08s)]
*  That's a good question. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4126.48s)]
*  Why do we have ball hair? [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4127.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4128.48s)]
*  What's up with asshole hair? [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4129.48s)]
*  So you can style it, of course. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4130.48s)]
*  Asshole hair is totally useless. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4131.48s)]
*  So you can braid it. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4132.48s)]
*  Keep your asshole warm. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4133.48s)]
*  No, the asshole hair is for catching dingleberries and everyone knows that. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4134.48s)]
*  It's for a little snack for later. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4138.88s)]
*  Oh, god. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4140.44s)]
*  I think what it is is we used to be covered in hair. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4141.44s)]
*  That's pretty obvious. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4144.6s)]
*  And then when the aliens came down and manipulated our DNA, they turned us into this. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4146.240000000001s)]
*  This weird hybrid thing. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4151.8s)]
*  I wish they turned me into that. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4152.8s)]
*  I wish they turned me into that. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4153.8s)]
*  How did I get stuck with it? [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4155.64s)]
*  I always miss the fucking cool shit, man. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4156.64s)]
*  Dude, I think if that is the case, if we were really truly created by aliens, that would [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4159.4400000000005s)]
*  be the most bizarre of all the possible... [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4167.320000000001s)]
*  We're still the same thing. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4170.120000000001s)]
*  But if we knew that that's how we came about, that would be probably the most bizarre thing [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4171.76s)]
*  ever. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4176.64s)]
*  From creation or crossbreeding? [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4179.280000000001s)]
*  Like crossbreeding. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4183.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4184.2s)]
*  Or like some genetic manipulation. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4185.2s)]
*  It's so weird. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4190.24s)]
*  Who fucking knows? [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4192.4800000000005s)]
*  But thinking about why are the depictions of aliens since recorded history, why are [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4194.36s)]
*  they always bipedal? [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4208.12s)]
*  Why do they always have the same face and eyes as us? [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4210.839999999999s)]
*  Like why? [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4215.799999999999s)]
*  Or big giant eyes. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4216.799999999999s)]
*  Why is that? [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4218.24s)]
*  Why is that? [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4219.24s)]
*  Because I don't know. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4220.24s)]
*  When people are like, oh, people would be like, well, they're just like, they made this [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4221.52s)]
*  up. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4228.080000000001s)]
*  They look like humans. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4229.080000000001s)]
*  But what if we look like them? [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4230.080000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4231.080000000001s)]
*  Or whatever we're being visited by now is just humans from the future or another offshoot [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4232.080000000001s)]
*  of humans from another dimension. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4242.8s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of people speculate on all those things. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4246.080000000001s)]
*  You know what's interesting about aliens, too? [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4249.160000000001s)]
*  Aliens, they always have eyes facing forward. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4251.84s)]
*  And in nature, things that have eyes facing forward are generally predators. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4255.96s)]
*  Things that have eyes on the side, like a deer or a pronghorn, they're looking for shit [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4260.44s)]
*  coming at them. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4265.12s)]
*  So they're looking left and right. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4266.639999999999s)]
*  But when something has eyes going forward, it's looking to attack, generally. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4269.44s)]
*  Like cats and wolves. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4274.139999999999s)]
*  They have eyes facing forward. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4276.36s)]
*  They always have eyes facing forward, which is interesting. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4279.52s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4282.200000000001s)]
*  Do you think if there is actually, who's to even fucking say what an alien even fucking [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4283.200000000001s)]
*  looks like? [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4288.92s)]
*  They could just be a blob of fucking energy or whatever the fuck. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4289.92s)]
*  But if we do personalize them like that, which we as humans tend to do, it makes it easier [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4294.52s)]
*  to fathom. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4300.320000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4303.52s)]
*  I don't know if I'm fathom of being in here that's just a glob of dust or a cloud. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4305.120000000001s)]
*  I'm like, whoa, this is insane. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4310.400000000001s)]
*  But if I look at it from like, oh, you're like me. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4312.92s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4316.6s)]
*  As far away in the galaxy as you might be from, you look kind of like me. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4317.6s)]
*  Well, just think about the me when you say me. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4322.52s)]
*  It's very intangible. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4325.160000000001s)]
*  It's not like my hand. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4327.0s)]
*  My hand is right here. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4328.92s)]
*  But my me, like who I am, my consciousness. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4329.92s)]
*  What is that? [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4332.68s)]
*  Where is that? [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4333.68s)]
*  Is that inside of me? [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4334.68s)]
*  Is it a part of me? [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4336.4400000000005s)]
*  Is it all of me together? [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4337.52s)]
*  Whatever it is, it's like you, like your consciousness is like this very unique energy that's you. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4339.6s)]
*  And mine is me. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4345.52s)]
*  And everybody has a different one. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4346.52s)]
*  And it's what the fuck is that? [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4348.0s)]
*  That's a weird thing. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4350.240000000001s)]
*  It certainly is. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4351.400000000001s)]
*  You know, whatever it is inside of your mind that's moving you around and responding to [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4352.400000000001s)]
*  questions and finding what you're interested in and pursuing your goals. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4357.4800000000005s)]
*  Whatever the fuck that thing is inside of you, that energy is very strange. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4361.88s)]
*  And it is super weird. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4366.04s)]
*  I remember you asked me if I wanted to smoke. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4367.68s)]
*  And I can't, I don't really smoke anymore. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4371.52s)]
*  And I actually talked for the longest time in my whole life. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4375.36s)]
*  I couldn't really explain this. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4378.28s)]
*  I couldn't like really like bring it to like words and try to explain it to where I wasn't [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4381.28s)]
*  like where just because was it made no sense. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4389.12s)]
*  But I talked to a couple of my buddies and they were like, oh, it's the same thing. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4394.6s)]
*  So a lot of my friends from smoking weed, it's like almost like a depersonalization [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4400.08s)]
*  thing to where it feels like for the longest time since I had I smoked one bad joint. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4404.84s)]
*  And for the longest time ever since then, it's felt like I've been almost like watching [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4412.56s)]
*  my life happen instead of actually like living it. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4418.5199999999995s)]
*  Does that make sense? [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4422.4s)]
*  It does. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4423.759999999999s)]
*  If you had like an episode, like if you smoked one bad joint and you got way too high and [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4424.919999999999s)]
*  you had like a break, like some sort of a schizophrenic break or some sort of strange [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4431.48s)]
*  episode. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4435.28s)]
*  And it just feels like a lot of the time it's like it's like I'm not doing it. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4436.28s)]
*  It's like almost as like I'm watching it happen. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4441.44s)]
*  Still to this day? [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4446.5199999999995s)]
*  To this day, a lot of the time. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4447.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4448.96s)]
*  And it happened because of that one joint? [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4449.96s)]
*  I never I had never felt it in my life before that. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4452.120000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4455.200000000001s)]
*  So it's like and I talked to my friends and they were like, oh, that's like like depersonalization. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4456.200000000001s)]
*  I don't exactly know what happens or what goes on. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4464.56s)]
*  But it's a pretty like common thing, I feel like for people who have had a negative experience [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4468.280000000001s)]
*  with like THC or whatever the fuck was in that joint that I had in LA that one time. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4476.16s)]
*  You know? [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4482.68s)]
*  Right. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4483.68s)]
*  You don't know what was in it. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4484.68s)]
*  That's true, too. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4485.68s)]
*  Maybe it was just fucking LSD or something and it like totally just like caught me. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4486.68s)]
*  But I felt different like to this day, I still feel different. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4492.12s)]
*  That's so weird. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4494.96s)]
*  But it could just be THC. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4495.96s)]
*  This guy, Alex Berenson, wrote a book about it. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4497.2s)]
*  It's called Tell Your Children. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4499.639999999999s)]
*  It's about how there's a certain percentage of people that especially with high dose THC, [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4502.240000000001s)]
*  they can have a schizophrenic break or a psychotic break. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4508.280000000001s)]
*  Something goes wrong. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4511.660000000001s)]
*  I used to smoke crazy. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4512.660000000001s)]
*  I used to smoke a lot, like do the volcanoes and all that shit. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4513.660000000001s)]
*  That's so fun. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4517.72s)]
*  It was so fun. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4518.72s)]
*  One time. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4519.72s)]
*  One time. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4520.72s)]
*  Wow, that's crazy. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4521.72s)]
*  One time. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4522.72s)]
*  Maybe there was something in it. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4523.72s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4524.72s)]
*  You know, when you're just getting a joint from some dude, you don't know the chain of [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4525.72s)]
*  custody. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4529.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah, no idea. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4530.280000000001s)]
*  Where was this cooked up? [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4531.759999999999s)]
*  No idea. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4532.759999999999s)]
*  Ron White was in the green room at the club one night and he pulled out this joint. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4533.759999999999s)]
*  He goes, this joint cost $75. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4537.759999999999s)]
*  What the fuck is that? [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4541.04s)]
*  He goes, got it from Beverly Hills. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4542.04s)]
*  I go, keep that shit the fuck away from me. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4543.04s)]
*  So all these other guys smoked it. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4545.679999999999s)]
*  Brian Simpson smoked it. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4547.92s)]
*  Duncan Trussell smoked it. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4549.12s)]
*  And they went on stage and Duncan said he didn't know what the fuck he was talking about. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4550.12s)]
*  He was like, what did you do to me? [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4554.24s)]
*  What the fuck? [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4556.2s)]
*  I thought it was weed. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4557.2s)]
*  But they get these joints now, these crazy dispensaries like in LA, it's legal now. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4558.62s)]
*  So they're lacing them with THC. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4564.46s)]
*  They got THC crystals in them and Keith in them. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4566.78s)]
*  These are not regular joints. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4570.66s)]
*  These are for dudes like B-Real. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4572.62s)]
*  Like the kind of shit that he smokes. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4575.98s)]
*  B-Real from, shout out to my man B-Real from Cypress Hill. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4577.98s)]
*  This is explicitly for B-Real. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4582.26s)]
*  That is the only man who can smoke this joint. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4584.34s)]
*  That dude is stone cold sober no matter how high he gets. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4586.9s)]
*  That is crazy man. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4590.94s)]
*  I wonder, like a lot of my buddies are like that too man. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4592.42s)]
*  You have to smoke a lot to feel high. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4596.139999999999s)]
*  I can't keep up with those fellas. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4600.54s)]
*  I can't keep up with those. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4602.179999999999s)]
*  I did a smoke box show where they get you super high and they put you in this dope car [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4603.62s)]
*  and they have cameras in the car and you sit there and just smoke. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4609.0199999999995s)]
*  You just hot box the car? [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4611.5s)]
*  Hot box the car. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4612.7s)]
*  And it's ridiculous. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4613.7s)]
*  I was so high I didn't know what the fuck I was talking about. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4615.0199999999995s)]
*  I was like I gotta get out of here. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4617.0599999999995s)]
*  I gotta go to bed. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4619.66s)]
*  I'm convinced too I get second hand high from my green room. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4620.9s)]
*  Oh you definitely do. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4625.0199999999995s)]
*  Because my buddies fucking blow down. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4626.0199999999995s)]
*  You definitely do. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4627.54s)]
*  I've seen people get second hand high from me in this room. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4628.82s)]
*  I've seen it where all of a sudden they have a hard time remembering what they're talking [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4631.98s)]
*  about. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4635.179999999999s)]
*  I go bro, you got high. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4636.179999999999s)]
*  You got high whether you liked it or not. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4637.58s)]
*  Maybe I am high. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4640.78s)]
*  Maybe a little bit. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4642.259999999999s)]
*  Maybe a touch. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4643.259999999999s)]
*  Nice. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4644.34s)]
*  I had a stint too where I tried to smoke like maybe two years ago. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4645.34s)]
*  And I was like it's amazing. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4650.38s)]
*  But then just shrooms is like for me. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4652.14s)]
*  Just so much more fun for me. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4655.38s)]
*  Shrooms should be legal. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4658.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4660.3s)]
*  Because I mean if you are, I mean I'm not a psychologist or a psychiatrist. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4661.3s)]
*  And if you're vulnerable, there's something wrong with your mind, you probably shouldn't [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4665.02s)]
*  be doing any kind of psychedelics. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4667.9800000000005s)]
*  But that's the case with a lot of stuff. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4670.22s)]
*  But for everybody else, just a little bit, just a little bit every now and then would [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4672.22s)]
*  make your life a little better. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4677.22s)]
*  Well it's interesting you said that too because now I talked to a bunch of my buddies who [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4678.46s)]
*  have served and they said oh they're giving them psilocybin to help with like PTSD and [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4685.5s)]
*  shit like that. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4693.3s)]
*  Yeah, this shirt that I'm wearing, this is a MAPS shirt, Multidisciplinary Association [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4694.3s)]
*  for Psychedelic Studies. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4699.14s)]
*  You know these guys? [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4700.14s)]
*  And they are doing a lot of great work with that with MDMA too. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4702.0599999999995s)]
*  MDMA for soldiers. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4705.66s)]
*  And so they're running these trials and these studies with MDMA and soldiers and they're [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4707.219999999999s)]
*  finding great results. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4710.62s)]
*  Yeah, it's really interesting. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4712.42s)]
*  And it's just like this is literally eating cow shit. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4714.339999999999s)]
*  It's nature. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4719.58s)]
*  And it's nature that human beings have utilized probably for thousands of years. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4720.58s)]
*  And we should get back to it. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4724.299999999999s)]
*  You got to wonder if that's, I mean we know why it's not legal. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4725.7s)]
*  Because it's going to make people invent tools and have better communication with each [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4730.46s)]
*  other and be more you know. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4736.94s)]
*  But the people that are, they should listen to this, the people that are trying to run [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4739.06s)]
*  the world. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4743.22s)]
*  You should be doing it too. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4744.62s)]
*  Because if you did it would change your consciousness and it would change your focus and you would [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4745.9800000000005s)]
*  still be just as successful. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4749.38s)]
*  Don't think you won't be. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4751.42s)]
*  You'll still be successful. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4752.42s)]
*  You'll be successful under a different metric. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4753.42s)]
*  You'll probably feel better. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4756.5s)]
*  You won't have this fucking guilt, this overwhelming guilt of living your life just constantly [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4758.099999999999s)]
*  trying to acquire money by unscrupulous methods. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4764.62s)]
*  Spend your money on shrooms. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4768.46s)]
*  You don't even have to spend that much money. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4769.46s)]
*  You just go flip some fucking cow tears. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4772.299999999999s)]
*  They're not that expensive and if you live in a good spot they're readily available outside. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4774.299999999999s)]
*  Which is wild. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4778.9s)]
*  I'm good man. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4779.9s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4780.9s)]
*  It's just one of those things that I think nature put here or we are, maybe not even [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4782.9s)]
*  by design but just by whatever it is about us and whatever it is about that. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4789.379999999999s)]
*  When that chemical interacts with ours and it's very similar to normal human neurochemistry [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4796.54s)]
*  apparently. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4802.139999999999s)]
*  That psilocybin when it interacts with us it's very positive for the most part. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4805.62s)]
*  Unless you have psychological problems. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4811.0599999999995s)]
*  Well that's, I think. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4813.0199999999995s)]
*  Or on certain medications. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4815.46s)]
*  It like, it made me, I was so fucking depressed and so fucking sad for so long and doing shrooms [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4816.94s)]
*  it took me out of that. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4828.5s)]
*  It made me see shit in like such a more, like it's not all fucking shitty. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4831.42s)]
*  It's not all shitty. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4836.5s)]
*  But did it feel all shitty for you even while you were successful? [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4837.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4840.9s)]
*  That's what's weird right? [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4841.9s)]
*  Right. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4842.9s)]
*  Because then you have it all and yet you still feel like shit. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4843.9s)]
*  That confuses a lot of folks. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4847.3s)]
*  And especially like I was fucking 18 like whenever the shit popped off and I was like [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4850.34s)]
*  oh fuck man I don't know what the fuck to do. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4855.82s)]
*  Everybody's looking at me. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4859.86s)]
*  I can't even imagine how like a Bieber or a Culkin or child actors or performers, like [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4862.1s)]

*  people's parents specifically or in particular, but the parents even then are like how much [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4878.3s)]
*  money can we make off of this kid? [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4885.660000000001s)]
*  And you see like a lot of YouTube families doing that shit. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4888.3s)]
*  It's like this kid doesn't know what the fuck is going on here. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4891.22s)]
*  He doesn't know what's going on here. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4894.700000000001s)]

*  It is weird. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4903.14s)]
*  And that's why like even when I had my baby, you see a lot of the time people are like [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4904.5s)]
*  first thing that happens, baby gets, baby fresh out of the coochie, right? [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4909.5s)]
*  And then right to Instagram or Twitter or whatever. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4917.02s)]
*  Here's my new fucking baby. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4919.9s)]
*  Like no shit. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4921.299999999999s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4922.299999999999s)]
*  And like the kid doesn't know what the fuck is happening. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4923.299999999999s)]
*  So like whenever they're older, they'll be like, oh, I saw your ass when you were a baby. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4926.179999999999s)]

*  So it was crazy. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4949.0199999999995s)]
*  And I'm like, you know what? [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4951.58s)]
*  You can, in this world that we live in right now, where everything is based off of a social [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4952.58s)]
*  currency and a like or a heart metric on any platform, I'm gonna let you fucking decide [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4959.139999999999s)]

*  You know? [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4970.82s)]
*  Yeah, that's, that's a great way to do it. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4972.219999999999s)]
*  I feel like people are just so entrenched in this idea that you have to share every [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4975.0599999999995s)]
*  aspect of your life and use that aspect of your life as a thing to get likes. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4981.54s)]
*  That's what's weird. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4987.38s)]
*  It's like that light, when they invented likes, boy, did they fucking hot wire our brain. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4988.38s)]
*  They lockpicked our brain. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4994.9s)]
*  They took away dislikes. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4995.9s)]
*  Yeah, they did. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4996.9s)]
*  Isn't that wild? [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4997.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4998.9s)]
*  That's wild too. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=4999.9s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5000.98s)]
*  It is wild. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5001.98s)]
*  I think about that all the time. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5002.98s)]
*  I'm like, huh? [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5003.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5004.98s)]
*  Why? [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5005.98s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5006.98s)]
*  To be nice? [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5007.98s)]
*  I don't think it's, you know, look, you're gonna get people to gang up on folks. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5008.98s)]
*  Sure. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5014.98s)]
*  You're gonna get people that weaponize that. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5015.98s)]
*  But that's also a way to indicate whether or not people like it or don't like it. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5018.379999999999s)]
*  I mean, that's the way to indicate whether people like it or don't like it. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5023.179999999999s)]
*  Are you saying I can only like it? [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5026.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah, wait. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5027.7s)]
*  I can like it or ignore it. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5028.7s)]
*  So like, then you can, by that, you know, gauge, you can tell if people really like [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5030.099999999999s)]
*  the video. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5035.34s)]
*  Say the video gets 100 million or let's just say a million views. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5036.34s)]
*  And then like, oh, a thousand people like this? [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5040.42s)]
*  Oh, they didn't really like that. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5042.58s)]
*  Right. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5044.3s)]
*  That's weird. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5045.3s)]
*  Right. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5046.3s)]
*  Why did it get so many views? [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5047.3s)]
*  Then you can kind of just subtract the amount of likes versus the views and then be like, [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5048.3s)]
*  well. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5054.3s)]
*  Well, there's always hate liking or hate watching. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5055.3s)]
*  People do a lot of hate watching. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5057.5s)]
*  They do a lot of watching shit they hate. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5058.86s)]
*  I'm a little guilty of that. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5060.46s)]
*  You seen the new NPC trend? [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5062.0199999999995s)]
*  What is the new NPC NPC trend? [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5064.74s)]
*  All right. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5066.74s)]
*  So maybe can you, Jamie, would you know what an NPC is? [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5067.74s)]

*  to it in like a way and they'll do it for hours. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5092.860000000001s)]

*  The Russian sleep experiment or whatever [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5203.46s)]
*  But just some NPC streamers [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5207.22s)]
*  What did they figure out from that like what is the limit of the human body where you can go without sleep? [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5209.22s)]
*  Well, I don't know if it's like if that experiment was real [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5213.780000000001s)]
*  But because you hear the story about it like you know the one where they're like [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5218.46s)]
*  I don't know if it's just like a creepypasta or whatever when they did the sleep experiment and services [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5222.06s)]
*  What happened? [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5228.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's a creepypasta. What is a creepypasta? It's like [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5230.139999999999s)]
*  Like a creepy story like a scary story that just a story that people tell but like real that but I wonder [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5234.58s)]
*  Oh, that's not like they murdered each other or something like that. Yeah, they started like murdering everybody [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5241.58s)]
*  So they say in this in this story. It's a story that makes sense [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5245.94s)]
*  But that makes sense that that's not really ever really push that if if they did they probably [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5249.5s)]
*  I won't talk about it. You know like right. It's so like inhumane like and [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5256.02s)]
*  Given well you think about fuck they're gonna kill me [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5261.1s)]
*  Just like MK ultra and all that shit man. I was about to go there all that shit like [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5266.540000000001s)]
*  I'll let you talk about it, so I just know what it is, but I don't know anything about it [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5272.14s)]
*  It's in a real program that the CIA was running [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5277.42s)]
*  That where they were experimenting with people with LSD to find out what LSD did and they wanted to know like how can we use it? [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5282.68s)]
*  Can we use it to interrogate our enemy our enemies? Can we use it as a truth serum? [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5289.48s)]
*  What can we do with it by the way guys? I have no idea what this stuff is there you go [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5294.68s)]
*  And what they did was they started experimenting and not just the United States [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5301.92s)]
*  They did it with British soldiers too in the 1950s [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5307.4s)]
*  There's video of these British soldiers that they gave him acid see if you can find that because it's a wild video [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5310.84s)]
*  These dudes they just dosed him up and how to run into the was like [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5317.12s)]
*  How do you how do you so do you have like? [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5321.92s)]

*  You ever watch that show manhunter. What is that? [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5326.84s)]
*  He's like the guy that like he's like all right if you can hide [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5329.360000000001s)]
*  I'm the best tracker in the world if you can hide from me on my horse like but how do they how do they keep? [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5332.12s)]
*  Track of what they did in the woods. That's a good question. How do they Jamie? [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5337.08s)]
*  Yeah, right so they what if they went super deep yeah, right? [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5343.04s)]
*  How do they keep track of them keep them from just going on an acid marathon? [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5347.5199999999995s)]
*  This is the fucking right after storming the beach at Normandy days [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5360.24s)]
*  You know these are wild times man people just ran into gunfire back then they were different men are these guys all on acid? [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5363.44s)]
*  Right yeah [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5369.919999999999s)]
*  They can't stop laughing so they're soldiers, and they're sitting there doing their job, but they can't stop laughing [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5371.96s)]
*  They're just tripping balls and then later. There's some footage of them in the woods [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5380.04s)]
*  They took them to the woods afterwards or maybe there's I think this is it might be a different one because I have not seen [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5383.719999999999s)]
*  But they I think they did it with a bunch of people and they did it at Harvard [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5389.72s)]
*  You know Ted Kaczynski the Unabomber. He was a part of the Harvard LSD studies [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5393.76s)]
*  He was a participant. Yeah, no shit. Don't that dude up with that no [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5398.12s)]
*  Yeah, they dosed him up with acid and then he was you know yeah, that guy have a rifle [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5402.44s)]
*  Yeah, so they have a dude with a rifle LSD, but yet they did look at these dudes. They got cameras and fucking [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5407.68s)]
*  What is he holding onto his headphones? [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5415.94s)]
*  They can't put the headphones on the tree they can't stop laughing look. It's a great drug [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5417.94s)]
*  And they were like okay. This has no military purpose at all [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5423.219999999999s)]
*  This is exactly the opposite of what we want. What did they do chop it? They're chopping it [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5427.5s)]
*  Are they chopping a tree? I don't know this guy's climbing a fucking tree. He's out of his mind [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5433.299999999999s)]
*  Why do they have firearms because they're army guys that's crazy though British Marines 1964 that was so [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5437.379999999999s)]
*  What what the CIA was doing is they were they were experimenting with [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5445.94s)]
*  Prostitutes so what they would do is they would set up a brothel [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5452.62s)]
*  And they would have these guys go in to try to get with the prostitute and the prostitute was a CIA agent [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5455.919999999999s)]
*  She would give them a drink that was laced with acid and they would watch these guys through two-way mirrors [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5461.259999999999s)]
*  That's insane. Yeah, they were just trying to figure out. What does acid do and it was just totally unsuspecting [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5467.94s)]
*  Yeah, and then there's mind control experiments [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5474.94s)]
*  There's definitely something going on with Charles Manson, and that's the Tom O'Neill book Chaos [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5478.0599999999995s)]
*  It's a great book about [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5484.799999999999s)]
*  MK ultra and the role that these guys that were running that program that they interacted with Manson [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5486.339999999999s)]
*  they interacted with him in prison and they think that they might have been the people that were supplying him with the acid or he [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5492.28s)]
*  Manipulate those kids and the whole thing was to discredit the anti-war movement [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5500.04s)]
*  they were trying to develop this attitude in America that hippies are dangerous and murderous and [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5504.72s)]
*  You know these people that are like stop the war these people are there a threat sure and so one of the ways they did [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5510.44s)]
*  It was this high-profile guy Charles Manson [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5517.04s)]
*  And they take this guy and they taught him how to run a fucking cult when he was in prison most likely [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5520.08s)]
*  They definitely in prison for beforehand. Oh, he's been in prison his whole whole life his whole life. Where's he from? [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5526.0s)]
*  That's a good question. I don't know where Manson was from [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5532.360000000001s)]
*  But the book Chaos I can't recommend that enough it's fucking incredible the guy worked on it for 20 years [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5537.400000000001s)]
*  I've talked about it a hundred times in the podcast if you listen to it before I'm sorry [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5543.04s)]
*  But that guy who is my friend Greg's neighbor my friend Greg Fitzsimmons. He was this guy's neighbor like 20 years ago [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5546.72s)]
*  He's working on this and he got hired to write a story about the anniversary of the Tate LaBianca murders and [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5553.28s)]
*  When he got hired to write that story started finding all these inconsistencies in the story [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5561.12s)]
*  And so he started doing like real journalism [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5566.8s)]
*  And it's just like he went on a deep dive like way too long and he wrote it for 20 fucking years [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5569.16s)]
*  Yeah, and 20 finally they got together [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5573.759999999999s)]
*  They helped him with an editor and they put it all together and they put together this book this book is insane [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5576.5599999999995s)]
*  It's insane [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5580.92s)]
*  It's I don't know. That's [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5582.92s)]
*  Such a crazy. It's so crazy and the thing about I [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5585.16s)]
*  Don't know if it's harder [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5590.8s)]
*  To like pull the wool over people's eyes now [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5595.2s)]
*  rather than then [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5599.16s)]
*  Does that make sense? Yeah, I don't know either because there's so many different like we were talking about the news [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5601.52s)]
*  You know you go on the news and you get caught in this it's like a perpetual it's a wheel [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5608.64s)]
*  You know what I mean, and you just keep getting especially now due to the algorithms that we have [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5614.28s)]
*  Yeah, you just keep getting fed the same information to like perpetuate what you [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5619.16s)]
*  Want to learn about and what they want you to know about but back then? [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5625.88s)]
*  It wasn't as accessible [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5631.04s)]
*  So I wonder if it was harder back then [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5633.36s)]
*  To like [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5636.4400000000005s)]
*  Trick the populace into believing something than it is now [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5638.28s)]
*  I think it was probably easier because I think they probably had more respect for institutions because they didn't have the access to them that [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5641.8s)]
*  We have now [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5648.92s)]
*  Like think about what a president was like back then presidents openly had affairs [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5650.4800000000005s)]
*  No one reported on it. They were they were just revered figures [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5655.360000000001s)]
*  It was a different thing like when Kennedy was a president sure definitely people hated him, especially Republicans [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5660.0s)]
*  A lot of people hated him for the Bay of Pigs, but the press didn't hate him [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5665.16s)]
*  You know they they everybody knew who he was right? [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5669.64s)]
*  Not that's not the case today [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5673.64s)]
*  You know the world is such a hostile place today. It's there's we don't have respect for institutions anymore [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5675.8s)]
*  We don't have respect for mainstream media for a lot of fucking reasons [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5682.54s)]
*  We don't have respect for mainstream news we look at them like all right. Maybe this is real right [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5685.88s)]
*  We don't look at it like you take everything that grain is exactly yeah, and we know that there's deep [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5692.04s)]
*  Political agendas in reporting any story in the perspective the editorializing of these these perspectives [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5698.12s)]
*  it's just there's a lot of what humans are is what we're getting influenced by and [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5705.56s)]
*  When you're getting influenced by propaganda and horse shit all the time [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5712.32s)]
*  It has an effect on you whether you like it or not [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5716.72s)]
*  It might not be a hundred percent effective [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5719.94s)]
*  But it has some sort of an effect on you where you're willing to let these people who are just people [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5722.06s)]
*  They're no different than you and no different than me right [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5728.0199999999995s)]
*  But you'll let them talk to you and talk to us as if they are in control of us, right? [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5730.54s)]
*  And that is not supposed to be how America works right and that's just a natural human power structure thing [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5737.42s)]
*  That we've had since we were tribal creatures [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5744.54s)]
*  It's a natural inclination to want to be that and want to do that [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5747.6s)]
*  but we have to protect against that at all costs because just because it seems like you would like those things to be [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5752.04s)]
*  Implemented because they fit your perspective and your worldview the problem is now there's tools in place for tyrants [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5759.400000000001s)]
*  And now there's tools in place for people who don't share your perspective [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5766.68s)]
*  It don't have a charitable view of human beings and are ruthless and maybe psychotic [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5769.84s)]
*  But that's like that's the beginning that's the beginning of it all too [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5775.46s)]
*  Yes [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5779.78s)]
*  It's been happening like Nero and fucking just like Rome was super like everything you look at like [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5780.9800000000005s)]
*  Everything what it was a republic, you know, like everybody was everybody had a vote everybody had to say everybody [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5788.9800000000005s)]
*  But the guys who are running well, everybody was drinking from lead [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5794.62s)]
*  And everybody was like, you know what I mean? [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5799.42s)]
*  This dude built this statue [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5805.5s)]
*  like fucking a hundred feet tall of himself and then Rome set on fucking fire and and it's [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5807.78s)]
*  It's it's crazy and that's just been happening and it's been repeating [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5814.58s)]
*  forever and I don't know exactly how long but you know, the hip history repeats itself and then you look at a cycle of [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5819.02s)]
*  like how civilizations come and and [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5827.86s)]
*  Go this way and it's just like I don't know I know when I was a kid I used to think about America that way [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5830.9400000000005s)]
*  When I was a kid, I was like, well, you know [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5836.42s)]
*  You read about ancient Greece and ancient Rome and these great civilizations that they fell like what happened [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5838.34s)]
*  Did they see it coming and I was like what I see it coming what I know it was coming [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5845.3s)]
*  Is it gonna happen to us? Right? We don't want to ever think it could happen to us as we're on the top [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5849.820000000001s)]
*  We're number one. We're fucking America. We're the youngest fucking country in the fucking world [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5854.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and it can happen to us [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5859.1s)]
*  Oh, you got to be real careful that we don't become just like all these ones that we we talk about when we say boy [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5861.46s)]
*  be glad you're not living in that place because [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5867.26s)]
*  Places go through cycles. Some places are amazing and then they get invaded [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5871.620000000001s)]
*  Some places, you know, so we look at Atlantis. Yeah [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5875.740000000001s)]
*  That one's probably [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5881.660000000001s)]
*  an ocean thing [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5883.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's that's that's probably that's mama nature come yeah, that's probably an [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5885.62s)]
*  Impact thing you believe in Atlantis. Yes. Yes, I do. The thing was a real place you talked about the younger dry [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5891.22s)]
*  I yes, and I was watching a thing recently actually about [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5898.0599999999995s)]
*  How they think that the Egyptians just found the pyramids and the Sphinx and how you can see [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5903.86s)]
*  That the younger dry us [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5911.66s)]
*  Affecting the Sphinx and the pyramids like that and [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5913.94s)]
*  How that shit happened I mean, yeah, I'm not fully as [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5919.22s)]
*  Encompassed as you I'm sure cuz I just now learned about the younger dry [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5924.78s)]
*  But well for sure this is what you can say for sure because this gets people very upset for sure. Yeah [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5928.3s)]
*  Okay, but I don't know why but just you have to kind of like say a few things [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5934.3s)]
*  Okay, one thing is that for sure the Egyptians made it because it was in Egypt [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5937.7s)]
*  Okay, like it's just different yes, sir. It's I think what we're saying is there people from a different era [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5941.62s)]
*  Yes, sir, and this is the whole proposal that Graham Hancock and Randall Carlson have yes, sir in [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5947.0599999999995s)]
*  Like with that younger drys impact theory people get crazy about this and they think it's [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5954.42s)]
*  No, you definitely didn't okay, but there's people that call it a racist theory it's very strange because it's really yeah [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5960.74s)]
*  It's it's real weird and they've applied that to Graham Hancock and it's ridiculous doesn't make any sense [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5966.96s)]
*  He's he's not saying anything about the race of the people that did it. It's about time [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5972.639999999999s)]
*  the whole issue is about time and [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5977.5199999999995s)]
*  What they believe is that somewhere around around 11,000 800 years ago and probably a couple other times we got [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5980.28s)]
*  obliterated by comet impacts comet fragments slammed into the earth [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5988.5599999999995s)]
*  And there's a lot of evidence of this physical evidence of iridium levels of iridium [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5992.72s)]
*  Nanodiamonds that happen on impact this shit is all over the world [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=5997.64s)]
*  You could find giant craters in places where like Greenland and there's places where 100% [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6001.2s)]
*  They got obliterated by a giant chunk of something [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6007.84s)]
*  What they believe is that this ended the ice age and this is what caused all the melting of the the ice caps that were [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6011.16s)]
*  Above North America, and that's where all this massive flooding came from and that's where the Great Lakes [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6017.8s)]
*  come from and he thinks that it was a [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6022.6s)]
*  civilization ending event where very few people survived and they essentially had to rebuild from there and so the amazing [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6025.92s)]
*  Society that built the pyramids whoever those people were [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6034.160000000001s)]
*  By the time this younger dry ice impacting happens [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6038.56s)]
*  Who knows what kind of civilization they had at that point sure but they might have been [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6041.92s)]
*  Far more advanced than us sure just in a different way sure and for sure they knew how to move stone in a way [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6047.08s)]
*  We still don't understand right we have no idea how the fuck they did that no idea how they made [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6053.84s)]
*  2,000,000 [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6059.360000000001s)]
*  300,000 stones meet perfectly at the top and then covered in smooth limestone [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6060.6s)]
*  It's fucking insane channel and channel energy. Yeah, well like and vibrate [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6065.76s)]
*  Inside of the pyramid to channel fucking energy who knows what they were doing [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6071.72s)]
*  It's crazy, and I didn't mean to offend anyone and no no no no no no I shouldn't I shouldn't have said it the way [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6076.5199999999995s)]
*  So I know not at all I just wanted to clarify because it's a weird thing that people keep cuz I just learned about this [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6081.679999999999s)]
*  like and like watching videos about it and [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6086.719999999999s)]
*  Learning about all this stuff in them you got it first off take everything with a grain of salt of course [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6093.04s)]
*  But then it's like fuck it fucking actually crazy, and now there's is there xenon on Mars [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6098.299999999999s)]
*  What is xenon the xenon there's a there's a chemical that [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6104.639999999999s)]
*  So the soil on Mars is supposedly [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6111.879999999999s)]
*  enriched with [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6117.12s)]
*  xenon [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6118.5599999999995s)]
*  Enough to like it's like don't let me I'll just throw out an arbitrary number a thousand megatons of nuclear [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6120.639999999999s)]
*  It comes from nuclear explosions what so and they said that the soil [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6128.36s)]
*  That's that they said that the soil on Mars is super packed with it. Yo imagine Mars [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6133.6s)]
*  There was a nuclear war war on where they imagine they just obliterated the whole planet [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6139.92s)]
*  How do you think how do you feel about the face? [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6146.200000000001s)]
*  It's the problem with the faces it was a very low resolution [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6149.320000000001s)]
*  camera, and it was convenient, and then when they went over to second time it's [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6153.76s)]
*  It's [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6157.84s)]
*  It's weird in the shape of it, but it didn't look like a face anymore [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6159.04s)]
*  So how do you feel about NASA having its own like photoshopping? [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6162.6s)]
*  Branch do they there's people on NASA that Photoshop you know that you look at a picture of Mars what color do you think it is? [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6168.76s)]
*  It's like it's like a dusty tan orange right [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6175.360000000001s)]
*  Would you pull up the real pictures of Mars what they actually look like without the fucking filter on them is am I crazy? [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6179.16s)]
*  What is it out well isn't it like it is crazy different spots that have like different color ground [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6186.56s)]
*  I don't know it so they and they put so you look at pictures of Mars [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6192.04s)]
*  From like 20 to 30 years ago, okay, or whatever and then you look at pictures of Mars now [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6199.120000000001s)]
*  They are drastically different because people caught on to like why are you throwing a filter on? [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6204.52s)]
*  Mars [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6210.92s)]
*  Color Mars yeah interesting [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6213.32s)]
*  I'll pull up the photos. I'm seeing you direct me to what it is look at that one look at that one like this one [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6217.56s)]
*  That's no the first one. Oh no third one. Sorry sir [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6224.32s)]
*  Like on the ground look at the sky there, okay? [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6228.84s)]
*  Look at the sky there look at the ground there, and then look at the the second one even for in fact [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6233.08s)]
*  There's an orange tint to everything on every picture that we've ever seen of it [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6238.56s)]
*  But then if you look at it look up maybe Mars without the filter [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6244.4800000000005s)]
*  But the lunar module doesn't look orange look at the lunar module. It's pure white. It's just a filter. It's not pure white [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6249.160000000001s)]
*  Okay, look at that like that looks just like Earth [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6255.56s)]
*  It looks like a place on Earth that could be a place on Earth totally right except for this the sky is a little fucked up [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6259.280000000001s)]
*  Looking let's do [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6265.6s)]
*  Let's do my photo shop [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6267.8s)]
*  Instance I don't know what do you call like a like I keep saying branch [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6273.240000000001s)]
*  But like it's like well [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6276.360000000001s)]
*  I do know that just one way to explain some of it is that a lot of the photos they get from the telescopes are [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6277.68s)]
*  Like not actual you know like like with these cameras. It's not just taking a photo sure it's taking data that has to be [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6282.92s)]
*  Compiled sure photo sure and are these not from the rover though. They are I'm not talking about like landscape photos [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6289.4800000000005s)]
*  I [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6297.4s)]
*  Mean, but wouldn't it make sense that Mars looks different in different spots and wouldn't it make sense that it looks different with different [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6299.08s)]
*  Conditions like it certainly does Mars is not that yeah [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6306.08s)]
*  That's what I'm talking about the photo like that for instance can't be taken normally right right but like the landscape photos [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6309.08s)]
*  It looks like a space monkey look at that. That dude's chill as fuck. Is that a real photo Jamie? [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6316.44s)]
*  That picture looks like a space monkey the picture that you just had up [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6323.400000000001s)]
*  Look at that cool. That's your new doesn't it logo [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6327.040000000001s)]
*  Photoshop NASA photos give new life to outer space imagery. Yeah [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6330.68s)]
*  So if you were one of these NASA Photoshop [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6338.280000000001s)]
*  You would manipulate the photos in a little bit of a way to make them look a little more extraordinary [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6341.160000000001s)]
*  Well, there's well there's something we talk about lying it no it's crazy [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6346.4400000000005s)]
*  I'm trying to use the right words here because like I can make if I can take a photo of you Joe and make it [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6351.84s)]
*  Look, you know or both of you either. I could you put like the handsome filter [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6356.64s)]
*  You can make the look away [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6362.280000000001s)]
*  It didn't really look to anybody's eyes in the room right, but you can just tweak some things without adding really anything. You're just tweaking [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6365.12s)]
*  The light off the sensors and then there's but there are ways you can go way further with it [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6371.72s)]
*  I don't alright, so I was I've been I mean you can [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6375.92s)]
*  Fucking trust YouTube as far as you can throw it but [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6380.320000000001s)]
*  Looking at photos of recent photos of Mars and it could it could be camera. It could be camera [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6384.96s)]
*  Well, if you look at a photo from like a Samsung Galaxy Note 2, but it still doesn't change the color [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6392.52s)]

*  That's also could be what we're used to seeing and it just make gives a better context [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6422.820000000001s)]

*  Evidence for large natural natural nuclear reactor in Mars past. Why are they saying natural? They're just guessing [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6458.58s)]
*  They don't want to say that maybe it was a civilization that nuked itself into oblivion. Maybe so yeah [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6466.34s)]

*  And so we would go use their parking garage whenever it would hail [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6719.66s)]
*  And so we see windows gonna get smashed. Yeah, cuz it's it's crazy. Yeah fuck your car crazy [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6724.7s)]
*  There's a see if you can find the video Jamie of hailstorm in swimming pool. It's bananas. It's like they're getting attacked [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6731.26s)]
*  It's like missiles are coming in into their swimming pool. It's fucking where's that? [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6738.42s)]

*  Texas can I 10-1? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry guys go ahead. Look at this though. Please fucking hail. Oh [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6746.900000000001s)]
*  My god, yeah that poor cow that poor cow [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6754.62s)]
*  That cows getting lit up that swimming pool is getting rocked [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6759.5s)]
*  We'll pause we'll pause you real quick. I'll tinkle to we're right back folks and [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6764.9800000000005s)]
*  We're back [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6770.34s)]
*  Ah [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6772.7s)]
*  So you say you got into archery or he tried it I tried it I tried it. Yes, sir. Where'd you go? I? [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6773.900000000001s)]
*  was in France, so I was in France working on the wine and [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6781.26s)]
*  We were at the vineyard and we were like, let's shoot some [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6786.46s)]
*  Shoot some boats. So we had some French archers [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6790.54s)]
*  come out and [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6793.58s)]
*  they had like [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6795.26s)]
*  They had a compound and they had like just another like recurve like traditional like yeah and [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6796.78s)]
*  Joe Rogan that is hard to do. It's not easy to do it [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6804.7s)]
*  It's not easy to do it all and they want you to go forward. Do you go forward when you shoot? [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6808.42s)]
*  No, they told you go forward. Yeah, maybe with that. Maybe it was with like was it like an old oak bow [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6813.099999999999s)]
*  Okay, a long bow. Yeah, so they like [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6820.38s)]
*  Told you to go for whatever it to help your aim [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6823.86s)]
*  Which seems counterintuitive because you don't want to really move when you're well though [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6827.259999999999s)]
*  The whole thing about those old bows when it's whether it's a recurve or a long bow [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6831.94s)]
*  Is that it's much more of a feel thing? [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6837.36s)]
*  Like you kind of you have to practice with them a lot almost like throwing a rock, right if you throw a rock [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6840.66s)]
*  Or a baseball is a better example when you throw a baseball [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6847.179999999999s)]
*  You know how far how much energy you have to put into that throw in order to get into that strike zone [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6850.1s)]
*  If you're throwing a pitch, right? So that's like a knowledge of how much force and how you can aim [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6857.46s)]
*  This is the same thing applies to arrows you shoot enough arrows [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6863.900000000001s)]
*  You know like where you have to hold. Thank you, sir [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6867.3s)]
*  At what distance when you're releasing an arrow because you know the arc of the arrow and you feel its feel its feel [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6870.120000000001s)]
*  Compound archery what I do is very different. It's much more calculated. I have a rangefinder [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6877.16s)]
*  It's having me 52 yards. I dial it on my my sight to 50 years [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6882.64s)]
*  My pin moves up and down and then I'm holding so you have Picatinny on your bow [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6887.4800000000005s)]
*  What's a picatinny rail in the front? Yes, I do cool. Yeah, so you put like an aim point [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6892.360000000001s)]
*  Well, this is where that's where the sight comes out of the site is [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6897.68s)]
*  Okay, are you laughing well, I don't use an optic okay you use a you use a [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6902.4800000000005s)]
*  It's just a clear hole like a tube with a fiber optic pin in it [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6906.96s)]
*  Okay [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6912.28s)]
*  And that fiber optic pin is the indicator that tells you what yardage like if it's up or down, right? [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6912.68s)]
*  So if it's up, that means it's a close shot if it's down very low. It means a long shot [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6918.400000000001s)]
*  So it's the arc of the arrow over a course of time and it's all calculated on this thing called archers advantage [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6922.8s)]
*  Which is a computer program? [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6928.6s)]
*  Okay, so you put in the speed of the bow the weight of the arrow all these different factors and you put it in and it'll [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6929.8s)]
*  Give you a sight tape nerd and then yeah [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6935.04s)]
*  And like you you dial it into 20 yards once you know where 20 yards is you got that indicator mark you mark it off [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6939.6s)]
*  And then you put the tape down and then once you put that tape down [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6945.320000000001s)]
*  You're good to go to like a hundred yards 110 yards wherever you want. You just do your hold there [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6948.56s)]
*  Exactly, just hold where that pin is [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6953.56s)]
*  It's a much easier way of shooting a bow than traditional but you do you have a laser rangefinder? [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6955.08s)]
*  Yes, who makes a rangefinder? Oh, but shit ton of companies [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6961.2s)]
*  I could it's it the same is like a like a firearm rangefinder [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6964.64s)]
*  Yes, very simple very similar a lot of the same companies like, you know vortex. Yeah, they make a great rangefinder [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6968.0s)]
*  I use a loop hold a full draw five because it actually tells you you put in the [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6974.28s)]
*  The arrow speed and all these different factors and it actually shows you the arc of the arrow in the rangefinder [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6979.12s)]
*  So like if I'm trying to shoot an elk through a pocket in the trees [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6985.16s)]
*  It's like this big and I'm 35 yards away [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6988.88s)]
*  I have to know that my arrow is not gonna hit the upper branches sure so I can because at the height of the arrow [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6991.48s)]
*  It's higher than when it's gonna drop down [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6996.64s)]
*  So you're putting the pin where it wants to drop down [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=6998.6s)]
*  But it might be like way up here when it's at five yards ten yards 15 yards [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7001.2s)]
*  And then it's gonna drop down into that spot exactly where you want it to go so this rangefinder [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7005.48s)]
*  How big is what the rangefinder? It's a little it's like like a phone phone size. It's like that's it right there [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7011.16s)]
*  So I have a like I said, I have a foot. It's called a loop hold full draw five, but I have a vortex one [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7017.599999999999s)]
*  It's great, too [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7022.98s)]
*  It just doesn't have that thing where you can the reason why I use the full draw five is that line is gigantic [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7023.5599999999995s)]
*  If you're shooting through obstacles and through branches because a lot of times an elk will be in an opening [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7028.719999999999s)]
*  Like there's two trees and you know they're like five feet wide, but this is like this one branch [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7035.0599999999995s)]
*  That's above him, and you have to do that's it see so that line right there [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7039.74s)]
*  It shows that you're okay the height of the arrow so like right there that in my mind [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7043.5s)]
*  I would think that could hit that branch and is that your hold there are you aiming for that spot? [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7048.74s)]
*  No, no, no the hold is where the crosshairs [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7053.179999999999s)]
*  Okay, okay, and what that's indicative that that line at the top is indicative the very height of your arrow when this at its [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7055.099999999999s)]
*  Highest point so that was a long shot. That's 78 yards [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7060.7s)]
*  There's a little unethical a little unethical [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7065.139999999999s)]
*  It's a long long poke for sure but real elite archers can do it if you're like you know a cam Hanes [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7067.66s)]
*  That's that's a shot that he can take unethical because you might for a knee or something. I might fuck that shot [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7073.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I wouldn't take that shot [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7079.259999999999s)]
*  But I but I would on a big animal like a buffalo or something like that you have you know that the vitals are this big [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7080.86s)]
*  You know have you ever shot or? [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7087.86s)]
*  What do you call it? [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7090.9s)]
*  Shooting archery like what do you say when I say shooting shooting have you ever shot under like night vision and nods? [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7092.66s)]
*  No, that would be wild, but I have a hard time. I do you'd have a hard time [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7099.46s)]
*  Seeing like you wouldn't hold see like the thing about archery is and it's one of the beautiful things about it is like everything's [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7105.26s)]
*  Repeatable like you you have to have perfect form so like when I come to full draw [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7113.0599999999995s)]
*  My [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7117.9s)]
*  String touches the tip of my nose [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7118.86s)]
*  The this is in the corner of the the the D loop is in the corner of my mouth [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7121.22s)]
*  Did they ever fuck you up my knuckle is exactly where this where my jaw lines up? [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7125.7s)]
*  That's where my knuckle sits. It's a repeatable point sure if I have nods on is [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7130.9800000000005s)]
*  It's not gonna work right. It's I can't even do it with glasses [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7136.26s)]
*  I don't even like it with glasses on it feels weird [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7139.42s)]
*  It's a it's like I have to be lined up with that string and when I'm lined up with that string all [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7141.42s)]
*  I don't think about a fucking thing in the world all I think about is releasing a perfect arrow [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7146.86s)]
*  That's all I'm thinking about I'm not thinking about taxes. I need gas [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7153.0599999999995s)]

*  All I'm thinking of is that spot that I'm aiming at and I think there's a [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7161.54s)]
*  Mind-cleansing thing yeah that comes from that and the release of it [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7166.099999999999s)]
*  It's got to feel like it's so fucking good like cuz I tried the hardest part for me was getting that [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7169.36s)]
*  Bowback and holding yes holding that string yeah like [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7176.78s)]
*  That was the heart it takes a lot of shoulder takes a lot of arm my body's imbalanced [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7182.099999999999s)]

*  Fucking hundred times a day. Yeah every day. It's like these muscle. I really have to balance it out [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7197.179999999999s)]
*  I feel it sometimes. Well that's the same thing but from jacking off [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7201.92s)]
*  Just which hands yeah, well stranger [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7207.38s)]

*  I was like you know what and plus it the first couple times shooting were you scared of [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7214.76s)]
*  Shooting a bow yeah, it feels that is so snappy and when I was a kid [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7221.639999999999s)]
*  I had like a little fake bow and that's why I get the wrist guard [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7225.8s)]
*  Yes, because that shit comes and it blew my arm up it blew my arm up [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7229.82s)]
*  We should see what compound bows do compound bow so if you're pulling back like an 80 pound bow [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7235.7s)]
*  And you have all this force on those cams when that string comes and fucking slices against your forearm people get some gnarly [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7241.179999999999s)]

*  They're all really good at the highest level. I shoot with a Hoyt, but there's a company called [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7277.94s)]
*  PSE they make a great bows company called Matthews [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7283.38s)]
*  They make a great bow bear makes great bow if you're gonna survive in the archery world [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7286.099999999999s)]
*  The archery world is very unique in that there's yearly innovation so Hoyt puts out new bows every year [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7290.52s)]
*  It's like an iPhone engineers that are constantly tweaking things and they have pro staff guys like cam Haynes [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7297.84s)]
*  There's a professional archer those guys they all work sweet man, too. He's the best. He's the nicest guy on earth, right? [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7304.040000000001s)]
*  But those guys give them feedback and talk about this is what I like. This is what I want [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7309.76s)]
*  Can you change this can change that and then every year they get a little better every fucking year? [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7315.280000000001s)]
*  They get like incrementally better. Do you run like a weight on yours? [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7320.32s)]
*  Yeah, is that what those long stabilized things are the stabilizers on there when you have a weight out front it like it keeps [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7323.92s)]
*  Balance a little bit better, and this is hard you that's not to fucking mention pulling the yeah, I mean [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7331.28s)]
*  Keeping your arms. It's heavy. Yeah, it's not light. No you have to develop a [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7337.599999999999s)]
*  Certain amount of rigidity in your your form, you know [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7342.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that comes from practice. You just have to practice a lot [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7347.2s)]
*  Archery is one of those things where you really like my friend John Dudley who's one of the best archery coaches alive [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7350.679999999999s)]
*  He practices hours every day puts it up on his Instagram puts his little lessons up on his YouTube [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7356.24s)]
*  He's shooting arrows out in his yard. He's a giant range [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7362.639999999999s)]
*  It goes out to like 150 yards or something and he's shooting out there [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7366.0s)]
*  Every day hours and hours and hours a day. That's why he's so good. There's no shortcuts [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7370.2s)]
*  Yeah to figuring out how to be good at that it just takes constant repetitive practice over and over again a focus and technique [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7376.04s)]
*  So what do you think of those guys that can shoot like three arrows? It's pretty wild. It's cool. It's fucking super cool [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7383.6s)]
*  It's cool. Look, there's a guy that like there's like wall. Yeah [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7390.2s)]
*  I think he's revitalized that whole idea [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7394.28s)]
*  Because I think for a long time they thought that people carried arrows in their quiver and they pulled one out right and he's like [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7398.36s)]
*  No, there's a lot of like ancient depictions the treatises in ancient times of guys holding three or four arrows in their hand [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7404.96s)]
*  He thinks that's what they did. I mean, that's what's so that's what's so interesting. Like you look at like HEMA [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7412.4s)]
*  like like the [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7418.28s)]
*  European martial arts or whatever and they like get in the armor with the training swords and shit [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7422.4800000000005s)]
*  And they're like all they can do is interpret these [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7427.88s)]
*  Treatises that they had and the shit that they wrote down like all the different guards and like the way that they would actually fight [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7432.72s)]
*  right like [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7440.0s)]
*  Because there's no video there's no real tutorial on how to do it [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7441.68s)]
*  Right, you have to interpret this stuff. Good luck finding a dude who's won a sword fight. Yeah, it's exactly [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7446.2s)]

*  Multiplier well also would you be allowed to have spiked shoes and now that would come into play [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7548.36s)]
*  Maybe you get paid less for the spike shoes [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7554.5599999999995s)]
*  Gives you too much of an advantage [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7557.12s)]
*  Or maybe everybody wears them. Maybe it's just the thing you wear [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7559.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7563.28s)]
*  Ice fights with spiked shoes move someone goes down to get stomped spike shoes [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7565.28s)]
*  You remember [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7570.4s)]
*  But if you win you don't get any prize money [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7576.0s)]
*  Wait eye gouging is a this don't include biting [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7579.24s)]
*  It says is in occurrence of victory that if you win by eye gouge, but look they still allow biting this don't include biting [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7583.28s)]
*  Even when they wrote it this don't include biting eye gouging still permitted, but you don't get paid [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7590.04s)]
*  That's from this bro, and I have you know this just don't include biting guys. Yeah, it's biting is still cool [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7595.280000000001s)]
*  What the fuck man biting that's fucking crazy. That's fucking crazy was so was like UFC like one and two [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7601.92s)]
*  How when did the gloves come in? [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7609.240000000001s)]
*  Well some guys started wearing gloves on their own like Vitor Belfort is UFC 12. What a beast [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7612.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that was the first fight that I have worked [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7617.74s)]
*  Vitor was one of the first guys to show up with gloves on he might have been the first it was hit [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7620.66s)]
*  No, no tank Abbott was the first [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7624.82s)]
*  I think tank Abbot was the first guy to wear gloves because he realized that those little tiny gloves are only protecting his hands [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7626.34s)]
*  Right now really protect especially when you hit his right tank Abbott [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7632.66s)]
*  And tank Abbott just went out flatline people those gloves on because you can really crack someone if you have your hands taped up nice [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7635.78s)]
*  And you have your wrists taped up nice and you have padding over your knuckles [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7641.74s)]
*  You can really fucking crack someone yeah, but it's hard to do that with just your hands well even doing I [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7645.7s)]
*  Never I thought the tape was to look here's tank which one UFC six, so he's definitely the first [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7653.74s)]
*  Yeah, thanks. That dude's got a shirt on bro. Yeah, you could do whatever you want [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7659.9s)]
*  Yeah, choose on their shoes tank was fucking those. This is one of the craziest knockouts ever because look how he stiffens up [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7663.78s)]
*  And then tank mocks him he like [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7671.38s)]
*  That's [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7674.62s)]
*  Yeah, dude tank was a he had no mouthguard in or anything well [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7675.9s)]
*  He might have might have got knocked out, but that's crazy [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7679.78s)]
*  Yeah, and I never realized I thought the tape was just to look cool tape yeah on your hands. Yeah wrists [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7682.86s)]
*  Yeah, oh, it's to protect your hand 100% because I did a fight scene [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7689.62s)]
*  for [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7694.179999999999s)]
*  an upcoming film and [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7695.82s)]
*  I just was my hands and even [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7698.299999999999s)]
*  Pretending to hit I had to fight a guy. He was like [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7701.7s)]
*  Massive like big-ass buff dude like 300 pounds are just pure fucking and like hitting him [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7704.9800000000005s)]
*  He was like all right. Give it to me. Yeah, and then so I I wouldn't punch him full force, but I would hit him like [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7712.38s)]
*  20% and even then I was like oh my fucking god my wrist is like fucked [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7718.1s)]
*  And I'm not a fighter by any means, but we put the tape on and it just it was so much more like stable [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7722.88s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's the whole reason for it. I just thought I look cool. It does look cool [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7728.92s)]
*  It doesn't look cool. It definitely looks cool [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7733.38s)]
*  No, it's 100% to protect your hand and your wrist risk it wrists are very fragile [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7735.8s)]
*  Canelo Alvarez just fucked his wrist up. He had to get surgery on his wrist [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7740.56s)]
*  He's a beast. He's a beast. He's a beast. He's a beast like I'm I'm I'm [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7744.4s)]
*  Talking more about Jake I [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7750.84s)]
*  Want to see a UFC fight? [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7753.64s)]
*  You want to see UFC fight with Jake yeah, well he's not gonna fight for the UFC well no [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7756.280000000001s)]
*  He's got a contract with the PFL which is another organization [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7762.12s)]
*  They're throwing a lot of money around they just signed Francis and Ghanu and Jake has a contract with them [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7765.96s)]
*  So if he has an MMA fight, I think it has to be over there [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7771.200000000001s)]
*  Where's that? [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7774.6s)]
*  PFL PFL yeah, I haven't watched the PFL. It's good good fights good fighters. They got a lot of elite guys [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7775.88s)]
*  It's like, you know a B level organization terms of there's only really one a level organization in America, right? [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7782.64s)]
*  No, that's the UFC right. The other ones are just slightly below but there's a elite guys and all of those [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7788.96s)]
*  There's elite guys in Bellator that could compete in the UFC, right? [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7794.320000000001s)]
*  There's elite guys in the PFL and what is that just contracting? It's like new contract. Mm-hmm shit like yeah [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7797.72s)]
*  Yeah, like that's what happened with Francis and Ghanu because he was the UFC heavyweight champion didn't lose his title [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7804.320000000001s)]
*  He relinquished his title due to contract negotiations and he decided he was gonna leave and so they vacate [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7808.76s)]
*  He vacated the title and they gave him a big chunk of money to go to the PFL, right? [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7814.64s)]
*  I gotta watch the PFL fight. Yeah, there's good fights [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7818.2s)]
*  It's got a wacky point system that you're not gonna understand cuz I don't understand [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7821.280000000001s)]
*  I don't understand any points in in [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7825.68s)]
*  UFC or or boxing. Oh, like when they like it's like a 10-9 round like that kind of thing because I'm like well [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7829.0s)]
*  You you watch and I know albeit I know nothing about [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7835.400000000001s)]
*  Fighting but I'm like that dude definitely won that round but it always seems [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7839.24s)]
*  to be so [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7845.360000000001s)]
*  close [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7847.68s)]
*  kind of [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7848.84s)]
*  But it's always like unanimous decision is [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7850.12s)]
*  Whenever the judges all agree. Yeah, it's all the same, right? [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7854.320000000001s)]
*  But I don't I don't quite understand the whole deal. I don't understand [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7859.08s)]
*  So what are they going off of knockdowns is a big one knockdowns a big one punches landed is a big one [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7862.96s)]
*  Uh-huh. So what is the ratio? So here let's take a look at that [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7868.36s)]
*  What is the ratio between punches thrown and punches landed? How does that affect points? [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7871.44s)]
*  Well, it doesn't if you still land a lot and you miss a lot like so if you're a highly active fighter throws like 150 punches [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7876.92s)]
*  Around and you land 50 and your opponent only lands 10, but they only threw 30, right? [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7883.96s)]
*  You still won that round right you just let a lot more volume a lot more but even though you missing your [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7889.28s)]
*  What counts is how many you land if you don't get penalized for missing for missing? [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7895.0s)]
*  Okay, okay [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7899.48s)]
*  If you're a guy who just throws a lot of fucking punches [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7900.16s)]
*  You're gonna miss a lot of punches too [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7902.28s)]
*  If you just if you have some insane cardio and you just go after a guy throw insane volume at him [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7903.4s)]
*  Well, you take a hundred percent of the shots you miss isn't that saying [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7909.0s)]
*  You miss 100% of shots you don't take [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7913.48s)]
*  But you do take a hundred percent of shots you miss too [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7916.66s)]
*  Pessimistic version a little bit but it is true a hundred percent of the times you missed you took a shot [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7922.34s)]
*  That's true [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7928.82s)]
*  That's unavoidable my buddy told me that that's amazing. It's like that's amazing. Nobody wants to think about that [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7931.0599999999995s)]
*  No one thinks about that [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7938.5s)]
*  You gotta go for a lot of people go for it. They said they said Michael Jordan said that [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7940.62s)]
*  Did he and then Michael Jordan didn't say that you might have said it forgot [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7945.66s)]
*  You might have been in a competitive trend you miss a hundred. Oh, it's Wayne Gretzky [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7949.3s)]
*  You miss a hundred ways. That's Michael Scott [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7953.88s)]
*  Michael Scott's probably one of the most legendary characters of all time [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7962.18s)]
*  How about the fact that that guy went on to play that creepy du Pont guy in that movie? [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7965.38s)]

*  Steve Carell kills it in that movie. It's a really good movie man [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=7999.82s)]
*  It's so there's some fucked up things about that movie like historical inaccuracies because it has to do with the some real wrestlers [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=8003.74s)]
*  and he took some liberties with the story short, but [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=8009.66s)]
*  Steve Carell nails it if you just want to just see it as a movie. Yeah, I think about it being yeah, whether it's accurate [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=8012.42s)]
*  Yeah, cuz I'm totally clueless about it. It's interesting. It's just crazy that that's the guy from the office [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=8019.179999999999s)]

*  The break your leg in the wolf's name is Elsa. She's so cute check it out [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=8711.019999999999s)]
*  I think at one point in time a guy tries to climb down. He falls and the wolves get him [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=8715.42s)]
*  There's a bunch of scenes like it's boiler. It's that shit like that. Yeah, this is it [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=8721.46s)]
*  So the they get stuck [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=8726.74s)]
*  Fuck that yeah, and then the wolves come out [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=8729.619999999999s)]

*  Shut up [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=8762.32s)]
*  Have you ever been on a ski lift and it stops, I'm just why how would you be stuck though somewhat I [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=8767.16s)]
*  Like how they tried it. I like how they tried to add impact in the trailer to the word to I think [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=8772.08s)]
*  Were like someone knew somebody and they let them in and then no one knew that they were on the lift [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=8782.279999999999s)]
*  Because they were the last one they weren't supposed to be skiing [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=8788.08s)]
*  But there were some kids they snuck in they got on the lift and no one knew they were on the lift [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=8791.12s)]
*  So when it stopped no one knew no one knew there's people on it [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=8795.72s)]
*  They just left that was my biggest fear to getting lost in like the Walmart and my mom was gone [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=8798.92s)]
*  Like she left me there and there was no one there [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=8803.880000000001s)]
*  But now that I'm older I realize how badass that would be to be stuck in a Walmart with no one there [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=8806.36s)]
*  That would be like the funnest time ever if you could get over your anxiety the fact that you were stuck in a Walmart [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=8813.359999999999s)]
*  If I was just my age, I'm 28 and I told my 10 year old self is like good you run away from your mom right now [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=8819.24s)]
*  You get stuck in the fucking Walmart [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=8827.199999999999s)]
*  You stay under a shelf until everyone leaves and then you can just fucking go run around and they always give you shit about [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=8829.279999999999s)]
*  playing with the balls [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=8835.32s)]
*  The balls in the pen not like your balls, right? [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=8837.88s)]
*  They do they give you shit about playing with your balls in Walmart to [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=8841.36s)]
*  Whenever you take the big balls out of the thing, you know what I'm talking about now they close them up [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=8845.28s)]
*  Yeah, they close them up [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=8850.76s)]
*  So the kids don't play with them because you don't got to buy it [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=8852.08s)]
*  You just take it out and play with it the whole time you're in Walmart, right? [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=8855.08s)]
*  And they don't like kids playing at Walmart. They don't want kids playing sales. Are you kidding me? [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=8858.92s)]
*  No one I can't tell you how many times I walk into a Walmart and I see a bunch of kids fucking having fun and [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=8863.48s)]
*  I'm just like I'm out [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=8868.92s)]
*  Yeah, what would be the [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=8873.199999999999s)]
*  Negative effect of kids playing at Walmart. I have to fucking leave man. There's too many kids playing around [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=8874.96s)]
*  I guess the only negative would be like if somebody wanted to buy the ball the kid was playing with Joe [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=8879.96s)]
*  you know there are [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=8885.92s)]
*  People that would get pissed about sure because these kids would throw them at like the old lady and she'd freak out [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=8889.119999999999s)]
*  You know, that's true, especially we've seen we've seen the Karen montages. Yeah [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=8895.880000000001s)]

*  They're stuck with that. It's crazy how names like that [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=8912.12s)]
*  Now that we're in this phase no one in this generation will name their daughter Karen [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=8917.72s)]
*  Probably not. Yeah, I would like to see like how many people were named Karen in the year [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=8925.199999999999s)]
*  2022 [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=8931.08s)]

*  I bet there's thousands sub 10 [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=8938.039999999999s)]
*  Oh, you gotta wonder name Karen and Karen's are the type of girl to name their daughter Karen, too. She's Karen, Jr [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=8939.96s)]

*  It's like cuz I was like, wow, this is a original movie. Like no one's ever done a movie like this before [[02:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=9079.0s)]

*  But at the end of it I was like, how did people get outraged at that? [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=9091.44s)]
*  Like it make they were saying it's and I know some people personally said it's anti-men. I'm like, no, it's it's making fun of dorks [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=9095.0s)]
*  It's it's making fun. It's fun. It's you didn't think it was fun [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=9101.960000000001s)]
*  Like if that was a real person that happening to them is that fun? Well, Margo and Ryan are just like [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=9105.92s)]
*  Amazing amazing together. I'm not moving too. I have to see it. I want to see it [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=9111.76s)]

*  Are we gonna do this thing where we put all men as men? It's one category [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=9124.0s)]
*  We're not gonna judge people as individuals, right? [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=9129.64s)]
*  We're gonna pretend that these individual in this milk who are clearly dorks because they're designed it's fun [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=9132.199999999999s)]
*  That you don't think like what happens to them and the way it happens isn't like fun [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=9137.279999999999s)]
*  Like I don't understand like why people think that represents all men. It's the dumbest the dumbest sort [[02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=9142.800000000001s)]
*  How does it like how what what is what was that? So the you said it's like an anti-man [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=9148.6s)]
*  they think it's a super woke movie and I [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=9153.76s)]
*  Just that's the way to make that fucking movie [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=9157.960000000001s)]
*  It's also a movie about how Barbies are the the dolls that everyone cares about and Ken is just a fucking accessory [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=9161.02s)]
*  Which is real so when you bring these things into a movie you make them real-life [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=9167.76s)]
*  Barbie land right that's how they have to be because that's how it is in the real world [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=9172.48s)]
*  like that's the movie right and then the movie they go to the real world the werewolf sucks and it's run by men and [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=9175.800000000001s)]
*  So this is what people are saying makes this an anti-man concept [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=9181.24s)]
*  It's like fucking fun movie, man. I don't get it. I just I'm [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=9186.72s)]

*  I could see if you it wasn't your kind of movie [[02:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=9198.32s)]
*  But that's anything that someone means well to be honest to be fair about that like it's also like [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=9200.880000000001s)]

*  As you're walking towards the stage [[02:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10338.08s)]
*  Him on that stage in 1983 [[02:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10340.08s)]
*  And [[02:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10342.08s)]
*  Someone apparently [[02:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10344.08s)]
*  I need to find this out [[02:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10346.08s)]
*  Google murder at the Ritz theater [[02:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10348.08s)]
*  Because people that know [[02:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10352.08s)]
*  The building are now telling [[02:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10354.08s)]
*  Me that [[02:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10356.08s)]
*  At one point in time someone was murdered there [[02:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10358.08s)]
*  On the second floor [[02:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10360.08s)]
*  Supposedly [[02:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10362.08s)]
*  I didn't even look it up [[02:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10364.08s)]
*  But I am bringing in ghost hunters [[02:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10366.08s)]
*  To the building [[02:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10368.08s)]
*  Who? [[02:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10370.08s)]
*  Sam and Colby [[02:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10372.08s)]
*  Those guys on YouTube [[02:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10374.08s)]
*  I've had them on the podcast before [[02:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10376.08s)]
*  They're kids [[02:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10378.08s)]
*  They go to these houses [[02:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10380.08s)]
*  I've been working [[02:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10382.08s)]
*  It took me fucking 28 years [[02:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10384.08s)]
*  To grow this god damn it Joe Bro [[02:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10386.08s)]
*  That's a real beard [[02:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10388.08s)]
*  I'm waiting for it to close up [[02:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10390.08s)]
*  But I'm going to have these guys bring in their equipment [[02:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10392.08s)]
*  And go in there late at night [[02:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10394.08s)]
*  And see what they find [[02:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10396.08s)]
*  I haven't had anybody say that they've had [[02:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10398.08s)]
*  Anything weird happen yet [[02:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10400.08s)]
*  But the building feels like it knows you're there [[02:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10402.08s)]
*  It's like charged [[02:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10404.08s)]
*  Well it's old [[02:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10406.08s)]
*  I think that things [[02:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10408.08s)]
*  Contain memories [[02:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10410.08s)]
*  I think that's why people don't want to buy a house where someone was murdered in it [[02:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10412.08s)]
*  It's a stone tape theory [[02:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10414.08s)]
*  I'll show you a theory [[02:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10416.08s)]
*  Give me it [[02:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10418.08s)]
*  It's just that [[02:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10420.08s)]
*  Shit imprints [[02:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10422.08s)]
*  With energy [[02:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10424.08s)]
*  And history [[02:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10426.08s)]
*  I think that's totally true [[02:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10428.08s)]
*  You can walk into a place [[02:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10430.08s)]
*  You walk into a new house [[02:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10432.08s)]
*  And it feels empty as fuck [[02:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10434.08s)]
*  But you walk into an old house [[02:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10436.08s)]
*  And you're like [[02:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10438.08s)]
*  And that could just be [[02:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10440.08s)]
*  This is an old house [[02:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10442.08s)]
*  Fuck, there's got to be some history here [[02:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10444.08s)]
*  This is a new house, there's no history here [[02:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10446.08s)]
*  This is completely Blake Slade [[02:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10448.08s)]
*  But [[02:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10450.08s)]
*  You feel it [[02:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10452.08s)]
*  You feel it, you're like there's some shit that [[02:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10454.08s)]
*  Happened here, whether good or bad [[02:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10456.08s)]
*  Or just families and families that had a [[02:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10458.08s)]
*  Natural family progression [[02:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10460.08s)]
*  Or a fucking house where [[02:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10462.08s)]
*  The [[02:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10464.08s)]
*  Daughter whatever murdered everybody with an axe [[02:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10466.08s)]
*  Whatever, you know [[02:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10468.08s)]
*  But there's always [[02:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10470.08s)]
*  I don't know, you feel shit [[02:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10472.08s)]
*  It's totally possible [[02:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10474.08s)]
*  That some of these things contain some kind of memory [[02:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10476.08s)]
*  Or some kind of feeling to them [[02:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10478.08s)]
*  Something [[02:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10480.08s)]
*  That's one of the [[02:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10482.08s)]
*  Interesting things about [[02:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10484.08s)]
*  When you're in the woods [[02:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10486.08s)]
*  Is the indifference that you feel [[02:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10488.08s)]
*  You feel nature's indifference [[02:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10490.08s)]
*  To you, that's one of the more humbling [[02:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10492.08s)]
*  Things, that makes people feel uneasy [[02:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10494.08s)]
*  Very uneasy, but it's also because [[02:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10496.08s)]
*  You stepped [[02:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10498.08s)]
*  Into a world [[02:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10500.08s)]
*  That is just tooth and claw [[02:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10502.08s)]
*  Fucking eat you alive [[02:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10504.08s)]
*  And they're eating things around you all the time [[02:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10506.08s)]
*  That's exactly how population [[02:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10508.08s)]
*  Is controlled, there's predators around you [[02:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10510.08s)]
*  All the time [[02:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10512.08s)]
*  Eyes front [[02:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10514.08s)]
*  There's an indifference to [[02:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10516.08s)]
*  When you're in the mountains, there's this feeling of indifference [[02:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10518.08s)]
*  That the mountains have to you [[02:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10520.08s)]
*  That's very humbling, it's very centering [[02:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10522.08s)]
*  That's just like whoa [[02:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10524.08s)]
*  Going to Utah and seeing the mountains, I'm like fuck dude [[02:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10526.08s)]
*  I'm a fucking [[02:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10528.08s)]
*  I'm a bug [[02:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10530.08s)]
*  I'm a fucking everything, in the grand scheme of the universe [[02:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10532.08s)]
*  I'm an amoeba [[02:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10534.08s)]
*  I'm so fucking small [[02:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10536.08s)]
*  And try and be fucking [[02:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10538.08s)]
*  As cool as you fucking can to people [[02:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10540.08s)]
*  Be nice [[02:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10542.08s)]
*  Yeah, you have control over that [[02:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10544.08s)]
*  Exactly, that's the only thing you have control over [[02:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10546.08s)]
*  Is how you treat other people [[02:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10548.08s)]
*  It's the only thing [[02:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10550.08s)]
*  And how you treat yourself [[02:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10552.08s)]
*  That's a big one too, like some people they treat other people [[02:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10554.08s)]
*  So well, and then they get someone in their life that really shouldn't be in their life [[02:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10556.08s)]
*  And it's ruining it [[02:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10558.08s)]
*  And they don't treat themselves well by extracting themselves from the situation [[02:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10560.08s)]
*  There's that too [[02:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10564.08s)]
*  But those mountains [[02:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10566.08s)]
*  The woods, the mountains [[02:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10568.08s)]
*  It's just like fuck [[02:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10570.08s)]
*  It makes you think about that shit [[02:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10572.08s)]
*  That's why you see like [[02:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10574.08s)]
*  The tail of the fucking hermit [[02:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10576.08s)]
*  That is the smartest person you'll ever fucking meet [[02:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10578.08s)]
*  But never sees anyone [[02:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10580.08s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10582.08s)]
*  It's just like [[02:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10584.08s)]
*  There's a beauty to that [[02:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10586.08s)]
*  That part of the world [[02:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10588.08s)]
*  Especially mountains for some reason [[02:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10590.08s)]
*  There's a beauty like when the sun is coming up [[02:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10592.08s)]
*  And the sun is shining through the trees [[02:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10594.08s)]
*  And you see the green pastures [[02:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10596.08s)]
*  And you just look at it and you go [[02:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10598.08s)]
*  My god, this is beautiful [[02:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10600.08s)]
*  It's like a feeling that you have [[02:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10602.08s)]
*  It's not like any other art form [[02:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10604.08s)]
*  It's nature's art form [[02:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10606.08s)]
*  But it has the same kind of feeling [[02:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10608.08s)]
*  When you see like a beautiful piece of art [[02:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10610.08s)]
*  There's this feeling of appreciation [[02:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10612.08s)]
*  That people have for things that are beautiful [[02:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10614.08s)]
*  And I think it's one of the only creatures on earth that probably has that [[02:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10616.08s)]
*  I don't think we're [[02:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10618.08s)]
*  I don't think we have any other animals on this earth [[02:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10620.08s)]
*  That appreciate beauty the way we do [[02:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10622.08s)]
*  Like we [[02:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10624.08s)]
*  It gives us a feeling [[02:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10626.08s)]
*  We stare at it [[02:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10628.08s)]
*  We're entranced by it [[02:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10630.08s)]
*  We're entranced by beauty [[02:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10632.08s)]
*  Physical beauty [[02:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10634.08s)]
*  People that are beautiful [[02:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10636.08s)]

*  We go off of what they tell us [[02:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10706.08s)]
*  And [[02:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10708.08s)]
*  I think that's the scariest fucking part [[02:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10710.08s)]
*  And I look at a star [[02:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10712.08s)]

*  I was surprised by that one [[02:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10772.08s)]
*  I thought something was going to happen [[02:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10774.08s)]
*  I had a license plate in my car [[02:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10776.08s)]

*  Is there DEC 2021 [[02:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10790.08s)]
*  Or DEC 2012 [[02:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10792.08s)]
*  I think it was 2012 [[02:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10794.08s)]
*  What did you think was going to happen? [[02:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10796.08s)]
*  Like what theory did you [[02:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10798.08s)]

*  31 or 2 [[03:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10806.08s)]

*  It's 11 years ago [[03:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10818.08s)]
*  No [[03:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10820.08s)]
*  2012 [[03:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10822.08s)]
*  Oh okay [[03:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10824.08s)]
*  I'm thinking of 2001 [[03:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10826.08s)]
*  2001 was another one [[03:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10828.08s)]
*  Y2K [[03:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10830.08s)]
*  I got confused [[03:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10832.08s)]
*  Let me back up [[03:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10834.08s)]
*  December 21st 2012 [[03:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10836.08s)]
*  Was the one that was the end of the Mayan calendar [[03:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10838.08s)]
*  I think it was [[03:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10840.08s)]
*  DEC 2012 [[03:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10842.08s)]
*  But [[03:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10844.08s)]
*  I was really worried [[03:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10846.08s)]
*  Even more so about the one [[03:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10848.08s)]
*  In 2000, the Y2K one [[03:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10850.08s)]
*  That was a weird one [[03:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10852.08s)]
*  Where people thought that all the clocks were going to stop [[03:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10854.08s)]
*  And all the computers weren't working [[03:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10856.08s)]
*  How do they justify that? [[03:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10858.08s)]
*  They were saying that the programs [[03:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10860.08s)]
*  The computer programs that were running everything [[03:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10862.08s)]
*  They would switch to twos? [[03:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10864.08s)]
*  It's when it goes from 19s to twos [[03:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10866.08s)]
*  The whole thing [[03:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10868.08s)]
*  Apparently they were worried that it was going to have this [[03:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10870.08s)]
*  Ripple effect across the country [[03:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10872.08s)]
*  And the stock market would crash [[03:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10874.08s)]
*  Banks would dissolve, wild shit would happen [[03:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10876.08s)]
*  The fucking power grid would go down [[03:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10878.08s)]
*  It was mostly bullshit [[03:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10880.08s)]
*  But everybody was terrified [[03:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10882.08s)]
*  And me too, I was on the phone with a friend of mine from New York [[03:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10884.08s)]
*  Like dude [[03:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10886.08s)]
*  We're going to ride this out together [[03:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10888.08s)]
*  And then we were drinking [[03:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10890.08s)]
*  I'm getting into archery [[03:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10892.08s)]
*  We were on the phone, he was drinking in New York [[03:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10894.08s)]
*  In California [[03:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10896.08s)]
*  While we were talking on the phone [[03:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10898.08s)]
*  We talked for like three hours [[03:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10900.08s)]
*  And then they said, there ain't shit happening man [[03:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10902.08s)]
*  Everything still works [[03:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10904.08s)]
*  The fucking internet works, computers work, tv works [[03:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10906.08s)]
*  Everything's fine [[03:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10908.08s)]
*  I don't understand the logic [[03:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10910.08s)]
*  I don't get the logic [[03:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10912.08s)]
*  I was 95 [[03:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10914.08s)]
*  So I was like 5 reading about [[03:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10916.08s)]
*  I would see the paper on the counter [[03:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10918.08s)]
*  And it would be like [[03:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10920.08s)]
*  Oh, Y2K, everything's fucking ending [[03:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10922.08s)]
*  And I was like, oh my fucking god [[03:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10924.08s)]
*  Mom, everything's fucking ending [[03:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10926.08s)]
*  But then you look back [[03:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10928.08s)]
*  Why would the year changing over [[03:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10930.08s)]
*  Affect computers? [[03:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10932.08s)]
*  Like why would it change [[03:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10936.08s)]
*  The way they were coded, it's very primitive coding [[03:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10938.08s)]
*  When they first started [[03:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10940.08s)]
*  The computers that run the power grids [[03:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10942.08s)]
*  It's all 0 and 1s though [[03:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10944.08s)]
*  I don't understand it man [[03:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10946.08s)]
*  You're talking to the wrong dude [[03:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10948.08s)]
*  Me fucking too, but from my perspective [[03:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10950.08s)]
*  0 and 1s, why would [[03:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10952.08s)]
*  Just cause you have the app [[03:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10954.08s)]
*  That says, not an app [[03:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10956.08s)]
*  Jamie will explain it to us [[03:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10958.08s)]
*  I don't have an explanation [[03:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10960.08s)]
*  You're on it [[03:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10962.08s)]
*  It's just other countries didn't do it [[03:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10964.08s)]
*  They didn't have any precautions [[03:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10966.08s)]
*  No, they talked about it [[03:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10968.08s)]
*  Everyone talked about it [[03:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10970.08s)]
*  The US spent a bunch of money [[03:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10972.08s)]
*  It's probably a scam [[03:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10974.08s)]
*  It's monkey pox bro [[03:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10976.08s)]
*  It's literally a fucking widget [[03:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10978.08s)]
*  It's a fucking widget [[03:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10980.08s)]
*  On your fucking computer that tells you what year it is [[03:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10982.08s)]
*  The smartest people in the world [[03:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10984.08s)]
*  Can be like [[03:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10986.08s)]
*  We didn't change any of the fucking code [[03:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10988.08s)]
*  On the fucking computer [[03:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10990.08s)]
*  Why would it fuck anything up [[03:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10992.08s)]
*  Just because the widget says [[03:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10994.08s)]
*  That it's 2000 [[03:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10996.08s)]
*  What they were saying [[03:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=10998.08s)]
*  I guess here's the [[03:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11000.08s)]
*  Power plants for instance [[03:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11002.08s)]
*  Have a whole bunch of automated things [[03:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11004.08s)]
*  And those [[03:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11006.08s)]
*  Were in threat [[03:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11008.08s)]
*  For what, just take the date [[03:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11010.08s)]
*  Out of it [[03:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11012.08s)]
*  It's 0s and 1s [[03:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11014.08s)]
*  It still is [[03:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11016.08s)]
*  You're so smart you should work for them [[03:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11018.08s)]
*  I wonder if it was all bullshit [[03:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11020.08s)]
*  They just wanted a reason why they could be [[03:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11022.08s)]
*  It has to be [[03:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11024.08s)]
*  I wouldn't be shocked if it was just something [[03:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11026.08s)]
*  To sell newspapers [[03:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11028.08s)]
*  The media pumped it up and made it a big thing [[03:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11030.08s)]
*  And talked to the biggest fear mongers [[03:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11032.08s)]
*  And got everybody fucking terrified of it [[03:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11034.08s)]
*  It has to be [[03:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11036.08s)]
*  Because then I was so scared [[03:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11038.08s)]
*  But now I'm like why [[03:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11040.08s)]
*  It doesn't even make any sense [[03:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11042.08s)]
*  So December 21st 2012 I thought something was going to happen [[03:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11044.08s)]
*  And maybe something did [[03:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11046.08s)]
*  Maybe in the greater scheme [[03:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11048.08s)]
*  Of time as we look back [[03:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11050.08s)]
*  On the changing of the eras of humanity [[03:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11052.08s)]
*  Maybe that's when we began our cultural slide [[03:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11054.08s)]
*  It might be [[03:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11056.08s)]
*  Joe I think about that a lot [[03:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11058.08s)]
*  It might be a thing where [[03:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11060.08s)]
*  Like ancient civilizations [[03:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11062.08s)]
*  They calculated [[03:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11064.08s)]
*  They sort of charted out [[03:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11066.08s)]
*  The eras of civilizations [[03:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11068.08s)]
*  And that civilizations would go through these periods [[03:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11070.08s)]
*  And then they would have these rebuildings [[03:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11072.08s)]
*  And then they would get soft and fall apart [[03:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11074.08s)]
*  And then there was these things [[03:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11076.08s)]
*  The yugas [[03:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11078.08s)]
*  And that's where we're at now [[03:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11080.08s)]
*  The age of confusion [[03:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11082.08s)]
*  It seems like that makes sense to me [[03:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11084.08s)]
*  It seems like when you have people [[03:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11086.08s)]
*  Like the World War II guys with the fucking guns on acid [[03:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11088.08s)]
*  It's a different breed of human [[03:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11090.08s)]
*  Those trench warfare guys [[03:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11092.08s)]
*  That's a different breed of human being [[03:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11094.08s)]
*  Naughty boys just fucking smoking it [[03:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11096.08s)]
*  Smoking cigarettes in the fucking trenches [[03:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11098.08s)]
*  And like if I see a motherfucker [[03:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11100.08s)]
*  I'm stabbing him [[03:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11102.08s)]
*  It's crazy [[03:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11104.08s)]
*  Crazy [[03:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11106.08s)]
*  Just living your life like that [[03:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11108.08s)]
*  But now war is not even like that [[03:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11110.08s)]
*  Well it is in Ukraine [[03:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11112.08s)]
*  War is so, well now it's fucking drones [[03:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11114.08s)]
*  Yeah but there's a lot of fucking actual gun fights [[03:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11116.08s)]
*  In Ukraine that you can watch on telegram now [[03:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11118.08s)]
*  The crazy thing is the guns they're using [[03:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11120.08s)]
*  Like the guns they're using are like [[03:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11124.08s)]
*  World War II guns [[03:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11128.08s)]
*  And they had like a gun [[03:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11130.08s)]
*  That was electronically operated [[03:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11132.08s)]
*  That they soldered on [[03:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11134.08s)]
*  A trigger and [[03:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11136.08s)]
*  A grip to and a stock on [[03:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11138.08s)]
*  So they could use that gun [[03:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11140.08s)]
*  Like it's just crazy the resources [[03:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11142.08s)]
*  That they're using [[03:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11144.08s)]
*  Right now [[03:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11146.08s)]
*  It's really fucking crazy [[03:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11148.08s)]
*  It's just scary that there's a ground war [[03:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11150.08s)]
*  That's going on right now [[03:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11152.08s)]
*  Between two countries that used to be [[03:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11154.08s)]
*  A part of the same union [[03:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11156.08s)]
*  It's fucking scary man [[03:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11158.08s)]
*  Because I think when people [[03:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11160.08s)]
*  Get through wars [[03:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11162.08s)]
*  When they get through like a civilization [[03:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11164.08s)]
*  Gets through an era, they have this feeling like [[03:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11166.08s)]
*  A lesson was learned [[03:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11168.08s)]
*  I don't think we learn our lessons [[03:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11170.08s)]
*  Especially when there's a lot of money involved [[03:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11172.08s)]
*  In continuing the same kind of behavior [[03:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11174.08s)]
*  And I think that's where we find ourselves right now [[03:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11176.08s)]
*  And that's where the people that are very alarmed [[03:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11178.08s)]
*  By this and they're really scared by this [[03:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11180.08s)]
*  I think they're right [[03:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11182.08s)]
*  This is the time to be very alarmed [[03:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11184.08s)]
*  Because it just seems people are way too casual [[03:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11186.08s)]
*  About wanting this to happen [[03:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11188.08s)]
*  And wanting us to [[03:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11190.08s)]
*  To fund this and beat Russia [[03:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11192.08s)]
*  And all this whole craziness [[03:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11194.08s)]
*  Of war [[03:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11196.08s)]
*  It's so complicated too [[03:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11198.08s)]
*  With the UN and NATO [[03:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11200.08s)]
*  And it's so complicated [[03:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11202.08s)]
*  It's so complicated [[03:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11204.08s)]
*  All of it, it's like there's so much going on [[03:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11206.08s)]
*  That's [[03:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11208.08s)]
*  Well they're trying to play magic the fucking gathering [[03:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11210.08s)]
*  In the fucking world [[03:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11212.08s)]
*  With real fucking people [[03:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11214.08s)]
*  And this doesn't just affect [[03:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11216.08s)]
*  Ukraine or Russia [[03:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11218.08s)]
*  This affects everything [[03:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11220.08s)]
*  If they start [[03:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11222.08s)]
*  Nuking each other, oh my god [[03:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11224.08s)]
*  It's over, Joe, it's over [[03:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11226.08s)]
*  It's over [[03:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11228.08s)]
*  It's over [[03:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11230.08s)]
*  With one nuke it's over [[03:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11232.08s)]
*  One nuke it's over [[03:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11234.08s)]
*  And the nukes that we have today [[03:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11236.08s)]
*  We saw what they did to Hiroshima and Nagasaki [[03:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11238.08s)]
*  Those are a fraction of the power [[03:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11240.08s)]
*  That they have now [[03:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11242.08s)]
*  These things are obliterators [[03:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11244.08s)]
*  Not only a fraction of the power [[03:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11246.08s)]
*  But the amount that we have [[03:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11248.08s)]
*  In this fucking world today [[03:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11250.08s)]

*  I was trying to see which one [[03:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11371.08s)]
*  Probably to bring up this one [[03:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11373.08s)]
*  It shoots a wave out [[03:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11375.08s)]
*  Wow [[03:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11379.08s)]
*  Intercontinental US [[03:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11381.08s)]

*  Powered nuclear armed system [[03:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11385.08s)]
*  Autonomous torpedoes [[03:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11387.08s)]
*  It's very slow but possibly unstoppable [[03:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11389.08s)]
*  I don't like how that's in bold [[03:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11391.08s)]

*  As much as they lie to us [[03:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11395.08s)]
*  I think that's probably 100% unstoppable [[03:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11397.08s)]
*  Russia maintains that it can be used [[03:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11399.08s)]
*  As tactical nuclear weapons against warships [[03:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11401.08s)]

*  Aircraft carriers, this is harder to rationalize [[03:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11405.08s)]
*  Than the second strike [[03:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11407.08s)]
*  Nuclear deterrence role [[03:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11409.08s)]
*  But is a constant theme [[03:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11411.08s)]
*  Ever since it was first revealed in November 2015 [[03:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11413.08s)]
*  Then known as status 6 [[03:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11415.08s)]
*  It's been described as a multi role system [[03:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11417.08s)]
*  That's a scary status 6 [[03:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11419.08s)]
*  What the fuck does that mean [[03:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11421.08s)]
*  There's people out there playing [[03:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11423.08s)]
*  You just said it right [[03:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11425.08s)]
*  There's people out there playing magic the gathering [[03:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11427.08s)]
*  That's what war is [[03:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11429.08s)]
*  And that's the weird thing [[03:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11431.08s)]
*  About war in this age [[03:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11433.08s)]
*  Where people are starting [[03:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11435.08s)]
*  We're more connected now than we've ever been before [[03:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11437.08s)]

*  That we're being led by these leaders [[03:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11441.08s)]
*  That have us [[03:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11443.08s)]
*  Fighting over territorial swaths of land [[03:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11445.08s)]
*  Control of resources [[03:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11447.08s)]
*  Or just like my religion is right [[03:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11449.08s)]
*  Yours is not [[03:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11451.08s)]
*  I'm right, you're wrong [[03:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11453.08s)]
*  We're going to fuck everything up or try to [[03:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11455.08s)]
*  The world becomes more globally oriented [[03:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11457.08s)]
*  And realizing that [[03:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11459.08s)]
*  There's just people [[03:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11461.08s)]
*  There's people in India, there's just people in China [[03:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11463.08s)]
*  There's people in Russia, the problem is who they're led by [[03:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11465.08s)]
*  And when they lead you [[03:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11467.08s)]
*  Into this position and control [[03:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11469.08s)]
*  The population to a position where they can't [[03:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11471.08s)]
*  Do anything other than the will [[03:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11473.08s)]
*  Of the leaders [[03:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11475.08s)]
*  That's where [[03:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11477.08s)]
*  That seems like [[03:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11479.08s)]
*  The only positive [[03:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11481.08s)]
*  Direction that I see moving forward [[03:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11483.08s)]
*  Is that people think about the world [[03:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11485.08s)]
*  As one place now more [[03:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11487.08s)]
*  Instead of thinking [[03:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11489.08s)]
*  I don't think people are as nationally centric as they used to be [[03:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11491.08s)]
*  We're paying attention to shit that's going on in Australia [[03:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11493.08s)]
*  We're paying attention to shit that's going on in Hong Kong [[03:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11495.08s)]

*  In the 1950s or the 1960s [[03:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11503.08s)]
*  I think with the internet, I think people are very [[03:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11505.08s)]
*  Tuned in to all kinds of weird shit [[03:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11507.08s)]
*  That's happening everywhere [[03:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11509.08s)]
*  And that's an interesting thing [[03:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11511.08s)]
*  Because I don't know [[03:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11513.08s)]
*  Would you ever consider [[03:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11515.08s)]

*  You can't make honking your horns illegal [[03:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11537.08s)]
*  Bro, they froze people's bank accounts [[03:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11539.08s)]

*  Which is crazy [[03:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11563.08s)]
*  And you can track all that shit [[03:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11565.08s)]

*  And they sent you back [[03:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11595.08s)]
*  Never thought about it [[03:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11597.08s)]
*  So how do you feel about [[03:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11599.08s)]
*  The government's [[03:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11601.08s)]
*  Digital currency [[03:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11603.08s)]
*  No fucking way [[03:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11605.08s)]
*  No way, that's what I think [[03:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11607.08s)]
*  I think that's checkmate, that's game over [[03:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11609.08s)]
*  Because if they apply that to a social credit score [[03:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11611.08s)]
*  If they decide [[03:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11613.08s)]
*  Somehow or another that you need some [[03:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11615.08s)]
*  Social credit score system [[03:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11617.08s)]
*  For the benefit of society [[03:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11619.08s)]
*  And they outline that they can track your behavior [[03:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11621.08s)]
*  And your tweets and all your things [[03:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11623.08s)]
*  And if you get a score [[03:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11625.08s)]
*  They're already doing that [[03:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11627.08s)]
*  They just haven't released the fucking report cards [[03:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11629.08s)]
*  They haven't sent the report [[03:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11631.08s)]
*  They didn't send the report cards home [[03:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11633.08s)]
*  To the parents yet [[03:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11635.08s)]
*  Everything is already [[03:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11637.08s)]
*  Imprinted, everything is already tracked [[03:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11639.08s)]
*  Everything is already there [[03:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11641.08s)]
*  We just haven't given a denomination [[03:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11643.08s)]
*  They just can't control you to the same extent [[03:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11645.08s)]
*  That they would like [[03:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11647.08s)]
*  And what they would like to do is to be able to strip you of your money [[03:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11649.08s)]
*  And to be able to lock you down [[03:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11651.08s)]
*  And to ensure that you comply [[03:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11653.08s)]
*  So that all the other people also comply [[03:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11655.08s)]
*  Because they don't want to be stripped of their money [[03:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11657.08s)]
*  They don't want everything they work for to just be taking away [[03:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11659.08s)]
*  Instantly overnight and be powerless [[03:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11661.08s)]
*  No one to call, no one is going to answer your phone [[03:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11663.08s)]
*  They just decided [[03:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11665.08s)]
*  You fucked up and the rules are the rules [[03:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11667.08s)]
*  And so then where does that money go? [[03:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11669.08s)]
*  Who takes your money? [[03:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11671.08s)]
*  And that's what I think, when people start profiting [[03:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11673.08s)]
*  Off of confiscating people's [[03:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11675.08s)]
*  Digital currency [[03:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11677.08s)]
*  It's going to be a real fucking problem [[03:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11679.08s)]
*  Well people, it's not [[03:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11681.08s)]
*  All fucking currency is digital [[03:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11683.08s)]
*  Yeah, but the idea of them [[03:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11685.08s)]
*  Controlling all of the money [[03:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11687.08s)]
*  And it's all unilateral [[03:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11689.08s)]
*  It's all the same fucking thing [[03:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11691.08s)]
*  That's a problem [[03:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11693.08s)]
*  And here's the problem [[03:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11695.08s)]
*  I think, is that people are going to do it [[03:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11697.08s)]
*  Due to convenience of it [[03:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11699.08s)]
*  Yeah [[03:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11701.08s)]
*  No one wants to carry around cash anymore [[03:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11703.08s)]
*  That's already, cash is gone [[03:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11705.08s)]
*  No one wants to carry around cash anymore [[03:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11707.08s)]
*  I saw a video of a lady paying for her groceries [[03:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11709.08s)]
*  With her fingerprint at Whole Foods [[03:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11711.08s)]
*  Can I see this? [[03:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11713.08s)]
*  Yeah, she used her hand print [[03:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11715.08s)]
*  You can do it here [[03:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11717.08s)]
*  You got it? [[03:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11719.08s)]
*  Wait, Amazon controls it [[03:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11721.08s)]
*  With your hand? [[03:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11723.08s)]
*  I didn't do it [[03:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11725.08s)]
*  You just walk up, your hand hovers over this thing [[03:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11727.08s)]
*  It takes a photo of your hand and you pay [[03:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11729.08s)]
*  Why? [[03:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11733.08s)]
*  Why? [[03:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11735.08s)]
*  People want their hand print in a database [[03:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11737.08s)]
*  Just in case they murder somebody [[03:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11739.08s)]
*  This is crazy [[03:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11741.08s)]
*  This is crazy [[03:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11743.08s)]
*  One scan does it all [[03:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11745.08s)]
*  Amazon one simplifies everyday interactions [[03:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11747.08s)]

*  You can use your pub hairs [[03:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11765.08s)]
*  There's a store in Ohio where you just [[03:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11767.08s)]
*  I don't think you leave with stuff but you just tell them what you want [[03:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11769.08s)]
*  And then they just send it to you [[03:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11771.08s)]
*  Amazon store [[03:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11773.08s)]

*  Where it's like you go and you pick up [[03:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11781.08s)]
*  What you get and then [[03:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11783.08s)]
*  You leave the money [[03:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11785.08s)]
*  You swipe your card, all this shit [[03:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11787.08s)]
*  There's no employees in the whole store [[03:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11789.08s)]
*  That's crazy [[03:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11791.08s)]
*  You just pick up your chips, you pick up your drink [[03:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11793.08s)]
*  You pick up whatever you can [[03:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11795.08s)]
*  Your sandwich? Yep [[03:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11797.08s)]

*  I don't know [[03:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11801.08s)]
*  I don't know how these are working [[03:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11803.08s)]
*  Probably better to pay someone 15 bucks an hour [[03:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11805.08s)]
*  Just one guy [[03:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11807.08s)]
*  But now I guess you can't [[03:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11809.08s)]
*  And I understand it completely [[03:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11811.08s)]
*  Because what if the employee gets hurt [[03:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11813.08s)]
*  Or what if someone [[03:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11815.08s)]
*  gets hurt in a situation [[03:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11817.08s)]
*  But like shoplifting is huge [[03:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11819.08s)]
*  Because now all these companies have [[03:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11821.08s)]
*  policies to where it's like [[03:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11823.08s)]
*  If anything happens [[03:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11825.08s)]
*  You don't even say anything to the guys [[03:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11827.08s)]
*  You're not even allowed to stop them [[03:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11829.08s)]
*  People get fired [[03:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11831.08s)]
*  For trying to stop them [[03:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11833.08s)]
*  Don't even say like hey dude don't fucking steal [[03:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11835.08s)]
*  I see what's in your fucking shirt [[03:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11837.08s)]
*  Don't even do that [[03:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11839.08s)]
*  Wasn't there a story recently where a woman got beat up [[03:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11841.08s)]
*  And then they fired her because she was trying [[03:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11843.08s)]
*  To stop the shoplifters? [[03:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11845.08s)]
*  I mean [[03:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11847.08s)]
*  It's all a liability thing [[03:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11849.08s)]
*  It's a liability issue [[03:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11851.08s)]
*  To where it's like that [[03:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11853.08s)]
*  The company doesn't want to be liable [[03:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11855.08s)]
*  She got her job back [[03:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11859.08s)]
*  Has her job back after she was fired [[03:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11861.08s)]
*  Public outrage works [[03:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11863.08s)]
*  After she was fired last month for attempting [[03:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11865.08s)]
*  To stop shoplifters at a Lowe's store in Georgia [[03:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11867.08s)]
*  June 25th [[03:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11869.08s)]
*  Three suspects load over $2,000 worth [[03:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11871.08s)]
*  Of merchandise into a shopping cart [[03:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11873.08s)]
*  Left Lowe's store without paying police said [[03:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11875.08s)]
*  And I think she tried to stop them [[03:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11877.08s)]
*  I think they beat her up too [[03:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11879.08s)]
*  Which is even sadder than they [[03:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11881.08s)]
*  68 year old lady [[03:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11883.08s)]
*  These guys are such pieces of shit [[03:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11885.08s)]
*  They beat up an old lady and then that lady got fired [[03:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11887.08s)]
*  That's crazy [[03:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11889.08s)]
*  I'm happy she got her job back [[03:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11891.08s)]
*  She probably doesn't want it [[03:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11893.08s)]
*  I don't want to work at Lowe's anymore [[03:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11895.08s)]
*  I want to work at corporate god damn it [[03:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11897.08s)]
*  It would probably be better if they sued her [[03:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11899.08s)]
*  Or if she sued them [[03:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11901.08s)]
*  She would have got a nice fat payday [[03:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11903.08s)]
*  I'm getting crazy too [[03:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11905.08s)]
*  But in that situation I'm kind of on her side [[03:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11907.08s)]
*  Look [[03:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11909.08s)]
*  I know it's not even your shit [[03:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11911.08s)]
*  I know it's not your shit [[03:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11913.08s)]
*  But you have [[03:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11915.08s)]
*  I don't know if you [[03:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11917.08s)]
*  Enjoy your job or your [[03:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11919.08s)]
*  Or what you do [[03:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11921.08s)]
*  Just a little bit [[03:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11923.08s)]
*  If you have friends at the store [[03:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11925.08s)]
*  If you have anything it's like [[03:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11927.08s)]
*  You don't got to take that shit [[03:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11929.08s)]
*  Like don't take that shit [[03:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11931.08s)]
*  I know it's [[03:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11933.08s)]
*  The big head shit [[03:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11935.08s)]
*  But it's like [[03:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11937.08s)]
*  You have an inclination to kind of like [[03:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11939.08s)]
*  Protect it [[03:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11941.08s)]
*  You do this every day [[03:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11943.08s)]
*  It's every day [[03:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11945.08s)]
*  There used to be someone who would always stop someone from shoplifting [[03:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11947.08s)]
*  There was always a security guard at a store [[03:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11949.08s)]
*  To keep people from shoplifting [[03:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11951.08s)]
*  It was normal [[03:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11953.08s)]
*  Now people just run in large groups [[03:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11955.08s)]
*  And they just snatch everything [[03:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11957.08s)]
*  And smash glass and steal all those fucking watches [[03:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11959.08s)]
*  Everyone just has to stand there [[03:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11961.08s)]
*  You can't do that [[03:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11963.08s)]
*  Because it literally encourages [[03:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11965.08s)]
*  Crime because there's very little repercussions [[03:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11967.08s)]
*  It's crazy [[03:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11969.08s)]
*  That people are going with that [[03:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11971.08s)]
*  It's just [[03:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11973.08s)]
*  You know if you wanted to be a full on conspiracy theorist [[03:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11975.08s)]
*  You would say this is someone trying to destabilize [[03:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11977.08s)]
*  Society and that's the way to do it [[03:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11979.08s)]
*  The way to destabilize society is make things [[03:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11981.08s)]
*  As lawless as possible [[03:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11983.08s)]
*  And then people will do whatever [[03:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11985.08s)]
*  They need to do [[03:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11987.08s)]
*  In order to bring back some semblance of normalcy [[03:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11989.08s)]
*  What do I have to do? [[03:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11991.08s)]
*  What rights do I have to give up? [[03:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11993.08s)]
*  What do I have to give up? I'll do it [[03:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11995.08s)]
*  Well you gotta submit to the one world currency [[03:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11997.08s)]
*  And then [[03:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=11999.08s)]
*  For real [[03:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12001.08s)]
*  Look if you wanted to look at a [[03:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12003.08s)]
*  Long term engineering product [[03:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12005.08s)]
*  Project rather [[03:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12007.08s)]
*  You could [[03:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12009.08s)]
*  If you had enough resources and you were clever enough [[03:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12011.08s)]
*  And you planned this out enough [[03:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12013.08s)]
*  You could engineer the downfall of a society [[03:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12015.08s)]
*  And you would do it by [[03:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12017.08s)]
*  Infecting the [[03:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12019.08s)]
*  Universities [[03:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12021.08s)]
*  And [[03:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12023.08s)]
*  Entrenching them in a ridiculous [[03:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12025.08s)]
*  Unsupportable ideology and then have people [[03:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12027.08s)]
*  Go out in the world with that ideology [[03:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12029.08s)]
*  And think this is a rational way [[03:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12031.08s)]
*  To live life [[03:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12033.08s)]
*  And to run the world and then while [[03:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12035.08s)]
*  You're doing that you're also [[03:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12037.08s)]
*  Setting it up so that you have [[03:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12039.08s)]
*  Less [[03:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12041.08s)]
*  Less people get arrested for things [[03:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12043.08s)]
*  More people get released from prison for things [[03:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12045.08s)]
*  There would be a bunch of different [[03:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12047.08s)]
*  Ways that you could destabilize [[03:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12049.08s)]
*  Society but one of the best ones [[03:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12051.08s)]
*  Would be to encourage crime [[03:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12053.08s)]
*  If you wanted to somehow or another [[03:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12055.08s)]
*  You could do it under the guise of making [[03:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12057.08s)]
*  It more fair for all these people that get arrested [[03:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12059.08s)]
*  Making it more fair [[03:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12061.08s)]
*  For you know nobody wants to be racist [[03:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12063.08s)]
*  You just say it's racial [[03:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12065.08s)]
*  Injustice and just let more [[03:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12067.08s)]
*  Violent criminals out onto the street [[03:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12069.08s)]
*  If you wanted to destabilize society [[03:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12071.08s)]
*  I was not saying that prison reform isn't [[03:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12073.08s)]
*  Hugely necessary it is [[03:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12075.08s)]
*  For sure they need to do a way [[03:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12077.08s)]
*  Better job of trying to rehabilitate people as well [[03:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12079.08s)]
*  Instead of just incarcerating them [[03:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12081.08s)]
*  But letting [[03:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12083.08s)]
*  People out that are violent criminals [[03:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12085.08s)]
*  Seems like what I would do [[03:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12087.08s)]
*  If I was trying to destabilize society [[03:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12089.08s)]
*  I think an easier way [[03:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12091.08s)]
*  Here's what I would do. What would you do if you [[03:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12093.08s)]
*  Were an evil dictator [[03:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12095.08s)]
*  I would just say [[03:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12097.08s)]
*  I would just shut everybody's shit down and say [[03:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12099.08s)]
*  I was an attack from another country [[03:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12101.08s)]
*  If New York [[03:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12103.08s)]
*  Or LA [[03:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12105.08s)]
*  Collapses the rest of the world [[03:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12107.08s)]
*  Follows suit [[03:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12109.08s)]
*  So [[03:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12111.08s)]
*  Talk about a lot [[03:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12113.08s)]
*  Only like fucking 3% of your money is actually real [[03:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12115.08s)]
*  The rest is fucking [[03:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12117.08s)]
*  A digital number and we saw it with the [[03:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12119.08s)]
*  Banks collapsing all these [[03:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12121.08s)]
*  Smaller banks [[03:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12123.08s)]
*  But they get [[03:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12125.08s)]
*  But the payout is 250 grand [[03:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12127.08s)]
*  You're insured your money is insured [[03:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12129.08s)]
*  For you could have a billion [[03:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12131.08s)]
*  Dollars in this bank [[03:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12133.08s)]
*  You're paid out [[03:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12135.08s)]
*  250 grand [[03:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12137.08s)]
*  And then where'd the rest of that money go [[03:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12139.08s)]
*  Where the fuck did it go [[03:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12141.08s)]
*  All you need to say is if someone goes in [[03:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12143.08s)]
*  Or someone tries to order [[03:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12145.08s)]
*  Postmates on their phone [[03:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12147.08s)]

*  All it takes is [[03:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12167.08s)]
*  Because everything is so digital now [[03:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12169.08s)]
*  It takes just like you mentioned in Canada [[03:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12173.08s)]
*  Where they're like okay people who donated [[03:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12175.08s)]
*  To these guys are getting [[03:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12177.08s)]
*  Their bank accounts shut off [[03:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12179.08s)]
*  Imagine that happened to an entire [[03:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12181.08s)]
*  Major city [[03:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12183.08s)]
*  Well have you ever looked into how vulnerable [[03:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12185.08s)]
*  It would be anarchy everywhere [[03:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12187.08s)]
*  Have you ever looked into how vulnerable the power grid is [[03:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12189.08s)]
*  I know [[03:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12191.08s)]
*  How vulnerable it is [[03:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12193.08s)]
*  Because in Utah [[03:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12195.08s)]
*  Not even the power grid but [[03:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12197.08s)]
*  For internet [[03:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12199.08s)]
*  So a disgruntled [[03:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12201.08s)]
*  Employee took an axe to a box [[03:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12203.08s)]
*  And shut down the whole fucking [[03:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12207.08s)]
*  Places fucking like my whole [[03:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12209.08s)]
*  Entire side I live in Cottonwood Heights [[03:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12211.08s)]
*  In Utah [[03:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12213.08s)]
*  And [[03:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12215.08s)]
*  The whole shit went out [[03:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12217.08s)]
*  Because some guy was just mad [[03:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12219.08s)]
*  And he just took a fucking [[03:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12221.08s)]
*  Axe to a box [[03:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12223.08s)]
*  That's crazy [[03:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12225.08s)]
*  And shut everybody's internet off [[03:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12227.08s)]
*  And it sucks [[03:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12229.08s)]
*  I like having internet [[03:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12231.08s)]
*  I gotta watch the fucking Joe Rogan experience [[03:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12233.08s)]
*  Wow [[03:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12237.08s)]
*  It's that vulnerable [[03:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12239.08s)]
*  I knew how to do it and not get electrocuted [[03:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12241.08s)]
*  If you had a box [[03:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12243.08s)]
*  And it's filled with wires [[03:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12245.08s)]
*  And you got an axe wouldn't you assume you're gonna die [[03:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12247.08s)]
*  I don't know how it goes [[03:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12249.08s)]
*  I don't know how it goes either [[03:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12251.08s)]
*  All I know is I didn't have [[03:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12253.08s)]
*  Fucking wifi for fucking [[03:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12255.08s)]
*  Four days [[03:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12257.08s)]
*  Do you think wifi is bad for you [[03:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12261.08s)]
*  I wonder about that [[03:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12263.08s)]
*  That's a good question I remember [[03:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12265.08s)]
*  Oh covid's caused by wifi all this shit [[03:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12267.08s)]
*  5G [[03:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12269.08s)]
*  5G yeah [[03:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12271.08s)]
*  But I don't know what is interesting [[03:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12273.08s)]
*  Is seeing those little boxes pop up [[03:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12275.08s)]
*  Around everywhere disguised as [[03:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12277.08s)]
*  Palm trees in California [[03:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12279.08s)]
*  And just kind of scattered around in New York [[03:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12281.08s)]
*  The cell phone towers [[03:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12283.08s)]
*  I don't know are they cell phone towers [[03:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12285.08s)]
*  Yeah they look like fake trees [[03:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12287.08s)]
*  They have like these little [[03:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12289.08s)]
*  Square things on them or these rectangular things on them [[03:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12291.08s)]
*  It's but [[03:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12293.08s)]
*  Smaller like deployable [[03:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12295.08s)]
*  Variants of it I guess [[03:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12297.08s)]
*  Cause how big is the cell phone tower [[03:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12299.08s)]
*  It's big [[03:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12301.08s)]
*  I think they probably vary in size too though [[03:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12303.08s)]
*  There's probably like a lot of other things [[03:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12305.08s)]
*  If it's dealing with a lot of [[03:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12307.08s)]
*  You know what's really crazy about cell phones [[03:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12309.08s)]
*  If you're in a place where too many people are using them [[03:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12311.08s)]
*  Yours doesn't work [[03:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12313.08s)]
*  At the concerts they don't work [[03:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12315.08s)]
*  That's wild [[03:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12317.08s)]
*  Why is it? Because there's not enough juice for everybody [[03:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12319.08s)]
*  They're overselling [[03:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12321.08s)]
*  Yeah [[03:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12323.08s)]
*  Are we running out of bandwidth? [[03:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12325.08s)]
*  Well there is, if you have a concert [[03:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12327.08s)]
*  And you know you have 20,000 people [[03:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12329.08s)]
*  In an arena and you try to get on your phone [[03:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12331.08s)]
*  Like I experience it at the UFC [[03:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12333.08s)]
*  All the time, I can't get text messages [[03:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12335.08s)]
*  That just don't come through [[03:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12337.08s)]
*  Sometimes, it depends on the place [[03:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12339.08s)]
*  Even if you're on the venue [[03:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12341.08s)]
*  Wifi or whatever [[03:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12343.08s)]
*  You'd have to get on the venue Wifi then you'd probably be okay [[03:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12345.08s)]
*  But when you're just trying to use straight cellular [[03:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12347.08s)]
*  A lot of times those places are just too many people on the line [[03:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12349.08s)]
*  But still I notice how it works [[03:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12351.08s)]
*  Before everybody comes to the shows [[03:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12353.08s)]
*  And I'm taking a shit [[03:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12355.08s)]
*  And it works fine [[03:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12357.08s)]
*  And then when everybody comes and I'm still on the Wifi [[03:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12359.08s)]
*  And I got to shit before the show [[03:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12361.08s)]
*  Because I don't want to shit my pants on stage [[03:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12363.08s)]
*  It doesn't work as well [[03:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12365.08s)]
*  Yeah [[03:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12367.08s)]
*  Joe I got a 10-1 real quick [[03:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12369.08s)]
*  Do you want to wrap this up? [[03:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12371.08s)]
*  We've been going for like 3 hours [[03:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12373.08s)]
*  I'm good to go whenever you want [[03:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12375.08s)]
*  Shall we wrap it up? Sure [[03:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12377.08s)]
*  3 and a half hours [[03:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12379.08s)]
*  I'll let you get the fuck out of here [[03:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12381.08s)]
*  I'm having a great time [[03:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12383.08s)]
*  Let's keep going [[03:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12385.08s)]

*  In the world [[03:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12399.08s)]
*  This is one of the best ones [[03:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12401.08s)]
*  Just to be able to hang out with people [[03:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12403.08s)]
*  I don't think a lot of people do this anymore [[03:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12405.08s)]

*  But I've been on Travis Barker's tour bus [[03:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12479.08s)]
*  For a long time [[03:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12481.08s)]

*  And she let me use her tour bus this time [[03:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12487.08s)]
*  And she let me use her tour bus this time [[03:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12489.08s)]
*  And the difference between a dude's tour bus [[03:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12491.08s)]
*  And a lady's tour bus [[03:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12493.08s)]
*  Is like fucking night and day [[03:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12495.08s)]

*  I remember the first time I got on the tour bus [[03:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12501.08s)]
*  Travis's tour bus [[03:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12503.08s)]
*  And I go and lay back [[03:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12505.08s)]
*  And I go and lay back [[03:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12507.08s)]
*  It was after the first show [[03:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12509.08s)]
*  Because I went and checked it out before [[03:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12511.08s)]
*  And I was like oh this is really nice [[03:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12513.08s)]
*  And then I go back the first day [[03:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12515.08s)]
*  And then I go back the first day [[03:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12517.08s)]
*  Or after the first show [[03:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12519.08s)]
*  And go lay down [[03:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12521.08s)]
*  And then I close the door [[03:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12523.08s)]
*  It's all like on the hydraulic doors [[03:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12525.08s)]
*  And so it closes and there's a mirror on the door [[03:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12527.08s)]
*  And there's a picture here [[03:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12529.08s)]
*  And it looks like a guy [[03:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12531.08s)]
*  Like laying down [[03:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12533.08s)]
*  Like a mermaid [[03:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12535.08s)]
*  Like a mermaid pose kind of like [[03:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12537.08s)]
*  Kind of like this looking back on the bed [[03:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12539.08s)]
*  Kind of like this looking back on the bed [[03:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12541.08s)]
*  And I get up [[03:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12543.08s)]
*  And I'm like what the fuck is that [[03:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12545.08s)]
*  And [[03:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12547.08s)]
*  And I get up [[03:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12553.08s)]
*  And I get up and I look closer [[03:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12555.08s)]
*  And it's Tommy Lee [[03:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12557.08s)]

*  Fucking crazy [[03:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12565.08s)]
*  So that's how it kicked off a couple of my tours [[03:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12567.08s)]
*  But not on this bus [[03:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12569.08s)]
*  Like the fridge is like pink [[03:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12571.08s)]
*  And like works and everything [[03:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12573.08s)]
*  And the thing is your bus is absolutely beautiful [[03:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12575.08s)]
*  But yeah it's nice [[03:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12577.08s)]
*  And for whenever the baby [[03:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12579.08s)]
*  And the lady are on the bus [[03:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12581.08s)]
*  There's like a nice vanity mirror [[03:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12583.08s)]
*  Out back for them [[03:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12585.08s)]
*  My only fear of buses [[03:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12587.08s)]
*  Is that you're on the highway [[03:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12589.08s)]
*  And I see too many fucking accident videos [[03:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12591.08s)]
*  It's fucking scary [[03:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12593.08s)]
*  It's easy to flip those fuckers [[03:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12595.08s)]
*  I watched this crazy video the other day [[03:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12597.08s)]
*  Of this car [[03:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12601.08s)]
*  Rear ends this car [[03:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12603.08s)]
*  And they stop in traffic [[03:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12605.08s)]
*  And then this semi rear ends them [[03:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12607.08s)]
*  It can't stop and it's trying to change lanes [[03:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12611.08s)]
*  Because these guys bumped into each other on the highway [[03:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12613.08s)]
*  They decided to stop [[03:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12615.08s)]
*  And then this semi comes through [[03:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12617.08s)]
*  And obliterates them [[03:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12619.08s)]
*  I'm like jeeeeeeeesus [[03:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12621.08s)]
*  It's so heavy [[03:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12623.08s)]
*  It's so much weight and force [[03:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12625.08s)]
*  It's so big [[03:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12627.08s)]
*  When you watch the semi hit the cars [[03:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12629.08s)]
*  The cars just disintegrate [[03:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12631.08s)]
*  It's a big vehicle [[03:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12633.08s)]
*  It's so massive [[03:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12635.08s)]
*  And then it goes flipping off [[03:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12637.08s)]
*  This fucking side of the guard rail [[03:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12639.08s)]
*  And it's just jeeeeeesus [[03:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12641.08s)]
*  So that's the thing with me about the tour bus thing [[03:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12643.08s)]
*  So you never take a tour bus? [[03:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12645.08s)]
*  No [[03:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12647.08s)]
*  Do you go on tour? [[03:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12649.08s)]
*  I do weekends and I come back home [[03:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12651.08s)]
*  And I do like two weekends in a month [[03:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12653.08s)]

*  I do it in town and now I do it at my own club [[03:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=12663.08s)]

*  It's the original Gangsta rap [[03:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13387.08s)]
*  It's the whole [[03:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13389.08s)]
*  It's an old school production [[03:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13391.08s)]
*  It's an old school voice [[03:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13393.08s)]
*  And I find like [[03:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13395.08s)]
*  A lot of the time in country now [[03:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13397.08s)]
*  It's very over produced [[03:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13399.08s)]
*  And so what I love about [[03:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13401.08s)]
*  Like Kulture and Tyler and everything [[03:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13403.08s)]
*  Is it's just like kind of more traditional [[03:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13405.08s)]
*  In that way where it's just like [[03:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13407.08s)]
*  That same bounce [[03:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13409.08s)]
*  You want that boom [[03:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13411.08s)]
*  I don't know [[03:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13413.08s)]
*  There's a thing where people are trying to make hits [[03:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13415.08s)]
*  Right [[03:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13417.08s)]
*  Instead of just trying to make something beautiful [[03:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13419.08s)]
*  It works [[03:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13421.08s)]
*  Yeah it's like that [[03:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13423.08s)]
*  I guess there's like so much money in making hits [[03:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13425.08s)]
*  That there's going to be people that are technicians [[03:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13427.08s)]
*  Turns out [[03:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13429.08s)]
*  Look at you buying a two million dollar magic [[03:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13431.08s)]
*  The gathering cards [[03:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13433.08s)]
*  Actually the fun part that wasn't my bank account [[03:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13435.08s)]
*  That was actually my buddies [[03:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13437.08s)]
*  But a big part of your appeal [[03:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13439.08s)]
*  Is your authenticity [[03:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13441.08s)]
*  And your ability to be part of why people love you [[03:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13443.08s)]
*  And I think that [[03:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13445.08s)]
*  What you're saying is that there's a lot of [[03:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13447.08s)]
*  Over production of things [[03:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13449.08s)]
*  It kind of takes away some of it [[03:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13451.08s)]
*  Well sure and I've [[03:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13453.08s)]
*  I've made [[03:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13455.08s)]

*  It was like one session I think [[03:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13771.08s)]
*  I don't think he had more than one album [[03:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13773.08s)]
*  That you can get right [[03:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13775.08s)]
*  But what year was that [[03:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13777.08s)]
*  1936 [[03:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13779.08s)]
*  That's crazy [[03:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13781.08s)]
*  And that guy was so good they thought he sold his soul to the devil [[03:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13783.08s)]
*  I don't know [[03:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13785.08s)]
*  They're like there's no way you can be that good [[03:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13787.08s)]
*  There's no way [[03:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13789.08s)]
*  1936 and 1937 [[03:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13791.08s)]
*  Wow [[03:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13793.08s)]
*  Most were first released on 78 RPM records in 1937 [[03:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13795.08s)]
*  That's crazy [[03:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13797.08s)]
*  Wow [[03:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13799.08s)]
*  So how did he become [[03:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13801.08s)]
*  Such a legend you gotta wonder [[03:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13803.08s)]
*  Did he just go around and everybody knew him [[03:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13805.08s)]
*  That's a good question [[03:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13807.08s)]
*  That's a good question [[03:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13809.08s)]
*  I guess he was just like the Dave Chappelle [[03:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13811.08s)]
*  Of blues singers back then [[03:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13813.08s)]
*  Sure [[03:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13815.08s)]
*  He was just this guy that was above everybody [[03:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13817.08s)]
*  And everybody was like Jesus Christ [[03:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13819.08s)]
*  How are you doing this [[03:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13821.08s)]
*  He would play like just [[03:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13823.08s)]
*  I love that Delta fucking sound [[03:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13825.08s)]
*  It's so scrappy [[03:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13827.08s)]
*  Give me some Robert Johnson [[03:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13829.08s)]
*  But it's also you gotta imagine the time [[03:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13831.08s)]
*  People are just [[03:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13833.08s)]
*  In the Great Depression [[03:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13835.08s)]
*  People are starving [[03:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13837.08s)]
*  They're fucked [[03:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13839.08s)]
*  The world's fucked [[03:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13841.08s)]
*  It's post World War I, pre World War II [[03:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13843.08s)]
*  Horrible [[03:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13845.08s)]
*  Time [[03:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13847.08s)]
*  Just squalor [[03:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13849.08s)]
*  And famine [[03:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13851.08s)]
*  Hard to get real good food [[03:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13853.08s)]
*  It's not like there's a Whole Foods in your fucking neighborhood [[03:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13855.08s)]
*  Things were weird back then [[03:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13857.08s)]
*  And this guy [[03:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13859.08s)]
*  Is in the deep south [[03:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13861.08s)]
*  This is recalling [[03:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13865.08s)]
*  What's crazy is like all music [[03:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13895.08s)]
*  Recorded music [[03:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13897.08s)]
*  Has its roots in something from before [[03:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13899.08s)]
*  All of it [[03:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13901.08s)]
*  You know this [[03:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13903.08s)]
*  This emerged [[03:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13905.08s)]
*  His creation [[03:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13907.08s)]
*  You know when this got sold [[03:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13909.08s)]
*  And entered into the [[03:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13911.08s)]
*  Just the zeitgeist [[03:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13913.08s)]
*  Of human beings [[03:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13915.08s)]
*  And he was like [[03:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13917.08s)]
*  I'm gonna go to the [[03:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13919.08s)]
*  I'm gonna go to the [[03:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13921.08s)]
*  The zeitgeist of human consciousness [[03:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13923.08s)]
*  Now they're aware that there's a guy [[03:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13925.08s)]
*  Out there that can do this [[03:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13927.08s)]
*  Because before there wasn't anybody [[03:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13929.08s)]
*  Like this guy right [[03:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13931.08s)]
*  And all of a sudden he comes along [[03:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13933.08s)]
*  And hits this level that nobody had ever hit before [[03:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13935.08s)]
*  Yeah you gotta [[03:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13937.08s)]
*  That's crazy because like [[03:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13939.08s)]
*  All these ideas like [[03:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13941.08s)]
*  Who invented a pinch [[03:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13943.08s)]
*  Harmonic [[03:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13945.08s)]
*  Like the whaaaaat [[03:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13947.08s)]
*  Like on the guitar like who's like you know what [[03:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13949.08s)]
*  I'm gonna hold my pick just right and hit that fucking string [[03:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13951.08s)]
*  It's gonna sound [[03:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13953.08s)]
*  This different and I'm gonna make that my signature sound [[03:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13955.08s)]
*  And then you're just gonna blow up [[03:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13957.08s)]
*  But that's just something that you do [[03:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13959.08s)]
*  Like his vibrato on his voice [[03:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13961.08s)]
*  And shit like [[03:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13963.08s)]
*  I think [[03:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13965.08s)]
*  That's something [[03:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13967.08s)]
*  Whenever I first started [[03:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13969.08s)]
*  Making music that was something that [[03:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13971.08s)]
*  Really [[03:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13973.08s)]
*  Like [[03:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13975.08s)]
*  If not [[03:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13977.08s)]
*  Propelled me [[03:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13979.08s)]
*  Was something that was a little [[03:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13981.08s)]
*  Different cause I had a little [[03:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13983.08s)]
*  I always tried to copy like Stevie [[03:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13985.08s)]
*  Nicks and there's a guy named Conor O. Burr [[03:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13987.08s)]
*  From Bright Eyes and he would have this great [[03:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13989.08s)]
*  Like [[03:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13991.08s)]
*  Vibrato in his voice when he sang [[03:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13993.08s)]
*  And Stevie would too [[03:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13995.08s)]
*  And I think that that wasn't being [[03:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13997.08s)]
*  Done and that's just the way I naturally [[03:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=13999.08s)]
*  Sang as a kid [[03:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14001.08s)]
*  And it sounded like shit [[03:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14003.08s)]
*  But as I got older that's just the way [[03:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14005.08s)]
*  I sang [[03:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14007.08s)]
*  So I think that kind of was a thing [[03:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14009.08s)]
*  That [[03:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14011.08s)]
*  I wouldn't say propelled me but made me [[03:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14013.08s)]
*  A little [[03:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14015.08s)]
*  A little different you know what I mean? [[03:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14017.08s)]
*  Because everybody has their own unique style [[03:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14019.08s)]
*  And there's something to listen to for everybody [[03:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14021.08s)]
*  You know? And [[03:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14023.08s)]
*  I think that was something that [[03:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14025.08s)]
*  Really like [[03:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14027.08s)]
*  Okay this is [[03:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14029.08s)]
*  He has a unique voice if that makes [[03:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14031.08s)]
*  Sense you know? [[03:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14033.08s)]
*  Yes. It's like [[03:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14035.08s)]
*  Authentic [[03:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14037.08s)]
*  Very much so and that's just how [[03:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14039.08s)]
*  I sang since I was [[03:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14041.08s)]
*  A kid [[03:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14043.08s)]
*  And I think if you [[03:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14045.08s)]
*  If you like grow up [[03:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14047.08s)]
*  Doing something [[03:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14049.08s)]
*  And I'm in no way comparing [[03:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14051.08s)]
*  It to anything I'm just saying how that [[03:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14053.08s)]
*  Cuts through like he [[03:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14055.08s)]
*  Played his whole [[03:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14057.08s)]
*  Fucking life [[03:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14059.08s)]
*  If fuck, if he did sell [[03:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14061.08s)]
*  His soul I mean [[03:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14063.08s)]
*  Fuck. I don't think he did [[03:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14065.08s)]
*  He got a good gig but [[03:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14067.08s)]
*  But you know that's the whole [[03:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14069.08s)]
*  The legend. The fun legend [[03:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14071.08s)]
*  The legend. But that's also just [[03:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14073.08s)]
*  When someone stands out like that you're always [[03:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14075.08s)]
*  Going to have those kind of stories. People love to [[03:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14077.08s)]
*  Bullshit. You just keep going and [[03:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14079.08s)]
*  Especially like Stevie. Stevie you could tell [[03:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14081.08s)]
*  When he's playing the guitar. Yeah. Yeah [[03:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14083.08s)]
*  It sounds like Stevie. You can tell [[03:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14085.08s)]
*  But that's just shit you grow up [[03:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14087.08s)]
*  And you have like a little fucking quirk [[03:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14089.08s)]
*  You know like there's a tone that you have [[03:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14091.08s)]
*  Whenever. Yeah. Even when you're first [[03:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14093.08s)]
*  Starting like you don't do something perfectly [[03:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14095.08s)]
*  Correct. Yeah. [[03:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14097.08s)]
*  But then it turns out to be your thing [[03:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14099.08s)]

*  It's crazy how that [[03:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14187.08s)]
*  Happened. And also Jim Morrison [[03:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14189.08s)]

*  Good? How is he 27? [[03:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14195.08s)]
*  Do you know his car is like [[03:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14197.08s)]
*  A source of mystery. There's like [[03:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14199.08s)]
*  One guy claims he has his car [[03:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14201.08s)]
*  But apparently it's the wrong VIN number. [[03:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14203.08s)]
*  But his car, he had a 1967 [[03:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14205.08s)]
*  Shelby GT 500. [[03:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14207.08s)]
*  Cool. And he had it for only like [[03:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14209.08s)]
*  A year or two and then he sold it and then there's [[03:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14211.08s)]
*  A providence of it where people try to track it. Cool. [[03:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14213.08s)]
*  He looks like Jesus Christ. [[03:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14215.08s)]
*  He does. If Jesus Christ was here [[03:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14217.08s)]
*  He'd drive a 1967 Shelby GT 500. [[03:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14219.08s)]
*  If Jesus had to drive [[03:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14221.08s)]
*  I'll tell you what. He wouldn't be driving [[03:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14223.08s)]
*  A minivan. He'd be driving [[03:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14225.08s)]
*  An American Muscle. [[03:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14227.08s)]
*  That's why we would listen. No he'd be driving a Tesla. [[03:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14229.08s)]
*  No, no, no. He would drive a god damn American [[03:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14231.08s)]
*  Muscle car and realize just [[03:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14233.08s)]
*  Plant more trees. They'll eat the gas. [[03:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14235.08s)]
*  Or something. Look at that though. [[03:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14237.08s)]
*  He was so pumped to have [[03:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14239.08s)]
*  That car. Yeah. To just [[03:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14241.08s)]
*  Run next to it. How pumped are you [[03:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14243.08s)]
*  To have that fucking car? I think he filmed something with it. [[03:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14245.08s)]
*  I think he did some sort of a thing [[03:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14247.08s)]
*  Where he filmed himself with the car. [[03:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14249.08s)]
*  Like I don't remember what he did. [[03:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14251.08s)]
*  I remember it was something. But there's [[03:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14253.08s)]
*  Like people have tried to track the car. [[03:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14255.08s)]
*  And there's one gentleman on YouTube who says he [[03:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14257.08s)]
*  Owns it. It's definitely the same exact car. [[03:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14259.08s)]
*  But whether or not that's the one [[03:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14261.08s)]
*  I don't know. The VIN number discrepancy. [[03:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14263.08s)]
*  Yeah. But [[03:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14265.08s)]
*  Back then everything was written down on paper. [[03:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14267.08s)]
*  Who knows what the fuck people. And also [[03:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14269.08s)]
*  If somebody might have changed the VINs. [[03:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14271.08s)]
*  Maybe someone stole it from somebody. [[03:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14273.08s)]
*  I don't fucking know. [[03:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14275.08s)]
*  You're dealing with 50 plus years [[03:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14277.08s)]
*  Of shit going down. Who knows what happened. [[03:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14279.08s)]
*  What's your favorite car? [[03:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14281.08s)]
*  I don't [[03:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14283.08s)]
*  Really have a favorite car. [[03:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14285.08s)]
*  I don't have a favorite specific car. [[03:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14287.08s)]
*  But if I had a favorite kind of car [[03:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14289.08s)]
*  It would be American Muscle cars. [[03:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14291.08s)]
*  Those are my favorite cars. [[03:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14293.08s)]
*  Because those cars, even though they're not [[03:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14295.08s)]
*  The fastest cars. They don't handle the best. [[03:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14297.08s)]
*  Those cars are literally [[03:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14299.08s)]
*  Like a rolling piece of art. [[03:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14301.08s)]
*  You're driving around [[03:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14303.08s)]
*  In this iconic [[03:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14305.08s)]
*  Time machine of art. [[03:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14307.08s)]
*  Someone created this shape. [[03:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14309.08s)]

*  I drove my electric car. [[03:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14345.08s)]
*  That's a Jesus Christ car. [[03:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14347.08s)]
*  Jesus would drive a fucking Shelby. [[03:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14349.08s)]
*  Look at that thing. That is so crazy. [[03:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14351.08s)]
*  A six wheel drive car. [[03:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14353.08s)]

*  Is that fast still? [[03:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14361.08s)]
*  It's fast. It's bumpy. [[03:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14363.08s)]
*  But it's fast. [[03:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14365.08s)]
*  You could probably tow a giant boat with that thing. [[03:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14367.08s)]
*  With all that traction. [[03:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14369.08s)]

*  No shit. The KGB report [[04:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14711.08s)]
*  goes on to say that the remains [[04:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14713.08s)]

*  from that of limestone. [[04:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14735.08s)]
*  It turned them into limestone. [[04:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14737.08s)]
*  Literally into limestone. And this is a [[04:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14739.08s)]
*  CIA paperwork? [[04:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14741.08s)]
*  Well, this is, you know, they're reading from a KGB [[04:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14743.08s)]
*  file, right? So [[04:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14745.08s)]
*  it's just [[04:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14747.08s)]
*  go to the very bottom of that [[04:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14749.08s)]
*  again, Jamie, the very bottom of that. It says one of the [[04:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14751.08s)]
*  things it says, the CIA representative stated [[04:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14753.08s)]
*  if the KGB file [[04:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14755.08s)]
*  corresponds to reality, [[04:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14757.08s)]
*  this is an extremely menacing case. [[04:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14759.08s)]
*  The aliens possess such weapons and [[04:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14761.08s)]
*  technology that go beyond all our assumptions. [[04:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14763.08s)]
*  They can stand up for themselves [[04:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14765.08s)]
*  if attacked. [[04:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14767.08s)]
*  The thing is they're saying if the file [[04:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14769.08s)]
*  corresponds to reality, that means there's a question. [[04:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14771.08s)]
*  If this is real, they're tough. [[04:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14773.08s)]
*  Yeah, they can fuck with you. [[04:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14775.08s)]
*  What year was this released? [[04:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14777.08s)]
*  I don't know. [[04:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14779.08s)]
*  Source is a newspaper. [[04:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14781.08s)]
*  1991? 1993. [[04:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14783.08s)]
*  So, there, [[04:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14785.08s)]
*  you know, there's all these disclosures [[04:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14787.08s)]
*  that are going on right now and they're very, very [[04:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14789.08s)]
*  fascinating because it's hard to know [[04:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14791.08s)]
*  what's true and what's not true. But it's interesting [[04:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14793.08s)]
*  that they're talking about it. But no [[04:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14795.08s)]
*  one showed me anything yet. I'm waiting for them [[04:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14797.08s)]
*  to show me things. I've seen some things already [[04:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14799.08s)]
*  like those videos that they took off [[04:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14801.08s)]
*  the FLIR video [[04:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14803.08s)]
*  and the GoFast video. [[04:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14805.08s)]
*  These videos of these things with these jet [[04:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14807.08s)]
*  fighter pilots trying to track this [[04:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14809.08s)]
*  thing. It's like zipping across the sky. [[04:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14811.08s)]
*  What the fuck is that? I've seen a few [[04:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14813.08s)]
*  of those. I've seen [[04:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14815.08s)]
*  talk to two different fighter pilots [[04:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14817.08s)]
*  that have had encounters. [[04:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14819.08s)]
*  And they're all in. They're all in. [[04:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14821.08s)]
*  I think there's a real thing [[04:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14823.08s)]
*  going on. What that real thing [[04:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14825.08s)]
*  is, is what's [[04:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14827.08s)]
*  confusing to me. I think some of it has to be [[04:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14829.08s)]
*  ours. I think some of it has [[04:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14831.08s)]
*  to be like super advanced drone [[04:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14833.08s)]
*  technology that we [[04:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14835.08s)]
*  don't want everyone knowing about. [[04:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14837.08s)]
*  And it's probably some black ops [[04:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14839.08s)]
*  shit. But I don't think that's all of it. [[04:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14841.08s)]
*  I think it's also possible that we've been visited. [[04:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14843.08s)]
*  It just makes sense. [[04:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14845.08s)]
*  It just it sounds so stupid. [[04:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14847.08s)]
*  That's part of the problem of even [[04:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14849.08s)]
*  talking about it because it sounds dumb. [[04:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14851.08s)]
*  Because there's no evidence. So you have to believe in something [[04:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14853.08s)]
*  where there's no evidence of it other than like some blurry [[04:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14855.08s)]
*  photographs. But [[04:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14857.08s)]
*  but then when you just think about the size [[04:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14859.08s)]
*  of the universe itself [[04:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14861.08s)]
*  and the fact that we exist. [[04:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14863.08s)]
*  We exist here on this planet. We're real. [[04:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14865.08s)]
*  We know we're real. What if it's fucking Amarthar [[04:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14867.08s)]
*  or whatever and they're [[04:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14869.08s)]
*  from fucking the center of the Earth [[04:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14871.08s)]
*  and the holes in the [[04:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14873.08s)]
*  polar, the poles [[04:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14875.08s)]
*  or whatever, north and south. [[04:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14877.08s)]
*  And that's where the holes are. And that's [[04:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14879.08s)]
*  why Google Maps blocks [[04:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14881.08s)]
*  it all out and all that shit. [[04:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14883.08s)]
*  Well, that would be a great theory [[04:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14885.08s)]
*  before cell phones. [[04:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14887.08s)]
*  But it's not there. You still can't see it. [[04:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14889.08s)]
*  But you can with satellites. [[04:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14891.08s)]
*  And also flight patterns. [[04:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14893.08s)]
*  Like the people that... Copy and paste [[04:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14895.08s)]
*  by the way. You know who doesn't think the world is flat? [[04:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14897.08s)]
*  Pilots. [[04:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14899.08s)]
*  True. Or anyone [[04:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14901.08s)]
*  who's been in an airplane. They fly around [[04:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14903.08s)]
*  these motherfuckers. They know [[04:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14905.08s)]
*  where they have to go. They know the flight patterns. [[04:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14907.08s)]
*  You look at it. You see it. Also [[04:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14909.08s)]
*  by the way, everything's round. [[04:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14911.08s)]
*  Go out in the fucking sky and look at [[04:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14913.08s)]
*  Mars, look at Jupiter, [[04:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14915.08s)]
*  get a telescope, look at all the stars. [[04:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14917.08s)]
*  Notice how everything's round. Seems like [[04:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14919.08s)]
*  there's a pattern going on. Why would this [[04:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14921.08s)]
*  be different? This ass is round. [[04:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14923.08s)]
*  I don't know. It's so weird [[04:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14929.08s)]
*  man. I don't know. [[04:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14931.08s)]
*  And you're talking about the oh shit [[04:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14933.08s)]
*  moment. I think we've been so [[04:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14935.08s)]
*  normalized to it. Like ET all this [[04:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14937.08s)]
*  shit. Growing up watching this shit. [[04:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14939.08s)]
*  To where it's like, yeah, no shit. [[04:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14941.08s)]
*  Everyone, no matter what the surveys [[04:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14943.08s)]

*  thinks there's like [[04:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14949.08s)]
*  something going on. [[04:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14951.08s)]
*  Everyone. Yeah. [[04:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14953.08s)]
*  There's a few people that still [[04:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14955.08s)]
*  are very incredulous. [[04:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14957.08s)]
*  Elon, believe it or not, is incredulous. [[04:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14959.08s)]
*  He's famously said, [[04:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14961.08s)]
*  if aliens are really sure, how subtle. [[04:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14963.08s)]
*  Very subtle. Bigfoot's subtle too. [[04:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14965.08s)]
*  It doesn't mean he's not an interdimensional [[04:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14969.08s)]
*  being that could teleport at will. He knows where the [[04:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14971.08s)]
*  cameras are. [[04:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=14973.08s)]

*  That show, [[04:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15001.08s)]

*  That's why I was so disappointed. [[04:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15353.08s)]
*  They're still doing the 2020 [[04:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15355.08s)]
*  because it was supposed to be this year. [[04:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15357.08s)]
*  But I don't know if it's actually [[04:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15359.08s)]
*  There's actually a teaser trailer for it. [[04:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15361.08s)]
*  Because that was my favorite shit [[04:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15365.08s)]
*  as a kid. [[04:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15367.08s)]
*  He's so good. [[04:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15369.08s)]
*  That actor they got [[04:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15371.08s)]
*  to do Blade. He is so good. [[04:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15373.08s)]
*  Uh, this might... [[04:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15383.08s)]
*  What was that? [[04:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15385.08s)]
*  He didn't say that, so this could be a fake trailer. [[04:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15387.08s)]
*  He didn't see that. He did not see that. [[04:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15389.08s)]
*  It could just be lag though. [[04:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15391.08s)]
*  Maybe it's just like a re-upload or something. [[04:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15393.08s)]
*  His mouth didn't move that way. [[04:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15395.08s)]
*  Yeah, not even close. [[04:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15397.08s)]
*  Let it go though. [[04:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15399.08s)]
*  He said that. [[04:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15401.08s)]
*  I'm dying. [[04:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15407.08s)]
*  I'm dying. [[04:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15409.08s)]
*  That looked okay. [[04:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15411.08s)]
*  See, that looked weird. [[04:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15431.08s)]
*  Yeah, that wasn't a real trailer. [[04:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15433.08s)]
*  I think so. [[04:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15435.08s)]
*  I've seen a really good one recently [[04:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15437.08s)]
*  They're actually getting real jobs for making [[04:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15439.08s)]
*  fan edited trailers. [[04:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15441.08s)]
*  That's smart, right? [[04:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15443.08s)]
*  And then you show it to the studio. [[04:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15445.08s)]
*  The studio's like, find that fucking guy. [[04:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15447.08s)]
*  They just take what? [[04:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15449.08s)]
*  From the teaser or whatever [[04:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15451.08s)]
*  and put a song there? [[04:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15453.08s)]
*  You know what drives me crazy? [[04:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15455.08s)]
*  Who decided that that's how music for a trailer has to be? [[04:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15457.08s)]
*  Ba-dum! [[04:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15459.08s)]
*  Ba-dum! [[04:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15461.08s)]
*  Right. [[04:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15463.08s)]
*  Anticipation. [[04:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15465.08s)]
*  It was inception. [[04:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15467.08s)]
*  That was like, bwaaahhh! [[04:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15469.08s)]
*  Bwaaahhh! [[04:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15473.08s)]
*  Right. [[04:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15475.08s)]
*  I don't know. Every movie trailer soundtrack [[04:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15477.08s)]
*  is exactly the same. [[04:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15479.08s)]
*  Every music trailer [[04:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15481.08s)]
*  or movie trailer soundtrack [[04:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15483.08s)]
*  is exactly the same. [[04:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15485.08s)]
*  That's interesting. It's true though. [[04:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15487.08s)]
*  It's true. [[04:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15489.08s)]
*  It's like there's a pattern to get you jazzed up about something. [[04:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15491.08s)]
*  But see, it's starting to wear off. [[04:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15493.08s)]
*  I hear it. [[04:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15495.08s)]
*  Now we need a trailer with no music. [[04:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15497.08s)]
*  Trailers used to be one of my favorite parts [[04:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15499.08s)]
*  to go into the movies. [[04:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15501.08s)]
*  Really? Yeah, man. You got a good trailer. [[04:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15503.08s)]
*  A good solid trailer [[04:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15505.08s)]
*  that sucks you in like, oh shit! [[04:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15507.08s)]
*  That was how you found out about movies back then. [[04:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15509.08s)]
*  Right. [[04:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15511.08s)]
*  You didn't see Oppenheimer yet, right? [[04:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15513.08s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[04:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15515.08s)]
*  They show a trailer for this before and the sound, because you're in the IMAX theater [[04:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15517.08s)]
*  with Oppenheimer, makes this movies... [[04:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15519.08s)]
*  I mean, it already looks good, but the trailer and the audio... [[04:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15521.08s)]
*  Is it the same soundtrack? [[04:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15523.08s)]
*  This is Killers of a Flower Moon. [[04:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15525.08s)]
*  No, it's not at all, but like, just... [[04:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15527.08s)]
*  They added... whoever added this together did a great job. [[04:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15529.08s)]
*  Oh, was this new? Yeah, this comes out later this year. [[04:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15531.08s)]
*  Killers of the Flower Moon. Leo's a beast. [[04:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15533.08s)]
*  My color. [[04:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15537.08s)]
*  They used the sound great. [[04:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15541.08s)]
*  The Osage. [[04:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15543.08s)]
*  They have the worst land possible. [[04:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15545.08s)]
*  But they outsmarted everybody. [[04:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15549.08s)]
*  The land had oil on it. [[04:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15551.08s)]
*  Black gold. [[04:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15553.08s)]
*  Money flows freely here now. [[04:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15555.08s)]
*  I do love that money, sir. [[04:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15557.08s)]
*  This wealth should come to us. [[04:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15569.08s)]
*  Their time is over. [[04:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15575.08s)]
*  This is gonna be another tragedy. [[04:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15577.08s)]
*  When this money start coming... [[04:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15583.08s)]
*  We should have known it came to something else. [[04:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15585.08s)]
*  They're like buzzards circling our people. [[04:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15591.08s)]
*  We're still warriors. [[04:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15595.08s)]
*  I ought to kill these white men. [[04:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15603.08s)]
*  I ought to kill these white men who killed my family. [[04:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15605.08s)]

*  The fucking shower curtain. [[04:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15747.08s)]
*  The shower curtain. [[04:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15749.08s)]
*  Where he sees him and he's like... [[04:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15751.08s)]
*  Just blast him through the shower curtain. [[04:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15753.08s)]
*  I love that movie. [[04:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15757.08s)]
*  That movie has no music in it. [[04:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15759.08s)]
*  I love that. [[04:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15761.08s)]
*  I love that. [[04:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15763.08s)]
*  It's a weird thing where you're [[04:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15765.08s)]
*  listening to music in a scene [[04:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15767.08s)]
*  and it's telling you how to think. [[04:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15769.08s)]
*  Right. [[04:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15771.08s)]
*  Where it kind of takes away a little bit of the [[04:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15773.08s)]
*  suspension of disbelief [[04:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15775.08s)]
*  that you're that character. [[04:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15777.08s)]
*  And that's why I love [[04:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15779.08s)]
*  I love that [[04:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15781.08s)]
*  the contrast [[04:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15783.08s)]
*  the contrast [[04:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15785.08s)]
*  and the juxtaposition of [[04:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15787.08s)]
*  different music [[04:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15789.08s)]
*  than you would expect. [[04:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15791.08s)]
*  Like... [[04:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15793.08s)]
*  And the Django whenever he goes [[04:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15795.08s)]
*  and fucking kills the whole house to Tupac. [[04:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15797.08s)]
*  That shit is so hard. [[04:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15799.08s)]
*  That shit is so hard. [[04:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15801.08s)]
*  Because it's been western music [[04:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15803.08s)]
*  the whole time. [[04:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15805.08s)]
*  That's such a Tarantino move. [[04:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15807.08s)]
*  He always has amazing music choices. [[04:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15809.08s)]
*  For those big [[04:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15811.08s)]
*  culmination scenes [[04:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15813.08s)]
*  what was the song in [[04:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15815.08s)]
*  Once Upon a Time [[04:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15817.08s)]
*  in Hollywood? [[04:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15819.08s)]
*  Whenever everything was fucking going down. [[04:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15821.08s)]
*  Because it always builds up to that one scene [[04:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15825.08s)]
*  with the contrasting music. [[04:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15827.08s)]
*  It is so fucking cool. [[04:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15829.08s)]

*  in a movie theater that we had all rented out. [[04:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15895.08s)]
*  There was no one in it but us. [[04:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15897.08s)]
*  All the comics and the dudes we work with [[04:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15899.08s)]

*  It's also [[04:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15911.08s)]
*  it's such a Tarantino movie. [[04:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15913.08s)]
*  Like the violence in it [[04:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15915.08s)]
*  is so egregious. [[04:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15917.08s)]
*  Like if someone just made a movie [[04:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15919.08s)]
*  But only in that one deal. [[04:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15921.08s)]
*  Right but it's enough. [[04:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15923.08s)]

*  from my movie prop [[04:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15931.08s)]

*  I love that movie. It's such a fun movie [[04:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15955.08s)]
*  too because it's like a reimagining of [[04:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15957.08s)]
*  the Manson murders. Yeah. [[04:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15959.08s)]

*  Like actual [[04:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15965.08s)]
*  or was it like a play off of? [[04:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15967.08s)]
*  I think it was the Manson family [[04:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15969.08s)]
*  coming after him. [[04:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15971.08s)]
*  But he happens to be there. Yeah it was. [[04:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15973.08s)]
*  Yep yep because [[04:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15975.08s)]
*  Tate's in the movie everybody the director [[04:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15977.08s)]
*  his idea. Manson's in the movie briefly. [[04:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15979.08s)]
*  The Italian [[04:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15981.08s)]
*  director that was in the [[04:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15987.08s)]
*  with Sharon [[04:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15989.08s)]
*  Tate. [[04:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15991.08s)]
*  Oh yeah Manson's in that that's right. [[04:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15993.08s)]
*  That's crazy dude. [[04:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15995.08s)]
*  And they go to that ranch. [[04:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15997.08s)]
*  They go to the ranch [[04:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=15999.08s)]
*  and they're looking for the owner of the [[04:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=16001.08s)]
*  and he's sleeping. [[04:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=16003.08s)]
*  He's like, he doesn't feel very good. [[04:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=16004.66s)]
*  That's a crazy movie. [[04:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=16007.14s)]
*  It is a crazy movie. [[04:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=16008.74s)]
*  It's very good. [[04:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=16009.78s)]
*  It's a very good movie. [[04:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=16011.1s)]
*  And that's what they did too. [[04:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=16012.18s)]
*  They whack people for Charlie. [[04:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=16016.82s)]
*  And just, is the ranch story real? [[04:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=16019.02s)]
*  I guess specifically is what I'm thinking about. [[04:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=16023.18s)]
*  What is the actual story? [[04:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=16025.42s)]
*  Like what do they say, that they killed the guy [[04:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=16027.18s)]
*  who owned the ranch and took it over or something? [[04:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=16028.74s)]
*  Yeah, well I guess in the movie. [[04:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=16030.58s)]
*  He's dead. [[04:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=16033.28s)]
*  I don't know if that's based on a real story, [[04:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=16036.039999999999s)]
*  but I bet it is. [[04:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=16038.119999999999s)]
*  I bet that's real. [[04:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=16039.48s)]
*  Or at least if he's not dead, [[04:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=16040.68s)]
*  he's just fucking fucked up out of his mind. [[04:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=16042.82s)]
*  Like just, they gave him all the drugs in the world. [[04:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=16047.199999999999s)]
*  But I think there were some cases of like [[04:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=16051.24s)]
*  girls honeypotting dudes and then the other [[04:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=16053.56s)]
*  Manson family guys would come over [[04:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=16056.4s)]
*  and it would turn into a shit show. [[04:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=16058.84s)]
*  I think that's what happened with Brian Wilson [[04:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=16060.88s)]
*  and Dennis Wilson, his manager. [[04:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=16062.32s)]
*  They became entrenched with Charles Manson. [[04:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=16064.42s)]
*  And I think Dennis, we brought up this the other day, [[04:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=16069.42s)]
*  Dennis Wilson was his manager at one point or something. [[04:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=16071.74s)]
*  Was gonna produce a record for him or something like that. [[04:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=16074.14s)]
*  And it went sour. [[04:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=16077.94s)]
*  And then now you have the fucking head [[04:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=16079.34s)]
*  of the Manson family who hates you. [[04:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=16083.06s)]
*  Who wants to kill you. [[04:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=16085.38s)]
*  Brian, same Brian Wilson? [[04:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvBKI3B0HCg&t=16087.619999999999s)]
