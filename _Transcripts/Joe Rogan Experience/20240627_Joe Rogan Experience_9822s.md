*  I said to somebody, I said I'm going to Austin to do the mothership. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=60.0s)]
*  He says, wow, that's going to be a long flight. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=66.0s)]
*  You're flying through Boston to go to Africa? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=69.0s)]

*  I'm like, yeah, mothership, you know, like George Clinton, the mother, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=83.0s)]
*  you know, in parliament and all that. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=86.0s)]

*  Well, it's new. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=90.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's dope, though. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=92.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=93.0s)]
*  Yeah, we've been open four months now. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=94.0s)]
*  It's been wild. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=95.0s)]
*  And it's like, I see it's a line all the time. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=96.0s)]
*  Other comedians send me pictures of people lined up like they go [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=100.0s)]
*  to see Star Wars the first time. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=103.0s)]
*  It's hard to get tickets. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=106.0s)]
*  People get amped up about it. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=107.0s)]
*  It's really nice. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=109.0s)]
*  I like it. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=111.0s)]
*  The grand room is dope, too. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=112.0s)]
*  Yeah, we set it up. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=113.0s)]
*  I mean, we basically set up everything to make it perfect for stand up. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=114.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=118.0s)]
*  You know, just perfect for the comics, perfect for the staff. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=119.0s)]
*  I've been in clubs and they go, yeah, we put our heart and soul into this. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=122.0s)]
*  I'm like, you guys do comedy? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=126.0s)]
*  No, we don't do comedy, but this is our new club. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=127.0s)]
*  I'm like, this is clubs. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=129.0s)]
*  You don't want to say that. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=131.0s)]
*  You don't know what you're doing. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=132.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=133.0s)]
*  I went to this one club and they had this, the stage, the ceiling is like that. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=134.0s)]
*  So it sounds like you're in gymnasium. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=139.0s)]
*  It's like that. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=141.0s)]
*  And the bar is right there. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=142.0s)]
*  And just people order and drinks while the show's going on. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=144.0s)]
*  They got like a tier up here. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=149.0s)]
*  It's more like a dance club. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=151.0s)]
*  It looks like, yeah, like bandstand, American bandstand or something. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=153.0s)]
*  You know, it'd be dope as a club. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=156.0s)]
*  Well, there's not a lot of clubs that are designed by comedians where the [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=159.0s)]
*  comic comes in and says, you know, we need to fix this. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=163.0s)]
*  We need to do that. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=165.0s)]
*  We had Louie come in, too. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=167.0s)]
*  That helped a lot. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=168.0s)]
*  Louie gave me some real good advice, real good tips. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=169.0s)]
*  I listened to everything he said. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=172.0s)]
*  I said, let's do this. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=173.0s)]
*  Okay, I'll do that. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=174.0s)]
*  He's like, make the stage in the small room smaller. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=175.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=178.0s)]
*  How much smaller? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=179.0s)]
*  Four feet on each side. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=180.0s)]
*  Chopped it up. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=181.0s)]
*  It was like right before we poured the concrete, too. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=182.0s)]
*  So they had to change the rebar and all that jazz. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=183.0s)]
*  But it's perfect. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=185.0s)]
*  When you like from the stage, I give advice on like, I might, you know, you poke fun at the club. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=186.0s)]
*  You talk shit and like the owners always say, you know how much money I put into this club? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=195.0s)]
*  Like, yeah. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=199.0s)]
*  You don't do stand up, man. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=200.0s)]
*  You don't know what you're doing. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=202.0s)]
*  You don't know what you're doing. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=203.0s)]
*  And when I said it, people laughed. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=204.0s)]
*  So but then sometimes you rip on a club because it's comfortable and you rip on it and then they'll go and fix it. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=207.0s)]
*  Like, dude, what you doing? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=213.0s)]
*  Don't clean it up, man. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=214.0s)]
*  What you doing? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=216.0s)]
*  Like the punchline Atlanta. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=217.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=219.0s)]
*  Did you ever do that? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=220.0s)]
*  I did that one, yeah. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=221.0s)]
*  They cleaned it up. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=222.0s)]
*  And it's they moved. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=223.0s)]
*  But it was like one of those clubs like the ice house in Pasadena. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=226.0s)]
*  They fixed that up, too. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=229.0s)]
*  Apparently, it's real nice. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=230.0s)]
*  But you would go to those places and it's just like they had a feel. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=232.0s)]
*  They had that those like the wall and zanies. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=235.0s)]
*  We see those headshots from 1983. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=237.0s)]
*  Like there's a cup in Baltimore. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=240.0s)]
*  It's a comedy factory. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=242.0s)]
*  My first five minutes was on how dusty the velvet curtain was. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=244.0s)]
*  But that was dope. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=249.0s)]
*  You come in and it's like that. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=250.0s)]
*  And then they cleaned it up. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=253.0s)]
*  New thing. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=255.0s)]
*  New jokes. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=256.0s)]
*  Comedy is dirty, son. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=260.0s)]
*  Yeah, some comedies dirty. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=262.0s)]
*  Yeah. Good. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=264.0s)]
*  Well, it's a painful thing. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=265.0s)]
*  I tell people I say the periodic chart, the symbol for comedy is a banana pill. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=266.0s)]
*  That means somebody got to get hurt. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=272.0s)]
*  The crowd might laugh, but somebody's don't go. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=274.0s)]
*  How many people got fucked up over banana peels to the point where banana peels became a thing like you just know if you leave a banana peel on the ground, people getting fucked up. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=279.0s)]
*  It's like literally the only item where if it's on the you could describe it and there was a banana peel on the ground. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=289.0s)]
*  Oh, that's it. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=295.0s)]
*  Someone's getting fucked up by a banana. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=296.0s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=298.0s)]
*  One hundred percent of the time. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=299.0s)]
*  And then next thing you know, the ambulance guy is telling you, you got STD. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=300.0s)]
*  Well, that's what it sounded like when I hurt my back that time. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=305.0s)]
*  He said you got a sciatica. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=309.0s)]
*  I'm like, how did I? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=311.0s)]
*  I knew she was dirty. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=312.0s)]
*  But sciatica sounds like something else. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=313.0s)]
*  I just threw that in there. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=317.0s)]
*  I see what you just did. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=319.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=321.0s)]
*  I can't hear myself at all. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=322.0s)]
*  You don't like it? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=324.0s)]
*  No. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=325.0s)]
*  Like, yeah. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=326.0s)]
*  Is it too much? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=327.0s)]
*  We don't have to wear these. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=328.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=329.0s)]
*  If you feel more comfortable, take them off. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=330.0s)]
*  I'm good. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=331.0s)]
*  I'm going to do it like that. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=332.0s)]
*  I'm going to do it like that. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=333.0s)]
*  Because I'm always the first one to feel something like right now. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=336.0s)]
*  And you guys don't have it here, but we got the smoke and stuff. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=339.0s)]
*  And they say it's the smoke. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=343.0s)]
*  How bad is it? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=344.0s)]
*  It's real bad, man. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=345.0s)]
*  It's like this bad. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=346.0s)]
*  Why is it orange? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=347.0s)]
*  Has anybody tried to figure that out? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=349.0s)]
*  Because you know all the conspiracy theories, Gene. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=351.0s)]
*  I know a guy. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=353.0s)]
*  Do you know the conspiracy theories? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=354.0s)]
*  Because apparently there was a bunch of chemicals that went missing. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=356.0s)]
*  I know a guy. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=359.0s)]
*  I know a guy who used to be the NBC doc. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=360.0s)]
*  You know what NBC is. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=363.0s)]
*  So Camp Lejeune, the Marines have to go through a gas chamber. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=364.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=368.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=369.0s)]
*  And I'm a corpsman. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=370.0s)]
*  So you can only do it once a quarter. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=371.0s)]
*  But the good thing is you get a three-day weekend. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=373.0s)]
*  So I would volunteer to do it. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=376.0s)]
*  So I think I did it a couple of too many times. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=379.0s)]
*  Not a lot, but I would. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=382.0s)]
*  OK, maybe once a month. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=384.0s)]
*  But you know what I'm saying? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=386.0s)]
*  Them three-day weekends are good. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=388.0s)]
*  And I didn't care. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=389.0s)]
*  Because after a while you kind of get used to it. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=390.0s)]
*  But when I smell that smoke, I'm like, I know what trees and leaves smell like, man, when they burn it. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=392.0s)]
*  That's not how it doesn't smell like that. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=399.0s)]
*  What does it smell like? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=401.0s)]
*  Chemicals. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=402.0s)]
*  NBC. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=404.0s)]
*  It's called Nuclear Biological Chemical Warfare. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=405.0s)]
*  And Marines, everybody in the military, you have to go there. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=408.0s)]
*  You go in and you put your mask on. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=411.0s)]
*  You say, I'm Joe Rogan. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=414.0s)]
*  Because you have to be able, like, when the gas comes, you don't already have your mask on. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=419.0s)]
*  You got to think fast, put it on. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=423.0s)]
*  And so as a corpsman, but you already got your mask on as a corpsman. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=425.0s)]
*  But it's still getting in there. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=430.0s)]
*  So for health reasons, you should do it once a quarter. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=432.0s)]
*  You were doing it once a month. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=435.0s)]
*  Once every other month, something like that. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=437.0s)]
*  Just for the three day weekends. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=439.0s)]
*  Just for the three day weekend, man. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=443.0s)]
*  You know, I understand. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=445.0s)]
*  I volunteered because I had allergies real bad. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=446.0s)]
*  I volunteered to go up to Norfolk for these, they would be up there for like a week and they give you shots and do this and do that. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=449.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=459.0s)]
*  And I was talking to this guy one time who was in my unit. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=461.0s)]
*  I said, yeah, man, I went from five, ten, six, one, in like a year. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=465.0s)]
*  He says, yeah, would you let him shoot you up with all that shit? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=469.0s)]
*  Who's he giving them? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=473.0s)]
*  He's a grown man. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=475.0s)]
*  He's a grown man. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=477.0s)]
*  They were just trying shit out on him. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=478.0s)]
*  I got five days off, man. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=480.0s)]
*  I always thought they were doing that kind of stuff. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=482.0s)]
*  Like, I don't know what they give people. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=485.0s)]
*  But haven't you ever heard, there's always been stories about people giving people like crazy experimental drugs. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=487.0s)]
*  Well, in the military, you just, you got your gear in your hand. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=494.0s)]
*  You just walk through and there's a corpsman on both sides. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=497.0s)]
*  We just pop you. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=500.0s)]
*  Well, if I had a bunch of soldiers, especially like special operators, like Navy SEALs, I would want them to be juiced up. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=503.0s)]
*  I would want that. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=510.0s)]
*  Everybody's juiced up. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=511.0s)]
*  I would want them to be on amphetamines. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=512.0s)]
*  I would want them to be on steroids. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=514.0s)]
*  We don't, I didn't really know what we was on. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=516.0s)]
*  We just say, shit, we're taking shots today. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=519.0s)]
*  Hey, does my voice sound fucked up? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=522.0s)]
*  Does it sound like I'm lisping a little bit? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=524.0s)]
*  It does, right? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=526.0s)]
*  I have an Invisalign in. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=528.0s)]
*  I'm getting my teeth straightened out. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=530.0s)]
*  Let me see. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=532.0s)]
*  I can't really see. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=534.0s)]
*  But this is the first day I've had it on. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=536.0s)]
*  Now that you said it, I can tell. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=539.0s)]
*  So my question is, do I try to work through this? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=540.0s)]
*  Because they say that eventually your tongue figures out how to talk. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=543.0s)]
*  I don't think you sound that different. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=546.0s)]
*  I'm getting better at it. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=548.0s)]
*  See, you can hear it right there. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=550.0s)]
*  First you can't hear it. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=552.0s)]
*  It's like your tongue has to, even though it's the tiniest little amount of plastic, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=554.0s)]
*  your tongue has to figure out where that is. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=558.0s)]
*  And then it has to kind of like pull back a little bit. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=560.0s)]
*  It's going to change your accent. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=562.0s)]
*  I'm not going to wear it on stage. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=564.0s)]
*  That would be fucked. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=566.0s)]
*  Impossible. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=567.0s)]
*  Because there'll be certain things that you say, and a certain way you say them. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=568.0s)]
*  And then you're going to go, am I going to say them like that? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=571.0s)]
*  My lower teeth have always been crooked, and I've always been like, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=574.0s)]
*  I'm going to say them like that. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=577.0s)]
*  Yeah, see, my lower teeth have always been crooked, and shit gets stuck in them. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=578.0s)]
*  It's really hard to floss them. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=581.0s)]
*  The dentist is like, listen, you don't have to wear braces. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=583.0s)]
*  You can just do this thing, and it takes a long time. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=586.0s)]
*  It takes over a year. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=590.0s)]
*  I don't think you sound that different. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=591.0s)]
*  I do a little. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=592.0s)]
*  If you're a person who's easily annoyed, I apologize. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=593.0s)]
*  I'm going to figure this out. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=596.0s)]
*  You're good. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=598.0s)]
*  I'm going to figure this out. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=599.0s)]
*  I'm telling you, I got fucked up by ants. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=600.0s)]
*  So here's the fire. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=601.0s)]
*  Oh, OK, there's the fire. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=602.0s)]
*  This is the last map of the last day or so. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=604.0s)]
*  Now, the conspiracy theory is that there's a shit ton of toxic waste, toxic chemicals rather, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=609.0s)]
*  that went missing. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=617.0s)]
*  Remember those? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=618.0s)]
*  Yes, sort of, yeah. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=619.0s)]
*  And the conspiracy theory is they burned them, and that's why the smoke was orange. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=621.0s)]
*  Where did they burn them? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=626.0s)]
*  Up in Canada. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=627.0s)]
*  But it's definitely not trees burning. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=628.0s)]
*  It's not trees burning. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=630.0s)]
*  Well, the thing is... [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=631.0s)]
*  And how's it going and coming? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=632.0s)]
*  The winds. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=633.0s)]
*  But the thing is, if you have a fire that's that big, for sure there's some stuff around [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=634.0s)]
*  the fire other than just trees. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=639.0s)]
*  For sure they're burning down buildings. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=641.0s)]
*  It's not a lot in Canada up there. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=643.0s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=645.0s)]
*  I believe. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=646.0s)]
*  I remember hearing that most of the population lives near the border. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=647.0s)]
*  That makes sense. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=650.0s)]
*  I'd say it's a high percentage of it. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=651.0s)]
*  Where's Winnipeg at? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=653.0s)]
*  He's supposed to be dead in the center somewhere. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=655.0s)]
*  Bro, those fucking Albinos. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=658.0s)]
*  Those people that can live up in that cold weather, those are different people. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=660.0s)]
*  They like it. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=664.0s)]
*  They laugh at Detroit. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=665.0s)]
*  They're like, this isn't cold. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=667.0s)]
*  You think Michigan is cold? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=669.0s)]
*  Come on up to Alberta. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=671.0s)]
*  And everybody's just walking around with Levi's jacket. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=672.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=674.0s)]
*  But you get used to it. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=675.0s)]
*  You wear the right clothes. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=677.0s)]
*  You make the most of it. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=679.0s)]
*  It was very weird that video where they all started at the same time. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=680.0s)]
*  What's that? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=683.0s)]
*  Where all the fires started at the exact same time it looked like. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=684.0s)]
*  Little weird. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=686.0s)]
*  Pretty weird. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=687.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=688.0s)]
*  And it was right after the balloon. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=689.0s)]
*  I heard the explanation to that was like lightning storms, which does happen. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=690.0s)]
*  What about the balloon that got shot down or something like that? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=693.0s)]
*  That sounds weirder to me as an explanation. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=696.0s)]
*  What are they saying started this fire? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=698.0s)]
*  They're not. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=700.0s)]
*  They're not saying it all? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=701.0s)]
*  I haven't heard anybody say what started. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=703.0s)]
*  They just say it's a fire in Canada. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=705.0s)]
*  Wear a mask. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=707.0s)]
*  Dry, hot weather breeds more lightning. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=708.0s)]
*  Half the wildfires are started by lightning, but those fires are started by lightning. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=710.0s)]
*  Half the wildfires are started by lightning, but those fires account for more than 85% of the wildfire destruction. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=714.0s)]
*  The other half are human-caused. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=719.0s)]
*  So how many animals are dead? [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=721.0s)]
*  Oh, they're pretty good at getting the fuck away. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=723.0s)]
*  If it's just woods, I bet you'd be surprised at how few die. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=726.0s)]
*  They're really good at getting away. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=730.0s)]
*  This article right here just said this in April only displaced 30,000 people. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=732.0s)]
*  So it's like there's not a lot of people up there. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=736.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=738.0s)]
*  But it's fucking huge, right? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=739.0s)]
*  It's been going on for how many months now? [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=741.0s)]
*  This is as of Friday. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=742.0s)]
*  I mean, this was... [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=743.0s)]
*  427 active wildfires? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=744.0s)]
*  I mean, this says this was today. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=747.0s)]
*  232 of them are out of control. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=749.0s)]
*  232 fires in Canada are out of control. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=751.0s)]
*  They're trying to burn down Canada. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=754.0s)]
*  They just burn until they run into water or just... [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=756.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=759.0s)]
*  Well, I think when things get this big, there's not much they can do. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=760.0s)]
*  I mean, they can do their best to try to contain it. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=766.0s)]
*  Shutting down production of oil and gas. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=769.0s)]
*  I mean, you haven't been back east? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=774.0s)]
*  You haven't seen it? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=776.0s)]
*  I heard it's horrible. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=777.0s)]
*  It's really bad. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=778.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=779.0s)]
*  It's really bad. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=780.0s)]
*  It's going to last for a long time, too. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=781.0s)]
*  This fire is fucking huge. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=783.0s)]
*  I can see. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=786.0s)]
*  It's like multiple Los Angeles' on fire. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=788.0s)]
*  And that's how it looks sometimes. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=791.0s)]
*  It looks like LA. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=793.0s)]
*  It's just... [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=794.0s)]
*  It's like that. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=795.0s)]
*  It's like that. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=796.0s)]
*  Brother, worst I ever experienced was Mexico City. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=797.0s)]
*  We flew into Mexico City and I took photos out my window. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=800.0s)]
*  I was like, this is crazy. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=803.0s)]
*  The amount of smoke those people live in on a regular basis, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=805.0s)]
*  the amount of pollution there is horrible. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=808.0s)]
*  It says, I've never seen a vertical wall of smoke like this one [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=810.0s)]
*  near Fox Creek, Alberta on Sunday. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=813.0s)]
*  And the strangest thing about this moment was I couldn't smell any smoke. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=816.0s)]
*  Well, I guess the wind hadn't got to me. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=822.0s)]
*  If the wind's not going in that direction, you can smell it. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=824.0s)]
*  Well, he can smell smoke. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=827.0s)]
*  It's just he couldn't smell trees burning [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=828.0s)]
*  because I don't smell trees burning. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=830.0s)]
*  Is that what he's saying, though? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=832.0s)]
*  Because also, you do... [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=834.0s)]
*  Look at the smoke. Look at how it looks. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=836.0s)]
*  But that for sure is smoke, too. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=838.0s)]
*  Those trees are burning. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=840.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=841.0s)]
*  What is that? [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=842.0s)]
*  Trees look pretty good. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=843.0s)]
*  Can you imagine if it really is how they got rid of those chemicals? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=845.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=848.0s)]
*  They decided to light the forest on fire? [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=849.0s)]
*  That would be the dumbest way to get rid of those chemicals. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=851.0s)]
*  I don't even know, like... [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=854.0s)]
*  In what way? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=856.0s)]
*  Like, they sprayed them and then someone started a fire? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=857.0s)]
*  Why would you do that? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=859.0s)]
*  Like, what would be... [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=860.0s)]
*  I can understand why someone would think it's a conspiracy, right? [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=861.0s)]
*  The chemicals go missing and then, you know, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=864.0s)]
*  there's this fire and the smoke looks orange. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=867.0s)]
*  I get how people would put those two together. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=870.0s)]
*  But my question would be, like, why would anybody do that? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=872.0s)]
*  Why would anybody light all those chemicals on fire in the woods? [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=875.0s)]
*  Here's what it made New York City look like. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=879.0s)]
*  Imagine like that's how they started. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=881.0s)]
*  Somebody else might have done it. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=883.0s)]
*  Right. Maybe. Look at that. That's bonkers. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=884.0s)]
*  But imagine that is how you choose to get rid of chemicals. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=887.0s)]
*  Like, it's not... You know what I mean? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=892.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's why I like this. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=894.0s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=895.0s)]
*  It would have fucked up everybody. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=896.0s)]
*  It fucked up everybody. And you're lighting... [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=898.0s)]
*  You have to be the craziest psychopath of all time. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=900.0s)]
*  You're lighting the woods on fire to get rid of some chemicals. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=903.0s)]
*  I'm thinking maybe it wasn't their woods that they set on fire. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=907.0s)]
*  Somebody else's woods. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=912.0s)]
*  No, someone else from somewhere else. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=913.0s)]
*  Someone set someone... Yeah. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=916.0s)]
*  Yeah, maybe. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=917.0s)]
*  We'll get those motherfuckers. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=918.0s)]
*  Right. But why the chemicals? That's the question. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=919.0s)]
*  Like, if it is the chemicals, what kind of conspiracy is that? [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=922.0s)]
*  Go to 4chan. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=926.0s)]
*  Wasn't it near where the balloon was? Remember the balloon? [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=928.0s)]
*  The balloon was like... [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=931.0s)]
*  It was right in that area. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=933.0s)]
*  Where was the balloon flying over? [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=934.0s)]
*  There was a few places. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=936.0s)]
*  It started in the Northwest and started making it across the country, I think. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=937.0s)]
*  They said they had a bunch of those while Trump was in office, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=941.0s)]
*  and they didn't tell him about it. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=944.0s)]
*  Because they were worried he was going to shoot them down. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=946.0s)]
*  They also showed that laser, that footage of that laser shooting down on the Hawaiian coastline. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=948.0s)]
*  Yeah, what was that? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=952.0s)]
*  That makes me think of the fires. It's like, whatever that is... [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=953.0s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=955.0s)]
*  Imagine if they could just light the fucking woods on fire to make us comply. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=956.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=959.0s)]
*  Stay in your homes. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=960.0s)]
*  That makes less sense to me. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=962.0s)]
*  Download this app. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=963.0s)]
*  Why? [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=964.0s)]
*  You must now download this app. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=965.0s)]
*  Put it in your fingerprints. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=967.0s)]
*  We've got to make sure that we track all your matches purchases. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=969.0s)]
*  That's the next thing we've got to do. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=972.0s)]
*  It's kind of crazy that you can just buy a lighter. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=974.0s)]
*  Like anybody could go buy a lighter and just start lighting shit on fire. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=976.0s)]
*  You just can't take it through TSA. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=980.0s)]
*  You can't take a lighter through TSA? [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=982.0s)]
*  No. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=984.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=985.0s)]
*  Really. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=986.0s)]
*  Is that new? [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=987.0s)]
*  No. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=988.0s)]
*  Matches, though, right? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=989.0s)]
*  Yeah, matches. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=990.0s)]
*  But if it's sitting in your carry-on, they take... [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=991.0s)]
*  You ever see that little bucket of lighters? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=993.0s)]
*  You can take disposables with out-fuel. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=995.0s)]
*  Disposable and Zippo lighters without fuel. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=998.0s)]
*  Oh, without fuel. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1000.0s)]
*  Oh, you have to take... [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1002.0s)]
*  They took my really nice Zippo. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1003.0s)]
*  But disposables are this. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1005.0s)]
*  This is a disposable. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1006.0s)]
*  Lighters with fuel are prohibited in checked bags. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1007.0s)]
*  Checked bags. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1009.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1010.0s)]
*  Okay, disposable and Zippo. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1011.0s)]
*  So the Zippos without fuel are allowed in checked bags. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1012.0s)]
*  How do you know it doesn't have fuel? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1015.0s)]
*  And disposables are allowed in checked bags. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1016.0s)]
*  So that's checked bags, though. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1017.0s)]
*  The one they took for me was a gift. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1019.0s)]
*  I didn't even put the stuff in it yet. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1021.0s)]
*  It was in a gift box. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1022.0s)]
*  You know, with the little... [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1024.0s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1025.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1026.0s)]
*  They took that? [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1027.0s)]
*  They took that. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1028.0s)]
*  Oh, that's scary. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1029.0s)]
*  I don't think they're supposed to take it if it doesn't have any fuel in it. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1030.0s)]
*  It was brand new. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1032.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think they're allowed to take that. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1033.0s)]
*  I think they fucking robbed you. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1035.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1036.0s)]
*  Yeah, they're like, look what I got. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1037.0s)]
*  I came up. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1038.0s)]
*  Final decision rests with the TSA officer on whether the item is allowed through the checkpoint. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1040.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1045.0s)]
*  Yeah, some of them are cool and some of them are not. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1046.0s)]
*  I remember when they made pool cues illegal. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1048.0s)]
*  You couldn't take a pool cue on board, but you could take a skateboard. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1050.0s)]
*  I'm like, you're not going to fuck you up with a skateboard. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1054.0s)]
*  Way better than I could fuck you up with a pool cue. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1056.0s)]
*  You know? [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1059.0s)]
*  And pool cues give you a little more speed to it. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1060.0s)]
*  What about an umbrella? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1062.0s)]
*  Can you take an umbrella? [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1063.0s)]
*  You can take an umbrella. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1064.0s)]
*  You can take a fucking cane. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1065.0s)]
*  Yeah, both of them. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1066.0s)]
*  A cane? [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1068.0s)]
*  Like, you could fuck somebody up with a cane. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1069.0s)]
*  And there's a lot of canes that have swords in them now. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1071.0s)]
*  Yeah, my mom got that one. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1073.0s)]
*  That one's crazy. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1074.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1075.0s)]
*  Some dude with a limp and a cane. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1076.0s)]
*  No, somebody gave it to her, but they didn't know what it was. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1077.0s)]
*  She didn't know? [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1080.0s)]
*  No. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1081.0s)]
*  Just happened to twist it and I'm like, whoa. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1082.0s)]
*  Sheesh. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1084.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1085.0s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1086.0s)]
*  She's got it at the house right now. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1087.0s)]
*  That's nice. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1088.0s)]
*  You see your mom on the porch sharpening. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1089.0s)]
*  Zing, zing, zing. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1091.0s)]
*  You don't know who you fucking with. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1093.0s)]
*  Yeah, carrying a sword. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1095.0s)]
*  That's some next level shit. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1096.0s)]
*  An undercover sword in a cane. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1098.0s)]
*  What's the name of the place? [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1100.0s)]
*  The place you used to go get like, ears pierced and they were in the mall. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1103.0s)]
*  Oh, right, right, right. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1108.0s)]

*  Spencer's, yeah. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1110.0s)]
*  Yeah, somebody gave her a cane from Spencer's. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1111.0s)]
*  Wow. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1113.0s)]
*  Spencer Gifts cane had a sword in it? [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1114.0s)]
*  They had the sword. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1117.0s)]
*  They're selling weapons? [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1118.0s)]
*  Well, this was... [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1119.0s)]
*  Back in the 80s. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1120.0s)]
*  You could do shit like that. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1121.0s)]
*  Not in the 80s. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1122.0s)]
*  She didn't need a cane in the 80s. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1123.0s)]
*  This was... [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1124.0s)]
*  It had to be the 2000s. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1125.0s)]
*  I remember you used to be able to go to Chinatown and buy throwing stars. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1128.0s)]
*  The little green things. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1132.0s)]
*  Yeah, remember those? [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1133.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1134.0s)]
*  We still have throwing stars. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1135.0s)]
*  We go out to the woods and fuck trees up. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1136.0s)]
*  There's a comedian who used to have those stars. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1139.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1141.0s)]
*  His name was Willie Robocop. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1142.0s)]
*  He's a comedian from D.C. who lives in London. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1143.0s)]
*  And did he do something with them on stage? [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1146.0s)]
*  No, off stage he had the stars. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1148.0s)]
*  Him and another comedian got into it one time and he had those things out. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1151.0s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1155.0s)]
*  They didn't throw it though. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1156.0s)]
*  They was... [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1157.0s)]
*  That's a scary proposition though. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1158.0s)]
*  A dude who's really good at throwing stars. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1160.0s)]
*  They roll out a little belt or something in there. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1167.0s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1171.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm all around your waist. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1172.0s)]

*  He's got them all around his waist. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1175.0s)]
*  I think he's a martial arts guy too. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1177.0s)]
*  He's seen him before. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1179.0s)]

*  He's all over the UK. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1194.0s)]
*  You ever do it over there in the UK? [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1195.0s)]
*  Yeah, I just did the O2. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1197.0s)]
*  I did the arena up there. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1198.0s)]

*  It's like a little... [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1234.0s)]
*  Like a restaurant. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1235.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1237.0s)]

*  His show was right over there. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1362.1599999999999s)]
*  I bet I mean he was, you know, right over there. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1363.1599999999999s)]

*  Wild. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1384.28s)]
*  Yeah, never mind. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1387.28s)]
*  I'm not saying. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1388.28s)]
*  Weirdly. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1389.28s)]
*  I was thinking about the spaceship up there. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1393.28s)]
*  I remember one of the presidents that we had here, he was doing like a tour at Air Force [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1395.28s)]
*  Base and the guy says, this is a stealth fighter. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1400.88s)]
*  He goes, yeah, it's invisible, like Wonder Woman's plane. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1402.88s)]
*  You don't remember he said that? [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1407.88s)]
*  No. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1408.88s)]
*  He said that. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1409.88s)]
*  Well, he's incorrect. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1410.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1411.88s)]
*  He says they call it the stealth fighter because it gets invisible like Wonder Woman's plane. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1413.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, you just can't see it on radar, but you can look at it. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1420.2800000000002s)]
*  It's right there. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1422.48s)]
*  I wasn't the president. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1423.48s)]
*  Wonder Woman plane would like go transparent so you could see the clouds. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1424.48s)]
*  That's next level shit. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1428.0800000000002s)]
*  They're going to do that for sure because they already have clothes that can do that. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1429.0800000000002s)]
*  They have like a cloak that you can wear and the cloak will like transmit an image of what's [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1433.5600000000002s)]
*  behind you. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1438.8400000000001s)]
*  Ever seen that? [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1439.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, like a LCD or LED screen. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1441.8s)]
*  It's really interesting. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1445.6s)]
*  Like they figured out how to do some weird stuff that makes it look like someone's invisible [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1446.6s)]
*  and things are invisible. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1453.6399999999999s)]
*  And it seems like a matter of time before they can apply that at a higher level. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1454.6399999999999s)]
*  Like, look at that. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1459.04s)]
*  That lady's like standing right in front of something. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1460.04s)]
*  Did you ever do Bruce Harris Club before it was the Stardome? [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1463.4399999999998s)]
*  No. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1466.6399999999999s)]
*  Before it was the Stardome, he had a whatever the screen is. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1468.44s)]
*  Can you keep that up? [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1475.0400000000002s)]
*  What is that object she's using to do that? [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1476.6000000000001s)]
*  Is that a thing she's holding in front of her? [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1481.0s)]
*  It seems like she's holding a screen. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1483.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1485.64s)]
*  And it looks like she has camo pants on. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1486.64s)]
*  So that's a little misleading. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1491.92s)]
*  So she's got camo pants on standing in front of that tree and then the thing is showing [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1493.8799999999999s)]
*  the image of the tree behind her. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1498.56s)]
*  Wow. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1500.76s)]
*  Yeah, they could apply that to a plane, for sure. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1501.76s)]
*  And then with the stealth technology, can't see it. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1505.72s)]
*  The predator did that. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1507.76s)]
*  Remember the predator? [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1508.76s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1509.76s)]
*  That's what he did. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1510.76s)]
*  That's exactly the thing on his wrist. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1511.76s)]
*  The language, the alien language. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1515.76s)]
*  Boy, if that's what the aliens are like, we're fucked. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1517.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1520.76s)]
*  He's on a hunting trip. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1521.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1522.76s)]
*  He was no different than you. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1523.76s)]
*  He was just going to kill some animals. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1524.76s)]
*  Yeah, but he's just taking their heads. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1526.76s)]
*  He's just rude. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1527.76s)]
*  I eat them. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1528.76s)]
*  He doesn't even eat them. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1529.76s)]
*  Kills all those nice people. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1531.76s)]
*  Doesn't even eat them. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1532.76s)]
*  What do you think about big game hunters? [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1533.76s)]
*  Do people go to Africa? [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1539.76s)]
*  Africa is a very complicated situation because Africa has more wild game right now than [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1541.76s)]
*  any time over the last few decades. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1551.76s)]
*  And the reason why they have that is because they made it very valuable. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1553.76s)]
*  So these people set up these large wild game camps and the people from all over the world [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1556.76s)]
*  come there and they pay a lot of money and they hunt. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1562.76s)]
*  And they can hunt anything. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1564.76s)]
*  Wildebeest, giraffes. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1566.76s)]
*  They can take it with them, right? [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1567.76s)]
*  They can't bring it back with them. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1568.76s)]
*  And they can eat the meat while they're there and they'll donate the meat to the villages, [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1570.76s)]
*  which they very much appreciate. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1575.76s)]
*  My friends have been over there and said it is actually a very nice feeling. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1577.76s)]
*  What about lions? [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1580.76s)]
*  They don't do that. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1581.76s)]
*  Nope, they don't eat the lions. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1582.76s)]
*  No. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1583.76s)]
*  Lions is just... [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1584.76s)]
*  It's just like to say you hunted a lion. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1587.76s)]
*  The thrill of hunting a lion. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1590.76s)]
*  And then there's the conservation aspect of it. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1592.76s)]
*  They do have to kill a certain amount of lions. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1594.76s)]
*  They have a population control that they do. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1596.76s)]
*  So remember when Cecil the lion got killed and everybody freaked out? [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1599.76s)]
*  They shut down lion hunting and then they had a surplus of lions. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1603.76s)]
*  And then lions were killing too much antelope and undulates. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1607.76s)]
*  So then they had to send in hunters, like professional killers, to kill the lions. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1610.76s)]
*  Do you remember this movie that Kurt Douglas was in? [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1614.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1617.76s)]
*  The Ghost in the Darkness. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1618.76s)]
*  So come to find out. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1620.76s)]
*  That's a true story. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1621.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1622.76s)]
*  And they did the thing on the lions. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1623.76s)]
*  And one of the lions, he had an injury. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1624.76s)]
*  He had hurt his jaw, his tooth or something. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1630.76s)]
*  Like a real bad... [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1632.76s)]
*  Like a bullet hole? [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1633.76s)]
*  No. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1634.76s)]
*  Like biting something big. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1635.76s)]
*  He broke a tooth. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1637.76s)]
*  And so that's why he was hunting humans because... [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1639.76s)]
*  It's easier. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1641.76s)]
*  Yeah, easier. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1642.76s)]
*  It's like eating cotton candy as opposed to that. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1643.76s)]
*  Right. Eating a rhino. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1646.76s)]
*  The other one was fine, but I guess that was like, [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1647.76s)]
*  all right, man, you're on this special diet. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1649.76s)]
*  I'm on it with you, son. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1651.76s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1653.76s)]
*  Let's go get these motherfuckers. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1654.76s)]
*  Well, once you eat us, it's probably so easy. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1656.76s)]
*  If we don't taste absolutely terrible... [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1659.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1661.76s)]
*  The lion pair was said to have killed 135 people. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1662.76s)]
*  Boom. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1666.76s)]
*  Holy shit. 1898. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1667.76s)]
*  And tell them why his... [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1669.76s)]
*  Because one of them had... [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1671.76s)]
*  Yeah, right there. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1672.76s)]
*  So his little lion breath probably stunk like shit. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1673.76s)]
*  Stunk. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1676.76s)]
*  It said the Sabo man-eaters are the most widely studied [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1677.76s)]
*  man-eating pantherine cats, given their behavior of [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1679.76s)]
*  hunting humans as a pair as well as dental injuries [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1683.76s)]
*  reported in one of the lions, a cause commonly [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1686.76s)]
*  attributed to big cats turning to humans as prey. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1689.76s)]
*  And these dudes was weird too, [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1693.76s)]
*  because they didn't have mane. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1695.76s)]
*  They were both males. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1697.76s)]
*  Oh, like that? Is that what they looked like? [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1699.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1701.76s)]
*  Wow. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1702.76s)]
*  How come they didn't have manes? [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1703.76s)]
*  Yeah, so they were equivalent of a guy with a big butt. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1704.76s)]
*  No. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1708.76s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1709.76s)]
*  But why didn't they have manes? [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1711.76s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1713.76s)]
*  That's so strange. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1714.76s)]
*  Yeah, these two dudes was... [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1715.76s)]
*  Does it say anything about why they didn't have manes? [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1717.76s)]
*  That's so fascinating. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1721.76s)]
*  Yeah, no manes and his breath. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1723.76s)]
*  I thought all the males had manes. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1725.76s)]
*  And these two dudes, so they were already outcasts, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1727.76s)]
*  no manes, bad breath. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1731.76s)]
*  Yeah, they got nothing. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1734.76s)]
*  They had to go down to a railroad track and eat some dudes. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1736.76s)]
*  Imagine, you know, you're spending your whole life [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1738.76s)]
*  trying to kill a zebra. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1741.76s)]
*  They're fast as fuck. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1742.76s)]
*  You got to sneak up on them. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1743.76s)]
*  You got to get them. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1744.76s)]
*  And then you find these people like, oh, Jesus! [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1745.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1747.76s)]
*  They can't even run. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1748.76s)]
*  They'll stumble over their own feet. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1749.76s)]
*  They're wearing shoes. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1750.76s)]
*  You just take them out. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1751.76s)]
*  And like, oh, my God, this is so much easier. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1752.76s)]
*  We can get fat. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1754.76s)]
*  Yeah, and no work. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1755.76s)]
*  They don't have to run. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1756.76s)]
*  No work. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1757.76s)]
*  No work. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1758.76s)]
*  Wow, it's just like... [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1759.76s)]
*  They can't even see at night. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1760.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1761.76s)]
*  These morons. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1762.76s)]
*  And they were all railroad workers or something like that. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1763.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1766.76s)]
*  You just wait until someone has to piss. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1767.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1769.76s)]
*  Sobble males look different as well. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1770.76s)]
*  The most vigorous Serengeti males sport large manes, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1772.76s)]
*  while the Savo, they have short, thin manes or not at all. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1775.76s)]
*  It's all about water, Patterson says. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1778.76s)]
*  Savo is hotter and drier than the Serengeti, [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1780.76s)]
*  and a male with a heavy mane would squander his daily water allowance [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1783.76s)]
*  by simply panting under a bush with none to spare [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1787.76s)]
*  for patrolling his territory, hunting, or finding mates. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1790.76s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1793.76s)]
*  That's why they was rocking ball heads. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1794.76s)]
*  That's wild. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1796.76s)]
*  I did not know that. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1797.76s)]
*  So are there lions like that right now [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1799.76s)]
*  that are there? [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1801.76s)]
*  See if you can find male lions out there with no manes. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1802.76s)]
*  Wow. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1806.76s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1808.76s)]
*  I didn't know that existed. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1809.76s)]
*  Well, have you guys been watching Chimp Empire? [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1811.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1814.76s)]
*  I had the guy in it who directed it. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1815.76s)]
*  How many years did that take? [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1817.76s)]
*  Look at them. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1819.76s)]
*  Well, here's the deal. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1820.76s)]
*  Scientists had set up research there 30 years ago. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1821.76s)]
*  So they had been continually studying these chimps, [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1826.76s)]
*  and they had very specific rules of engagement. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1829.76s)]
*  You can't ever eat in front of them. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1832.76s)]
*  You can't be closer than 20 feet. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1834.76s)]
*  Or was it 20 yards? [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1836.76s)]
*  20 yards. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1837.76s)]
*  You can't be closer than 20 yards. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1838.76s)]
*  They were right there with them. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1840.76s)]
*  So they're right there with these chimps, man. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1842.76s)]
*  And so they're filming everything, [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1844.76s)]
*  and the chimps get accustomed to the people being there [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1846.76s)]
*  because the people never interact with the chimps. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1849.76s)]
*  And if the chimps walk towards the people, [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1851.76s)]
*  the people just back away. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1853.76s)]
*  And again, you can never eat in front of them, ever. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1855.76s)]
*  Because they just steal your food and fuck you up. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1858.76s)]
*  What blew me away was when they ate monkeys. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1860.76s)]
*  I was like, dude, that's okay. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1863.76s)]
*  They ate a lot of monkeys. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1865.76s)]
*  Yeah, David Attenborough, I think, was the first guy [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1867.76s)]
*  to capture that on film on the BBC, [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1870.76s)]
*  and I remember watching that. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1873.76s)]
*  You see this little monkey, and he's still alive. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1875.76s)]
*  And the chimp is eating him from the asshole first. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1878.76s)]
*  And I always thought that they were vegetarians. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1881.76s)]
*  I thought they were like gorillas. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1884.76s)]
*  Gorillas don't eat meat. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1886.76s)]
*  No, they don't eat meat. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1887.76s)]
*  I thought it was just the baboons. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1888.76s)]
*  I thought they were the only one who ate. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1892.76s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't know either until I watched that documentary, [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1894.76s)]
*  but they eat a lot of monkeys. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1897.76s)]
*  And this is one of the things that he was kind of reluctant [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1899.76s)]
*  to talk about, the director. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1901.76s)]
*  I'm like, how often do they eat monkeys? [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1903.76s)]
*  He's like... [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1905.76s)]
*  All the time. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1906.76s)]
*  Every time they can. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1908.76s)]
*  Every time they can. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1909.76s)]
*  It's like, with us, it's like fast food, [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1911.76s)]
*  like literal fast food. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1913.76s)]
*  There you go. There you go. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1915.76s)]
*  I was thinking they ate them because they had tails, [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1918.76s)]
*  so they don't consider them apes. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1921.76s)]
*  I don't think they have morals. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1924.76s)]
*  I think it's just survival and fitness. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1926.76s)]
*  They eat somebody from the ass backwards. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1928.76s)]
*  And the way the monkey was screaming, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1930.76s)]
*  the chimp was just... [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1933.76s)]
*  They're so close to us. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1935.76s)]
*  So when we see them getting eaten, [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1938.76s)]
*  even though we're getting eaten by something [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1940.76s)]
*  that's even closer to us, [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1942.76s)]
*  it still is like, what? [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1943.76s)]
*  But people eat monkeys. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1945.76s)]
*  That's a lot of the tribes' people. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1947.76s)]
*  A pigeon eating chicken. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1949.76s)]
*  Right. Right. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1951.76s)]
*  Or chickens eating birds. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1953.76s)]
*  They eat birds. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1955.76s)]
*  Well, I guess birds of prey eat other birds, too. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1957.76s)]
*  Oh, yeah. All the time. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1959.76s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, there's crazy videos of seagulls. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1961.76s)]
*  Seagulls are... [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1964.76s)]
*  They're just swallowing whole pigeons. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1966.76s)]
*  Have you ever seen them do that? [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1969.76s)]
*  They swallow ducks. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1970.76s)]
*  Yeah, they just... [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1971.76s)]
*  Just... [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1972.76s)]
*  Pelicans? [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1973.76s)]
*  Pelicans swallow ducks. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1974.76s)]
*  I know pelicans. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1976.76s)]
*  Pelicans swallow seagulls. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1977.76s)]
*  Yeah, pelicans are big as shit. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1978.76s)]
*  They're so big. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1980.76s)]
*  When they swallow shit, it's crazy, [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1982.76s)]
*  because the thing realizes that it got caught. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1984.76s)]
*  You see it moving around inside of its mouth, [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1986.76s)]
*  and it can't do shit about it. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1989.76s)]
*  See if you can find, like, pelican eats pigeon. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1990.76s)]
*  But what about on that Chimp Empire [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1995.76s)]
*  when they got the leader? [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=1999.76s)]
*  They got him. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2001.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2002.76s)]
*  And all his boys ran. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2003.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2004.76s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2005.76s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2006.76s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2008.76s)]
*  Look at him throwing that thing back. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2009.76s)]
*  Oh, he's still scratching. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2011.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2012.76s)]
*  Well, it's still in there. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2013.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2014.76s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2015.76s)]
*  Oh, he's in Central Park somewhere? [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2016.76s)]
*  I don't know where that is. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2018.76s)]
*  It looks like it. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2020.76s)]
*  Yeah, it looks like people just walking by. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2021.76s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2023.76s)]
*  Look at him forcing it down. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2024.76s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2026.76s)]
*  Get in there, bitch. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2027.76s)]
*  That bird's moving around inside of his neck. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2028.76s)]
*  Oh. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2031.76s)]
*  Have you ever seen a seagull eat a rat? [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2032.76s)]
*  Uh-uh. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2036.76s)]
*  Ever seen a seagull eat a rat? [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2037.76s)]
*  That's more impressive. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2039.76s)]
*  Seagulls eating rats, it's wild. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2041.76s)]
*  They just throw them all back. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2043.76s)]
*  I mean, seagulls get them. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2044.76s)]
*  There's a seagull eats a rabbit, rat, pigeon, squirrel. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2045.76s)]
*  Let's go with rat. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2048.76s)]
*  It's the most disturbing. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2049.76s)]
*  My voice does sound a little fucked up. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2050.76s)]
*  I think I'm going to have to take these out. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2053.76s)]
*  Oh, is that cat going to eat that bird? [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2055.76s)]
*  No, this is a seagull that's going to eat a rat. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2057.76s)]
*  Look at him throwing this bitch back. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2060.76s)]
*  Look at it. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2062.76s)]
*  Just throwing it back. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2063.76s)]
*  Come on. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2065.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2066.76s)]
*  It probably tastes nasty, too. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2067.76s)]
*  And he's like, Jesus Christ, I can't believe I'm doing this. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2069.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2072.76s)]
*  Yeah, how long do you think you can eat, [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2073.76s)]
*  swallow a rat's hole, and live? [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2076.76s)]
*  I mean, how many of those can eat before this? [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2079.76s)]
*  Oh, look, an any girl can buy this car. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2082.76s)]
*  Your whole body is just filled with toxins. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2084.76s)]
*  And that rat was dead. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2087.76s)]
*  Oh, yeah, probably for a long time. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2089.76s)]
*  And probably dead with poison. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2090.76s)]
*  Poison, yeah. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2091.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2092.76s)]
*  Yeah, that's one of the things that happens at the Hollywood Hills. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2093.76s)]
*  They kill a lot of owls, inadvertently, [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2097.76s)]
*  because they're poisoning the rats, and the rats are running around. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2100.76s)]
*  The owls eat the rats. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2103.76s)]
*  The owls get poisoned. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2104.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2106.76s)]
*  We have overrun of rats in D.C. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2108.76s)]
*  And the rats behave like squirrels. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2112.76s)]
*  They just pop out. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2115.76s)]
*  They don't give a... [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2116.76s)]
*  Yeah, but people are training their dogs. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2118.76s)]
*  Do you go after rats? [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2121.76s)]
*  Do you go after rats? [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2122.76s)]
*  I know you guys seen that video. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2123.76s)]
*  Yeah, but your dog can get rabies. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2125.76s)]
*  Your dog can get all kinds of shit. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2127.76s)]
*  I mean, most likely, well, most likely your dog will fuck up a rat. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2128.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2131.76s)]
*  And they're saying for people to please curb your dog, [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2132.76s)]
*  because the dogs eat dog food, which is high in protein, [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2135.76s)]
*  and the rats eat... [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2138.76s)]
*  Oh, man. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2140.76s)]
*  Whoa, this hawk got that rat. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2141.76s)]
*  It's still fucking running. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2143.76s)]
*  His legs are still running. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2144.76s)]
*  Hawks are fucking awesome. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2145.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2146.76s)]
*  They're so awesome. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2147.76s)]
*  He just starts ripping it apart. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2150.76s)]
*  He's a boy. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2153.76s)]
*  There's a ton of videos of eagles killing birds. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2154.76s)]
*  Oh! [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2156.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2157.76s)]
*  Oh, boy. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2158.76s)]
*  Son. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2159.76s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2160.76s)]
*  Play that again. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2161.76s)]
*  Play that part again. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2162.76s)]
*  Oh! [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2163.76s)]

*  Oh! [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2166.76s)]
*  Give me that bitch. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2167.76s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2168.76s)]
*  He's just going yummity yummity. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2169.76s)]
*  There's no morals involved in this. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2170.76s)]
*  There's no thinking, no nerves, no remorse. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2172.76s)]
*  That's got to be a hard way to go to. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2177.76s)]
*  That's a hard way to go. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2179.76s)]
*  Because you're in shock. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2180.76s)]
*  All of a sudden, these giant hands with claws that dig into your rib cage, [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2181.76s)]
*  and you already know you're dead. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2186.76s)]
*  That thing's grabbing you and it's flying off with you, [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2188.76s)]
*  you already know you're dead. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2190.76s)]
*  You're suffocating because he's way up there. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2191.76s)]
*  Well, you're breathing out from your ribs, too. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2193.76s)]
*  You've got holes in your ribs now. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2195.76s)]
*  You've probably got a punctured lung. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2196.76s)]
*  They're crushing you. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2198.76s)]
*  Just go ahead and eat me already, motherfucker. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2199.76s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2201.76s)]
*  I'm on my way here today. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2202.76s)]
*  A bird dropped out of the sky when I was at a red light, [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2204.76s)]
*  and I was like, what the fuck was that? [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2207.76s)]
*  Tesla recorded it. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2209.76s)]
*  Let me find out later. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2210.76s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2211.76s)]
*  I think a bigger bird got a bird, [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2212.76s)]
*  and its friends were trying to get it back. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2216.76s)]
*  And they dropped it. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2219.76s)]
*  The bigger one just dropped it. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2220.76s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2221.76s)]
*  Because I could see other birds flying around as I went by. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2222.76s)]
*  Yeah, bird on bird warfare is going on all the time. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2224.76s)]
*  If you just throw out stuff for the seagulls, [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2227.76s)]
*  you give it to one of them, and they go, [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2229.76s)]
*  no, bitch, give me that. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2231.76s)]
*  And they're just like, they're old fighters. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2232.76s)]
*  I was watching a bunch of crows chase off a hawk. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2234.76s)]
*  There was all these crows that were swarming in on this hawk [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2237.76s)]
*  trying to get the fucking hawk out of there. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2241.76s)]
*  There's a hawk that will eat their babies. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2243.76s)]
*  Get out of here, bitch. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2245.76s)]
*  But hawks, as far as flying maneuver, [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2246.76s)]
*  the falcon is the one who can maneuver real good. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2250.76s)]
*  They're really fast. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2253.76s)]
*  The falcon's really fast. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2254.76s)]
*  Yeah, where's the hawk? [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2255.76s)]
*  They come and dive bomb it like 200 miles an hour. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2256.76s)]
*  The hawk's more like a vet. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2258.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2260.76s)]
*  He just, yeah. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2261.76s)]
*  But he can't. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2262.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2263.76s)]
*  He'll turn into a hawk. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2264.76s)]
*  Well, they just swarm on him. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2265.76s)]
*  Just fuck with him until he quits, [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2266.76s)]
*  until he's burning off so much energy and he's so worried out. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2268.76s)]
*  He's like, I'll go find something else to eat. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2271.76s)]
*  Have you ever done the comedy festivals in Australia? [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2273.76s)]
*  No. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2279.76s)]
*  Man, so it's me and Al Lubele. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2280.76s)]
*  You know Al Lubele? [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2282.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2283.76s)]
*  We were walking. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2284.76s)]
*  And it looks like when Batman, you know, [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2285.76s)]
*  when they do the bat symbol. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2288.76s)]
*  Uh-huh. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2290.76s)]
*  Because you're just looking down at the ground. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2291.76s)]
*  We had no idea about the fruit bats in Australia. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2292.76s)]
*  You know, they're like this big. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2295.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2297.76s)]
*  So you walk in and it's just like, you see that, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2298.76s)]
*  must be a nightclub or something. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2300.76s)]
*  And then you see a whole bunch of them. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2302.76s)]
*  You know, look up and like, Al, look at that. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2303.76s)]
*  And me, Al Lubele, grill bars, and Al's freaking out. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2306.76s)]
*  And he's like, ah! [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2311.76s)]
*  He's cold over his head and stuff. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2312.76s)]
*  And it was just swimming by. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2314.76s)]
*  Look how big they are. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2317.76s)]
*  They're like chihuahuas. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2318.76s)]
*  Are they really that size? [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2320.76s)]
*  They are big. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2322.76s)]
*  Look at this big motherfucker. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2323.76s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2324.76s)]
*  Is that person holding one? [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2325.76s)]
*  And they're right in the city. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2326.76s)]
*  Scroll down a little, Jamie. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2327.76s)]
*  No worries. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2328.76s)]
*  See, they're right in the city. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2329.76s)]
*  They're not. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2330.76s)]
*  Look at the size of that thing. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2331.76s)]
*  You don't have to go to the woods to see these motherfuckers. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2332.76s)]
*  Look at that guy holding one, the lady holding one on the top. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2334.76s)]
*  Look at the size of these things. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2336.76s)]
*  Look, and that's right at her, [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2338.76s)]
*  that's not in the wilderness. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2340.76s)]
*  That's right downtown Sydney. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2341.76s)]
*  Wow. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2343.76s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2344.76s)]
*  What do those things eat? [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2345.76s)]
*  Fruit. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2347.76s)]
*  Look at them. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2348.76s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2349.76s)]
*  Literally like flying chihuahuas. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2350.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2353.76s)]
*  Australia is a wild place. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2354.76s)]
*  So we were there and they have a big gala for the comedians. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2356.76s)]
*  And it's right in Chinatown. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2362.76s)]
*  And they say, hey, be careful because the triad is over there, [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2364.76s)]
*  the little gang members. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2368.76s)]
*  But they dress like they're in a video. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2370.76s)]
*  They don't look like they should fight with what they got on. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2372.76s)]
*  They got like little suits and shit like that. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2376.76s)]
*  So me being the big tough American, I'm like, yo, I walk into the car. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2378.76s)]
*  Because she has a train on her dress and everything. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2383.76s)]
*  It's a black tie thing. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2386.76s)]
*  And we're walking to the car. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2387.76s)]
*  And I saw the biggest rat ever coming down the alley. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2389.76s)]
*  He's just galloping right towards me. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2393.76s)]
*  I'm like, yo, look at the rat. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2395.76s)]
*  And she looks over and she goes, oh. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2397.76s)]
*  But by then, Tony was gone. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2400.76s)]
*  And she's just, I can't believe you ran. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2402.76s)]
*  I can't believe you didn't run. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2406.76s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2408.76s)]
*  I didn't know it was opossum, their possum. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2409.76s)]
*  Oh, right. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2412.76s)]
*  It's like a giant monkey rat. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2414.76s)]
*  And he's coming down the alley. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2416.76s)]
*  And I'm trying to tell her, like, come on, come on, come on. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2419.76s)]
*  And she's more worried about her shoes and shit. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2422.76s)]
*  My dog got one of those in the yard the other day and it played dead. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2426.76s)]
*  He just left it there. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2430.76s)]
*  A real possum, American possum. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2431.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2432.76s)]
*  They have the creepiest faces. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2433.76s)]
*  But they do play possum. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2436.76s)]
*  Yeah, they play possum. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2438.76s)]
*  And it works. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2439.76s)]
*  I watched a video the other day of one getting attacked, Australian possums. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2440.76s)]
*  Yeah, that's what she said. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2445.76s)]
*  She said, aw. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2447.76s)]
*  That's a cute little guy. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2448.76s)]
*  Fuck that dude, man. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2450.76s)]
*  Look at his little pink little nose. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2451.76s)]
*  He was coming down the alley. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2452.76s)]
*  He was coming. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2454.76s)]
*  Running at you. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2455.76s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2456.76s)]
*  That's pretty big. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2457.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2458.76s)]
*  That's pretty big. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2459.76s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2460.76s)]
*  And it's dark. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2461.76s)]
*  It's dark. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2462.76s)]
*  A giant rat. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2463.76s)]
*  Yeah, giant rat. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2464.76s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2465.76s)]
*  Look at his eyes. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2466.76s)]
*  Red eyes. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2467.76s)]
*  Look at his eyes. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2468.76s)]
*  Rabies. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2469.76s)]
*  I'm going to get rabies in London. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2470.76s)]
*  Fuck this. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2471.76s)]
*  I told her, I said, I'll fight them dudes. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2472.76s)]
*  I said it out loud. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2473.76s)]
*  I'll fight them dudes. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2474.76s)]
*  But she waited right until the last moment and looked over and go, aw. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2475.76s)]
*  Tony was gone. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2482.76s)]
*  Peace, bitch. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2484.76s)]
*  I saw a video of a coyote. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2486.76s)]
*  He gets a possum. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2490.76s)]
*  The possum plays possum. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2491.76s)]
*  And while the possum's laying there, the coyote pisses on it and then walks away. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2493.76s)]
*  Like, he left it there. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2497.76s)]
*  Why did he do that? [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2499.76s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2500.76s)]
*  I guess he just wanted to, like, killed it. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2501.76s)]
*  He's like, good, I got it. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2504.76s)]
*  Let me just leave it there. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2505.76s)]
*  I'll eat it later. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2506.76s)]
*  Let it rot out a little bit. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2507.76s)]
*  So he snatches it and it just plays dead. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2509.76s)]
*  It stops moving. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2514.76s)]
*  So he's like, oh, all right. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2515.76s)]
*  I guess it's dead. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2516.76s)]
*  So he moves it around a little bit. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2517.76s)]
*  It's playing dead. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2519.76s)]
*  So he thinks it's really dead. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2520.76s)]
*  So he pisses on it. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2521.76s)]
*  Just to mark it? [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2523.76s)]
*  Yeah, watch. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2524.76s)]
*  Gets over it. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2525.76s)]
*  It's like, okay, this is mine, bitch. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2526.76s)]
*  Somebody comes by. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2528.76s)]
*  I'm going to let these motherfuckers know. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2529.76s)]
*  Should I piss on my food? [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2531.76s)]
*  Yeah, I probably should. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2532.76s)]
*  Let me piss on it real quick. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2534.76s)]
*  He just pissed on his food. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2536.76s)]
*  He's just killed it. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2538.76s)]
*  He's pissing on his lunch. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2539.76s)]
*  Maybe that helps the food break down. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2541.76s)]
*  Maybe it's a marinade of some sort. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2545.76s)]
*  Does he leave it there? [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2547.76s)]
*  He just left it there. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2549.76s)]
*  Because that's what they do a lot of times with cats. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2550.76s)]
*  They'll kill them and then they'll come back later [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2552.76s)]
*  and eat them when they're stiff. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2554.76s)]
*  I think they like them a little maggoty. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2555.76s)]
*  When they stink. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2557.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2558.76s)]
*  I think, well, a lot of animals do that. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2559.76s)]
*  They bury their food after they kill it. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2561.76s)]
*  Because I guess it's like curing meat or something. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2563.76s)]
*  Well, I would imagine it gets a lot more moist [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2567.76s)]
*  or a lot more tender [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2570.76s)]
*  if all the meat is breaking down. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2572.76s)]
*  It's not as gamey. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2574.76s)]
*  Ew. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2575.76s)]
*  I think they're probably just, well, maybe they develop a taste for it. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2577.76s)]
*  Who is this animal on the internet the other day? [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2582.76s)]
*  He's just the baddest little dude. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2586.76s)]
*  Honey badger. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2588.76s)]
*  You ever see one of them? [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2589.76s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2590.76s)]
*  I saw one. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2591.76s)]
*  He fights a lot. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2592.76s)]
*  He's just an asshole. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2593.76s)]
*  He's just a pretty little dude. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2594.76s)]
*  Ferocious little animal. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2596.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2598.76s)]
*  This is good, man. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2599.76s)]
*  Because I have problems with animals all the time. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2601.76s)]
*  You have problems with animals? [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2604.76s)]
*  I don't know, man. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2606.76s)]
*  I got attacked by what's it called? [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2607.76s)]
*  Pig meat goats? [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2610.76s)]
*  Really? [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2612.76s)]
*  Goats are mean sometimes. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2613.76s)]
*  This was like a children's thing. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2614.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2616.76s)]
*  And we're in London and it was kind of embarrassing. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2617.76s)]
*  As a matter of fact, it was me, Brad John, [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2619.76s)]
*  and the round guy, and Stu Kamens. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2621.76s)]
*  And we're in the children's zoo of London. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2624.76s)]
*  And we walk by. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2627.76s)]
*  I'm the only Virgo. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2628.76s)]
*  And this little monkey jumped on the thing. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2630.76s)]
*  He just started screaming right at me. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2633.76s)]
*  I'm like, really, dude? [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2636.76s)]
*  You're going to do that? [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2637.76s)]
*  You're going to fucking do that right here? [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2638.76s)]
*  You're going to fucking do that, you bastard. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2640.76s)]
*  And then we go to feed the little goats, [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2643.76s)]
*  the little pebbles. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2646.76s)]
*  And I had on these red Nikes. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2647.76s)]
*  And every little goat in that motherfucker just started going crazy. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2649.76s)]
*  Then again, I was the asshole again because I kicked one. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2653.76s)]
*  I was like, yo. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2656.76s)]
*  Oh. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2657.76s)]
*  And then they knew you kicked them. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2658.76s)]
*  And so then they came after you. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2660.76s)]
*  The kids were like, the little kids, [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2661.76s)]
*  because the goats were just making a beeline for my sneakers. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2663.76s)]
*  Trying to eat them? [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2666.76s)]
*  Just chewing on them and just fucking with them. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2667.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2671.76s)]
*  Brad John, he was crying. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2672.76s)]
*  Because he does this when he laughs. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2674.76s)]
*  I saw him the other day. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2677.76s)]
*  He looks like Miami Vice. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2679.76s)]
*  What's he doing these days? [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2681.76s)]
*  He's Bender. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2683.76s)]
*  You didn't know that? [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2685.76s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2687.76s)]
*  He's Bender. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2688.76s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2689.76s)]
*  Futurama. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2690.76s)]
*  Oh. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2691.76s)]
*  He's been Bender the whole time. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2692.76s)]
*  I don't even know. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2694.76s)]
*  What's Futurama? [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2695.76s)]
*  It's a cartoon. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2696.76s)]
*  The cartoon, right? [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2697.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2698.76s)]
*  I never watched that show. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2699.76s)]
*  I heard it's really good. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2700.76s)]
*  When you hear his voice, you go, oh shit. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2701.76s)]
*  See, look at Johnny. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2703.76s)]
*  Oh, look at that. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2704.76s)]
*  They were funny together, man. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2705.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2707.76s)]
*  Red Johnny the Round Guy was a funny combination. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2708.76s)]
*  It was a funny combination, too. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2710.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2711.76s)]
*  If I knew it was going to be this type of party. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2712.76s)]
*  Remember how you used to say that? [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2714.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2716.76s)]
*  It's funny when you know guys as long as we have. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2717.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2721.76s)]
*  You know? [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2722.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2723.76s)]
*  Look at him. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2724.76s)]
*  Kids. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2725.76s)]
*  I mean, Tony, I've known you for like 30 years. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2726.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2728.76s)]
*  Isn't that wild? [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2729.76s)]
*  What was it? [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2730.76s)]
*  When I first came to New York, it was at 91. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2731.76s)]
*  I just got released from the military. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2734.76s)]
*  And that one week I did a Carolines Comedy Hour and Def Jam. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2738.76s)]
*  Wow. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2742.76s)]
*  And I was like, boy, this Carolines is going to work out for me. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2743.76s)]
*  I had no idea a Def Jam was going to blow like that, man. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2746.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2751.76s)]
*  And I, well, yeah, speaking of animals, I had done something on Showtime. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2752.76s)]
*  It's called Leslie Nielsen National Lampoon Comedy Playoffs. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2757.76s)]
*  And it was, they pick a comedian from all over the country, go out to Vegas. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2761.76s)]
*  We stayed in the Sahara Hotel because my last name is Woods. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2765.76s)]
*  I had a suite. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2769.76s)]
*  So the other guys had a regular room. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2771.76s)]
*  I had a suite. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2774.76s)]
*  But on that show, I tell a joke about Bigfoot. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2775.76s)]
*  I never saw Bigfoot, but I was, we were on training. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2780.76s)]
*  You do these training where you go make maps and all this shit. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2785.76s)]
*  And we heard him. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2788.76s)]
*  You heard Bigfoot? [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2789.76s)]
*  Heard Bigfoot. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2790.76s)]
*  I heard him. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2791.76s)]
*  What does it sound like? [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2792.76s)]
*  I can still do that. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2794.76s)]
*  He does that. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2796.76s)]
*  But everything you see on them stupid TV shows, that happened. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2797.76s)]
*  He threw a rock. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2801.76s)]
*  All the animals started running. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2803.76s)]
*  And the Marine, because he's the guy who knows where the markers are, but we didn't know where the markers were. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2805.76s)]
*  He's the one who says, hey, we're out of perimeter. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2810.76s)]
*  Have you guys ever heard of Bigfoot? [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2813.76s)]
*  He tells us. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2815.76s)]
*  He was Native American. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2816.76s)]
*  But he just said that. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2817.76s)]
*  Where were you guys? [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2819.76s)]
*  What state? [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2820.76s)]
*  Like Nova Scotia. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2821.76s)]
*  Nova Scotia. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2822.76s)]
*  Where they do cold weather training. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2823.76s)]
*  And you have to make your own map. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2825.76s)]
*  You sure they weren't fucking with you? [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2827.76s)]
*  I'm pretty sure. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2829.76s)]
*  Who threw that rock? [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2830.76s)]
*  Somebody that was fucking with you? [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2831.76s)]
*  No. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2833.76s)]
*  Why the fuck would the animals do it? [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2834.76s)]
*  All the animals ran to. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2836.76s)]
*  Remember how you said, they know how to get away? [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2837.76s)]
*  All these fuckers just, they just did a little mass exodus. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2839.76s)]
*  And it's a very skeptical Bigfoot. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2843.76s)]
*  I've never seen him. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2846.76s)]
*  But I never heard nothing like that either. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2848.76s)]
*  So what, if you had, did it sound like? [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2850.76s)]
*  It just sounded, it was. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2852.76s)]
*  What was it similar to? [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2854.76s)]
*  You ever hear Luther Vandross sing live? [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2856.76s)]
*  No. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2859.76s)]
*  Like when you hear him on a record, it's one thing. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2860.76s)]
*  But when you hear him live, he's like that. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2865.76s)]
*  He didn't sound like that. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2869.76s)]
*  But it was the same. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2871.76s)]
*  Power. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2872.76s)]
*  Power, like hair on the back of your neck. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2873.76s)]
*  What the fuck? [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2875.76s)]
*  Well, you know, bears do that. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2877.76s)]
*  Bears, especially when, what time of the year was it? [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2878.76s)]
*  It was winter. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2882.76s)]
*  Because you listen to the wind, it sounds like a train coming. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2884.76s)]
*  You have to determine where the wind is coming from. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2889.76s)]
*  And get like on a tree or something. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2891.76s)]
*  Because a lot of the icicles are coming like darts. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2893.76s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2897.76s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2898.76s)]
*  And that night we were joking, I was joking around about it [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2899.76s)]
*  and everything. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2903.76s)]
*  And one of the officers said, you know, I'm going to go [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2904.76s)]
*  and one of the officers says, you know, this is a facility. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2907.76s)]
*  And you know, we don't hurt your comedian. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2910.76s)]
*  We don't make, basically you can't go on stage and go, [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2912.76s)]
*  hey, guess where I was at? [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2916.76s)]
*  So I was just, in the joke, I'm just camping. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2918.76s)]
*  Oh, I see. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2922.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2924.76s)]
*  But there's nobody in the military. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2925.76s)]
*  And in the joke, I actually do see Bigfoot. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2927.76s)]
*  It's out fighting big. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2930.76s)]
*  So tell me, so how did it happen? [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2932.76s)]
*  What was going on? [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2935.76s)]
*  What were the circumstances? [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2936.76s)]
*  Lay it out for me. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2938.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2939.76s)]
*  You have, you get, because it's cold and it's raining. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2940.76s)]
*  So we're like in a little circle. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2944.76s)]
*  And it's kind of raining, kind of sleeting. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2947.76s)]
*  And we're talking about, you know, we're going to do this and do that. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2949.76s)]
*  Because we're comparing shit and everybody's fucking up. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2952.76s)]
*  We found our third marker first. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2955.76s)]
*  Like it's supposed to be like a two or three day thing, right? [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2958.76s)]
*  And the good teams, like you do it in the classroom for a couple days. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2962.76s)]
*  And then a team goes out, team come back, team goes out. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2965.76s)]
*  And some of the guys who weren't as good as us in the classroom were coming right back in two days. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2968.76s)]
*  They just spent the night, spent one night and came back. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2973.76s)]
*  Shit, man, we was on our third day, dawg. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2976.76s)]
*  And then our first marker was the third marker. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2979.76s)]
*  But he couldn't help us. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2982.76s)]
*  But then after we heard that, he's like, look, you guys fucked up. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2984.76s)]
*  So we just, because we all. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2988.76s)]
*  So how long did it take in total? [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2990.76s)]
*  How long did it take in total? [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2992.76s)]
*  We left right after that, dawg. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2994.76s)]
*  He told us, he didn't want to be there in the morning. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=2996.76s)]
*  We wanted to be there. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3000.76s)]
*  So yeah, it's a lot of fudging going on. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3002.76s)]
*  Oh, OK. So he said, yeah, good enough. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3005.76s)]
*  So you guys were out there and explained to me what happened and who was telling you that it's Bigfoot. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3007.76s)]
*  Well, we all heard it. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3014.76s)]
*  Everybody's like, what the fuck? [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3015.76s)]
*  And then everything's running, deer, everything's just like scurrying. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3017.76s)]
*  But we heard the ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3021.76s)]
*  You know how you throw a stick through the branches? [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3023.76s)]
*  He just threw it through. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3026.76s)]
*  It's just like a big something just flew through the trees. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3028.76s)]
*  And then that's when he's kind of, you know. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3031.76s)]
*  And of course, we're like, fuck out of here. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3034.76s)]
*  But it was just too weird. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3037.76s)]
*  And then he was like, yeah, you guys missed your other markers. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3041.76s)]
*  I might know where they are. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3044.76s)]
*  So we just kind of went and got all our markers and went back to the base. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3046.76s)]
*  Because we're out, dude. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3050.76s)]
*  We're out like 20 miles. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3052.76s)]
*  Out there with Bigfoot. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3054.76s)]
*  Well, I wasn't really worried about Bigfoot because according to that dude, Bigfoot don't bother you. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3056.76s)]
*  I was worried about the other animals. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3061.76s)]
*  So that dude seen Bigfoot before? [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3064.76s)]
*  I don't know if he's seen him before, but he just said he don't buy. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3066.76s)]
*  He just lets you know when you've gone too far in the woods. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3070.76s)]
*  Really? [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3073.76s)]

*  I stepped on one of those. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3350.0400000000004s)]
*  I stepped on a fire ant hill on Saturday. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3352.0400000000004s)]
*  Not on Saturday, on Tuesday. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3356.76s)]
*  Those are the. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3358.36s)]
*  On 4th July. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3359.2000000000003s)]
*  Are those the big ones that bite? [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3360.0400000000004s)]
*  No, they're little ones, but they fuck me up. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3360.88s)]
*  Where they get you at? [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3362.84s)]
*  All over my foot. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3363.84s)]
*  Look at my foot look like. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3365.0800000000004s)]
*  All swollen. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3366.1200000000003s)]
*  Fuck man. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3366.96s)]
*  That was just yesterday. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3367.96s)]
*  How's your foot now? [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3370.0400000000004s)]
*  It's fine, now it's normal. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3371.0s)]
*  Oh. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3373.4s)]
*  But I got stung like 15 times. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3374.32s)]
*  My toes look like that anyway. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3377.6s)]
*  Yeah, look at that Jamie. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3379.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3382.1600000000003s)]
*  As a matter of fact, I got the thing in my baby toe. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3385.1600000000003s)]
*  Cause my baby toe tries to leave. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3388.2000000000003s)]
*  So you get the little rubber thing, put it up, [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3390.6800000000003s)]
*  bring it back up there. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3392.7200000000003s)]
*  Like your yoga toes? [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3393.96s)]
*  Yeah, you see my toenails, [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3395.2400000000002s)]
*  you're gonna say thank you for your service. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3397.0s)]
*  He's my fuck. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3398.84s)]
*  It's gone with y'all. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3404.92s)]
*  But they, my toenails got messed up when I was like, [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3406.8s)]
*  that guy's like 12. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3410.6800000000003s)]
*  You remember mini bikes? [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3411.7200000000003s)]
*  And the little, with the little fat wheels? [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3413.52s)]
*  Yep. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3415.6000000000004s)]
*  And I had on sandals. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3416.44s)]
*  Oh Jesus. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3417.88s)]
*  You remember the sandals back in the day [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3418.7200000000003s)]
*  with the tire treads on the bottom? [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3419.56s)]
*  Oh yes. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3421.08s)]
*  And going down the hill, [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3421.92s)]
*  and you know had the little brake with the, [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3422.76s)]
*  it's like a plate that stops on the back wheel. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3424.44s)]
*  I heard something go clang-a-lang-a-lang-a-lang-a-lang. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3428.04s)]
*  My fucker was not slowing down. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3430.68s)]
*  Clang-a-lang-a-lang-a-lang. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3432.92s)]
*  Yeah, and I put my feet down and you know, [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3435.56s)]
*  of course the sandals come out. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3437.72s)]
*  Oh Jesus Christ. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3440.36s)]
*  It's all healed. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3442.16s)]
*  It looks painful right now, but it's good. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3443.0s)]
*  Ooh, how long did it take to heal from that? [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3445.44s)]
*  I don't think they've healed. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3447.8s)]
*  Ooh. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3449.32s)]
*  Yeah, you know. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3450.16s)]
*  It's just, it is what it is now. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3451.44s)]
*  You know T-Rex, you know him? [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3452.52s)]
*  No. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3454.4s)]
*  T-Rex, he tours with Bill Burr. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3455.24s)]
*  He says, so you're going too far with this Woods thing? [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3457.6s)]
*  Cause he said my toenails are wooden. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3461.2s)]
*  Well you have an excuse. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3466.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3467.88s)]
*  You don't realize how helpless you are [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3468.72s)]
*  if you just hurt your big toe with one of your feet. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3470.72s)]
*  You're like, what the fuck? [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3473.32s)]
*  It's hard to move around. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3475.0s)]
*  This right here. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3476.64s)]
*  Your pinky. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3478.0s)]
*  Pinky. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3478.84s)]
*  Yeah, pinky. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3479.68s)]
*  Cause your big toe, cause you turn, [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3480.84s)]
*  that's your signal. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3483.6s)]
*  I don't know, that's how you pivot. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3486.5600000000004s)]
*  And so the big toe and pinky doesn't look like [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3488.32s)]
*  he's that important. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3493.32s)]
*  It's true. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3494.88s)]
*  Your little ring finger and ring finger [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3496.0400000000004s)]
*  can reduce your grip strength by 67% if you lose them. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3498.0800000000004s)]
*  Wow. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3502.1600000000003s)]
*  Well you need to follow me around. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3503.2400000000002s)]
*  Your pinky holds as much as 50% of your hand strength. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3504.84s)]
*  Cause everything. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3508.0800000000004s)]
*  It takes you along with the ring feel. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3508.92s)]
*  It forms the power bottom of your hand [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3509.7400000000002s)]
*  while the thumb, index finger, and middle finger [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3514.48s)]
*  provide dexterity. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3516.88s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3519.7200000000003s)]
*  I don't know if I totally agree with that though. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3520.56s)]
*  But it's right there? [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3524.32s)]
*  Yeah, but I don't know if that's universal. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3526.2000000000003s)]
*  Might be depending on what you do. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3529.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3531.2400000000002s)]
*  Cause if you grip a lot of stuff, [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3532.2400000000002s)]
*  or you carry a lot of stuff, [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3533.56s)]
*  I would imagine it would change. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3535.52s)]
*  Definitely can have compensation [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3537.88s)]
*  cause I fucked up my pinky and my whole hand [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3539.1600000000003s)]
*  was fucked up for a while. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3540.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3542.0s)]
*  My pinky slammed in a car door. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3542.84s)]
*  I told you about that. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3544.2000000000003s)]
*  It was numb forever. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3545.1600000000003s)]
*  It was numb for like a month and a half. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3546.48s)]
*  Yeah, but I still did chin ups. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3549.52s)]
*  I could still do chin ups. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3551.44s)]
*  I just didn't do anything with this pinky. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3552.6400000000003s)]
*  It didn't seem to reduce my strength by that much. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3555.6800000000003s)]
*  Here's a test of six different grip methods. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3558.52s)]
*  One without the middle finger, [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3561.2000000000003s)]
*  one without the ring and little fingers. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3562.36s)]
*  And they were both, that was the lowest. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3563.8s)]
*  Right, but is that also a function of mechanics though? [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3565.4s)]
*  Because if you're removing the middle finger, [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3569.44s)]
*  do you have the same leverage on those other fingers? [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3571.92s)]
*  Cause they're all connected, you know? [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3574.2000000000003s)]
*  And a lot of times things, this just looks thicker. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3576.8s)]
*  You just, everybody else don't realize [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3580.7200000000003s)]
*  how important the pinky is until it gets fucked up. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3582.8s)]
*  Well, that's all also now that I'm thinking about though, [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3586.04s)]
*  maybe it is true because maybe I should be thinking [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3587.92s)]
*  about what muscles of the forearm are pulling down [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3590.1200000000003s)]
*  and maybe these ones are stronger. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3593.6000000000004s)]
*  That's gonna bring up the pinky toe too. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3595.4s)]
*  If you cut off your pinky toe, you lose, [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3597.0800000000004s)]
*  it's not all of your balance, [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3599.0s)]
*  but you're gonna have to figure out how to balance again. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3600.0800000000004s)]
*  Cause it makes up a point of balance for you. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3602.7200000000003s)]
*  Wow. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3604.8s)]
*  Remember the Pope of Greenwich Village? [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3606.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I do. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3609.0800000000004s)]
*  They got my thumbs off, Charlie. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3609.92s)]
*  Charlie. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3612.96s)]
*  They got my thumbs, Charlie. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3615.36s)]
*  That was good acting right there. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3621.36s)]
*  Oh my God, that movie was amazing. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3623.48s)]
*  Yeah, John Jones fucked his big toe up [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3625.5600000000004s)]
*  in a fight with Chael Sonnen. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3628.6000000000004s)]
*  He beat the shit out of Chael Sonnen and then got up [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3630.36s)]
*  and was doing the post-fight interview and looked down [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3633.28s)]
*  and saw that his toe was like flipped upside down. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3636.2400000000002s)]
*  His big toe was. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3639.6s)]
*  Wait, did he faint? [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3641.48s)]
*  No, no, we got him, we sat him down. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3642.4s)]
*  He was like, oh boy. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3644.2400000000002s)]
*  And I continued to interview him. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3645.28s)]
*  Like, hold up, like. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3647.28s)]
*  His toe had flipped around. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3648.32s)]
*  His toe had flipped around because that's how much pressure [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3650.2400000000002s)]
*  he was putting into trying to beat Chael Sonnen up. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3654.48s)]
*  Like, yeah, his toe was fucked up. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3659.92s)]
*  So we got him to sit down. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3664.16s)]
*  You can see, ooh, mama. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3665.72s)]
*  So that dude fucked up his own toe and to this day, [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3668.48s)]
*  and he fucked up his own toe because he was pushing off [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3673.08s)]
*  so hard when he was beating down Chael Sonnen. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3675.48s)]
*  But to this day, he has to fight with that toe taped up. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3678.72s)]
*  To this day. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3681.52s)]
*  Imagine how much he lost from having an injured toe [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3683.0s)]
*  like that and he's still the greatest. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3686.28s)]
*  That shit hurts looking at it. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3688.2s)]
*  Hurts looking at it, yeah. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3689.8799999999997s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3691.64s)]
*  You guys seen this new movie with Woody Harrelson? [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3692.48s)]
*  No, I haven't seen it. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3696.04s)]
*  It's called The Champions. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3696.8799999999997s)]
*  He gets a DUI, so he has to go coach some guys [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3698.12s)]
*  with mental, what'd they say, disabilities? [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3704.16s)]
*  No, not disabilities, challenges. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3710.16s)]
*  That's one of the funniest parts of the movie. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3713.3199999999997s)]
*  Because there's one kid who has soft bones. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3715.2s)]
*  He goes, are we gonna, he said, everybody get on your knees. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3717.48s)]
*  He said, can't, I ain't wearing my knee pads. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3720.8s)]
*  He said, okay, don't worry about it. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3722.12s)]
*  So in the big game, he goes, I think I'm gonna come [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3723.16s)]
*  out of the game because I think I sprained my finger. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3725.52s)]
*  He goes, nah, you're good, you're gonna be okay, [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3727.72s)]
*  I'm telling you. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3729.2s)]
*  He showed me his finger and shit, it looked like his toe. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3730.04s)]
*  Oh, twisted around? [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3734.2400000000002s)]
*  It's like, yeah. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3735.52s)]
*  Can you bring that up, The Champions? [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3738.2s)]
*  That is a funny movie, but it's called The Champions. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3740.4s)]
*  But I saw it on the plane, and it's about a lot of people [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3745.76s)]
*  with challenges, so I'm laughing out loud, [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3750.6s)]
*  and the people look over to see what's so funny, [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3754.96s)]
*  and they go, really, asshole? [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3756.84s)]

*  Because it's one kid in the movie, [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3762.76s)]
*  and he always, he grabs a ball and shoots backwards. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3765.4s)]
*  And then he does the Steph Curry. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3769.12s)]
*  And they say, he's the only one in the league who does that. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3770.72s)]
*  And they go, does he ever make it? [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3777.24s)]
*  He says, no, he don't ever make it, [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3778.64s)]
*  but he's the only one in the league who does it. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3780.12s)]
*  He does this backwards, it goes, like that. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3785.4399999999996s)]

*  It kept doing that. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3954.1200000000003s)]
*  Maybe it's a recurring injury. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3955.8s)]
*  Maybe that's why he was so calm about it. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3957.36s)]
*  Yeah, maybe. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3959.2000000000003s)]
*  But he was worked up, the crowd was cheering, man. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3960.04s)]

*  And he said, like, if anything happens, it just pops out. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3972.0s)]
*  Like anything very, anything abrupt, it just pops out. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3975.28s)]
*  It's gonna like pop it back in. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3978.6s)]
*  But I guess, I forgot about Fear Factor. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3983.4s)]
*  So now, cause you're not, dude, I have run out of the room. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=3986.2s)]

*  Master Lee, he did shows in the park with Charlie. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4378.56s)]

*  Savages. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4406.16s)]
*  I'm gonna read my haikus anyway. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4409.0s)]
*  For those of you who don't know, [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4417.92s)]
*  haiku is Japanese for really short poem. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4420.76s)]
*  Haiku is Japanese for really short poem. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4424.839999999999s)]
*  Now the beauty of haiku is that the original haiku poets [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4433.24s)]
*  could express their deepest emotions. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4437.879999999999s)]
*  Okay, cut ahead to this. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4439.719999999999s)]
*  Let me see the board break part. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4443.44s)]
*  He said, are you ready to see me break the board? [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4446.44s)]
*  Yeah, that was the whole buildup. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4449.12s)]
*  This is the whole buildup too. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4449.96s)]
*  Hey, hey. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4454.44s)]
*  Now I know why they call it kamikaze. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4458.16s)]
*  Hey, whee. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4461.24s)]
*  Woo. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4464.759999999999s)]
*  He looked a little dizzy right there. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4465.599999999999s)]
*  Wow, that's silly. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4470.12s)]
*  That's such an easy thing to do. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4473.639999999999s)]
*  To break a board? [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4475.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's very easy, it's a trick. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4476.0s)]
*  I got hit with a baseball bat. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4478.24s)]
*  That's very different. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4480.36s)]
*  Those boards snap pretty easy. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4482.2s)]
*  It looks impressive because you think of wood, [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4483.92s)]
*  but it's pine and they're thin. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4486.0s)]
*  They break pretty easy. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4489.12s)]
*  Well, I'm sure I wouldn't get the hard one. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4490.6s)]
*  That would be good. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4494.96s)]
*  I can't believe you don't remember him. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4495.96s)]
*  I don't remember him. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4497.64s)]
*  Maybe it's because of that, breaking the board over the head. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4498.52s)]
*  Maybe I blocked it out. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4501.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4502.28s)]
*  Because I used to have to do board breaking demonstrations. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4503.12s)]
*  When we would open up a new school, [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4506.52s)]
*  a new martial arts school, they would send us to a new place. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4508.0s)]
*  Like they had affiliates. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4510.2s)]
*  Were you doing martial arts then? [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4511.36s)]
*  Yeah, when I was a teenager. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4513.08s)]
*  You were in high school when I met you, weren't you? [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4515.72s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4517.84s)]
*  When I met you, I was like 23, I think. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4518.96s)]
*  Grrr! [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4522.72s)]

*  Well, a one in a nine, what school is that? [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4529.2s)]
*  There's some schools. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4531.48s)]
*  It was a college. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4532.44s)]
*  College, right? [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4533.44s)]

*  Def Jam was popping, all these different shows were happening. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4585.72s)]
*  It was like there was an explosion [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4588.76s)]

*  It's like Dave Chappelle was talking. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4640.0s)]
*  He was like, how we do it, how we get over, [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4644.24s)]
*  how we get through it. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4648.08s)]

*  hey man, go sit on the couch and everything. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4663.2s)]

*  And I was, because I was so hurt and broke up. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4671.28s)]
*  But you don't get, it's not like television, [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4675.24s)]
*  you don't get to sit on your own couch. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4677.24s)]
*  It's like a group session, man. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4679.12s)]
*  And it was two young guys in there, man. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4681.36s)]
*  Both of them had like titanium legs and everything. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4683.4s)]
*  And I go, yo, oh man, I saw you on television, man. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4685.88s)]
*  Can we take a picture, man? [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4688.2s)]

*  I was like, I got my thing. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4693.64s)]
*  But even with my, I felt sorry for them. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4696.6s)]
*  Because these guys look like there's like 18, 20. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4700.76s)]
*  I'm like, I'm hurt because of the son I lost. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4703.28s)]
*  And because of what happened to them, [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4708.52s)]
*  they may not even get to have a, you know what I'm saying? [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4710.52s)]

*  not talking about him, but just still getting down. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4719.44s)]
*  Because that's, because it's because of him, [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4723.599999999999s)]
*  I had the nerve to do it in the first place. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4725.599999999999s)]
*  I used to go to comedy clubbing. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4727.04s)]
*  Yeah, I went to a comedy club, my first open mic. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4729.2s)]
*  And this guy, Kevin Lee was juggling [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4732.12s)]
*  and he dropped the bowling ball. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4735.0s)]
*  Like on television, nobody ever drops it. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4736.799999999999s)]
*  He dropped it, boom, and the owner goes, [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4738.32s)]

*  The people are screaming, they think it's part of the show. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4745.6s)]
*  I thought it was part of the show. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4747.88s)]
*  They scream, ah! [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4749.320000000001s)]

*  when I can drink that? [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4955.240000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4956.4800000000005s)]
*  Don't do that. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4957.320000000001s)]
*  Don't do that? [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4958.16s)]
*  It's because I was almost, my bike was in the car, [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4959.0s)]
*  I was driving, and you know, I'm driving, [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4962.200000000001s)]
*  and I'm like, I ain't gonna make it. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4965.04s)]
*  I don't wanna sit in it, but I ain't gonna make it, son. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4968.96s)]
*  I ain't gonna make it. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4972.2s)]
*  So you're like sitting up, you're hunched up [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4973.04s)]
*  while you're driving. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4975.08s)]
*  I got on bike pants, but I got my shorts on [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4976.04s)]
*  over my bike pants. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4978.92s)]
*  Oh boy. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4979.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4980.68s)]
*  It just went, you know, when you just go, daddy. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4982.64s)]
*  Daddy. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4986.0s)]
*  Shit! [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4987.2s)]
*  And it's no use of going, stopping. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4988.64s)]
*  Take this all the way to the crib. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4992.04s)]
*  Yeah, take the L. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4993.36s)]
*  And go to your house and shit in your pants. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4995.080000000001s)]
*  And hope you don't have to get [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4998.080000000001s)]
*  in the elevator with anybody. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=4998.92s)]
*  Just the ad is. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5000.72s)]
*  And my mom was like, it's a cleanse. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5004.68s)]
*  What do you think that means? [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5007.320000000001s)]
*  You know, I didn't think about that. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5009.84s)]
*  Well, it definitely makes you shit a lot. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5011.320000000001s)]
*  But a lot or just, cause it just. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5014.72s)]
*  Well, it's a lot of fiber, you know? [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5017.56s)]
*  And it's a lot of moisture, it's a lot of liquid, [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5019.68s)]
*  a lot of fiber, and just, whee, it's all lubed up. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5021.56s)]
*  Good for you, right? [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5024.52s)]
*  The, I think there's a lot of nutrients in it. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5026.04s)]
*  There's a question about whether or not [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5028.4800000000005s)]
*  you should have that much raw kale, [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5029.92s)]
*  because it's high in oxalates. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5032.200000000001s)]
*  And in certain individuals, they've had issues [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5034.240000000001s)]
*  with oxalates that lead to things like kidney stones. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5036.64s)]
*  That could also be genetic too, I think. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5040.200000000001s)]
*  But the oxalates, I think in high doses, [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5042.4400000000005s)]
*  they think like a lot of raw spinach and a lot of raw. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5045.160000000001s)]
*  It's like a balance, you know? [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5048.080000000001s)]
*  Some of it's good for you, too much of it [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5050.44s)]
*  is probably not so good for you. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5052.759999999999s)]
*  Well, the reason I'm drinking this stuff now [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5054.44s)]
*  is because I went to the doctor like last month. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5059.599999999999s)]
*  And they said my, your PSA, PSA? [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5062.5199999999995s)]
*  Cause both my grandfathers both passed from prostate cancer. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5066.96s)]
*  So he's basically the doctor said you don't, [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5071.28s)]
*  what they're doing, I gotta go back next week [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5074.719999999999s)]
*  for some more results of more tests. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5076.44s)]
*  And so far the options is, I think it's like [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5080.679999999999s)]
*  some Angelina Jolie stuff, like he says, [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5084.36s)]
*  with these levels, if it's not there now, [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5087.48s)]
*  it will be soon, so will it's just, [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5090.28s)]
*  and I just, I never heard anybody removing that. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5093.28s)]
*  So removing your whole prostate, I'm like, [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5098.44s)]
*  so I've been a little stressed out lately. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5101.2s)]
*  Is there other ways that they can mitigate that? [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5103.0s)]
*  That's what I'm trying to figure out. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5105.48s)]
*  I read an article. What else can I do? [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5107.16s)]
*  I read an article about this guy who had very high rates [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5109.0s)]
*  and they wanted him to do something [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5113.44s)]
*  and he decided to try doing a cold plunge every morning. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5115.36s)]
*  And then he went into like a ketogenic diet. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5120.84s)]
*  And apparently he radically lowered his numbers. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5124.8s)]
*  So, and it actually even elevated his testosterone. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5128.8s)]
*  Tell your listeners to help me radically lower my. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5130.8s)]
*  Well, I think that might be a way, but do you have a, [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5134.04s)]
*  a place near you that has a cold plunge? [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5139.96s)]
*  I don't know, but okay. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5141.24s)]
*  Do you have a yard? [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5142.84s)]
*  Yeah. You have a. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5144.12s)]
*  Like an ice bucket? [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5144.96s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you just, you basically need. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5146.56s)]
*  Yeah, you could do it in a tub for sure. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5148.96s)]
*  But if you get one that's outside, [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5151.0s)]
*  that stays cold all the time, that way you, [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5153.08s)]
*  you don't have to fill the tub up [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5156.96s)]
*  and every morning you just get in it. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5158.36s)]
*  You mean like to just, to just sit in it. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5159.68s)]
*  Sit in it in your body, underwater for like three minutes. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5161.72s)]
*  And it'll bring your PSAs down. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5164.88s)]
*  It'll bring, well, with this guy, [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5167.2s)]
*  I mean, I don't know if this is just his case, [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5169.360000000001s)]
*  but what this guy did was twofold. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5170.76s)]
*  He did that every morning. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5172.8s)]
*  And then he also went on a ketogenic diet. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5174.72s)]
*  So he stopped eating sugar. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5177.52s)]
*  He stopped eating anything that is, you know, [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5179.92s)]
*  he is, I think it's like, I don't know what the fat [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5183.72s)]
*  to protein ratio is, but there's like a ratio [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5186.360000000001s)]
*  where your body's just burning off fat. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5190.04s)]
*  And that's what he went into. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5191.96s)]
*  And apparently that's a good diet [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5192.92s)]
*  for people that have cancer too. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5194.62s)]
*  So this guy lowered his rates. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5197.12s)]
*  Now, is that anecdotal? [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5199.16s)]
*  Yes. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5200.32s)]
*  That's it. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5201.16s)]
*  Here it is. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5202.0s)]
*  Howard lowered my PSA with ketosis and ice baths. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5202.84s)]
*  The prostate protocol. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5205.24s)]
*  Okay, so this guy has a Morosco. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5207.16s)]
*  I have one of those at home. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5210.0s)]
*  They're awesome. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5211.219999999999s)]
*  And we have a blue cube here. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5212.08s)]
*  That tub is called a Morosco? [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5213.32s)]
*  Yeah, and we have one here called the blue cube. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5214.44s)]
*  That's awesome too. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5216.88s)]
*  It's actually even more brutal [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5217.719999999999s)]
*  because the water stays on like flowing really fast. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5219.719999999999s)]
*  So an email from Morosco power user [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5223.12s)]
*  asked me about the protocol I used [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5225.16s)]
*  to bring my prostate specific antigen [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5226.44s)]
*  down from 7.0 to 1.8 nanograms per milliliter. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5229.44s)]
*  Says I purchased a Morosco about a year ago, [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5234.76s)]
*  blah, blah, blah. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5236.96s)]
*  Okay, so this is the question. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5239.5199999999995s)]
*  The guy's asking the question and say he has his PSAs. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5241.04s)]
*  No, no, down, right. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5244.639999999999s)]
*  So then the answer. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5246.36s)]
*  The guy explained what he did. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5250.04s)]
*  Is that it? [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5256.16s)]
*  Hold on, go back up right there. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5259.44s)]
*  Right there. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5263.0s)]
*  The prostate protocol. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5263.84s)]
*  The most essential, sensational finding [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5265.04s)]
*  in my blood test results was not so much [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5267.28s)]
*  the improvement in my PSA, [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5269.76s)]
*  but the elevation of my testosterone [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5271.24s)]
*  to levels that were nearly unheard of [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5273.44s)]
*  for an overweight 56 year old man. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5275.599999999999s)]
*  I wrote about it in detail [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5278.04s)]
*  and what happened to my testosterone [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5279.08s)]
*  after using ice baths to treat my prostate. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5280.4s)]
*  I've since updated that article [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5282.92s)]
*  to include more of the science behind how it works [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5285.6s)]
*  and describe what I did that worked for me. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5287.28s)]
*  However, it's possible that not every man [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5290.68s)]
*  is seeking to boost his testosterone. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5293.6s)]
*  For example, my girlfriend who generally seems pleased [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5295.84s)]
*  with the results of my T levels [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5298.36s)]
*  has already mentioned that she'd rather [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5299.72s)]
*  I didn't do anything to push them higher. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5301.4800000000005s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5304.28s)]
*  But more importantly, some men have experienced concern [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5305.16s)]
*  that their doctors suggested higher testosterone levels [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5308.16s)]
*  may lead to increased prostate cancer risk. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5311.12s)]
*  Okay, this is a long article. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5315.24s)]
*  But his protocol was kept his ice bath at 34 degrees, [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5317.5199999999995s)]
*  plunged up to his neck for two to four minutes, [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5321.92s)]
*  an average of six days a week. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5324.24s)]
*  So that gives me 20 minutes of extreme cold exposure [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5326.5199999999995s)]
*  per week, which is enough to activate my brown fat [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5329.08s)]
*  and maintain high glucose sensitivity. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5331.36s)]
*  Then fasting for 24 hours once a week, [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5334.88s)]
*  and then cycling in and out of keto. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5338.48s)]
*  In addition to intermittent fasting, [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5341.360000000001s)]
*  low carb several days a week [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5343.28s)]
*  so I can be sure he reaches ketosis. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5344.76s)]
*  Doesn't stay in ketosis for more than a few days. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5346.64s)]
*  When I'm ready to come out, I'll indulge with fresh bread [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5349.6s)]
*  or a croissant or a favorite dessert or fruit in season. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5352.76s)]
*  Okay, I enjoy good red wine and dark beer, blah, blah, blah. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5356.12s)]
*  All right, so then there's this disclaimer. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5359.96s)]
*  I don't know if the ice bath prostate protocol [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5362.88s)]
*  will work for you. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5365.360000000001s)]
*  Maybe you'll adopt every practice that worked for me [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5366.64s)]
*  only to discover that it does not work for you. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5368.68s)]
*  Everybody is different. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5371.64s)]
*  Nevertheless, if you decide to try it, [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5372.4800000000005s)]
*  will you share your results? [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5373.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5375.76s)]
*  So try it, try that. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5376.76s)]
*  Yeah, let's try it. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5378.88s)]
*  Before they do surgery on you. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5379.72s)]
*  Yeah, I could see it. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5381.360000000001s)]
*  Because he said it like he was taking out my wisdom tooth, [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5382.400000000001s)]
*  dude. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5384.56s)]
*  Yeah, yikes. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5385.400000000001s)]
*  He said, yeah, we could just remove your, [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5386.240000000001s)]
*  come on, hold up motherfucker. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5387.08s)]
*  Yeah, slow down. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5388.72s)]
*  And if this works, I mean, if it worked for that guy, [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5390.2s)]
*  is his level similar to what your level is? [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5392.96s)]
*  Mine was five. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5395.2s)]
*  And what was his? [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5396.64s)]
*  His seven. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5397.4800000000005s)]
*  Oh, so yours is better than his already. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5398.3s)]
*  Yeah, but his is gone. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5400.8s)]
*  Yeah, his went away. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5403.16s)]
*  Yeah, so. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5404.0s)]
*  You might be able to do it. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5404.84s)]
*  You'd have to be real strict with your diet. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5405.679999999999s)]
*  And you know. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5407.719999999999s)]
*  I saw him say candy and syrup-y stuff. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5408.84s)]
*  Well, all that stuff. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5412.88s)]
*  The time you stop eating that stuff, [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5415.12s)]
*  your body has to still recover from when you're eating it. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5417.5599999999995s)]
*  Like all the damage that you've done. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5420.36s)]
*  But it's just not real food. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5422.4s)]
*  And that's most of what people consume. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5423.92s)]
*  And when you start consuming real food. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5425.8s)]
*  Are you vegetarian? [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5427.04s)]
*  No. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5427.88s)]
*  No, me neither. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5428.7s)]
*  I don't think that's the way to go either. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5431.04s)]
*  I don't think that's the way to go for health. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5432.32s)]
*  And I also don't think it's the way to go for conservation [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5434.24s)]
*  and animal management. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5437.04s)]
*  It's like, we live, the reality of the world is, [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5439.16s)]
*  you have millions of cows and millions of chickens. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5442.58s)]
*  The real problem in the world, [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5445.2s)]
*  when it comes to meat is factory farming. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5446.88s)]
*  That's the real problem. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5449.12s)]
*  There's a lot of regenerative farms that raise livestock [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5450.84s)]
*  the way people have for thousands and thousands of years. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5455.36s)]
*  And that's great. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5457.92s)]
*  And you can get food from them. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5458.96s)]
*  Why do we have so many chicken wings? [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5461.12s)]
*  It's a lot of chickens, bro. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5463.88s)]
*  I know, but it's like, nobody's eating that much chicken. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5465.12s)]
*  It's a good question. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5468.5599999999995s)]
*  That's all we got is wings now. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5469.4s)]
*  Just fucking wings. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5471.04s)]
*  No, but think about the breasts. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5471.88s)]
*  Like how many places sell breasts a lot? [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5472.96s)]
*  Like everybody who wants a Caesar salad with chicken breast. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5475.12s)]
*  I'd say all the season's wings. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5477.92s)]
*  Buffalo, wild wings, hot wings. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5479.2s)]
*  Yep. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5481.12s)]
*  Oh true, wild wings. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5481.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5483.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5484.24s)]
*  It's a lot of wings. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5485.08s)]
*  A lot of wings. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5485.9s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of independent wing places. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5486.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5488.32s)]
*  Nothing but fucking wings. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5489.2s)]
*  Like you can't do that. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5490.5199999999995s)]
*  Do you remember that place in the village? [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5491.44s)]
*  They used to have a place in the village? [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5492.96s)]
*  Yes. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5493.8s)]
*  Yeah, right down the street. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5494.639999999999s)]
*  Pluck U. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5495.48s)]

*  Pluck U. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5498.0s)]
*  Bro, they had that death sauce. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5499.72s)]
*  Did you ever have the death sauce? [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5501.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5502.72s)]
*  Whatever they called it, it was like the highest level. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5503.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I just tasted it. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5505.8s)]
*  I never ate that shit, ate that shit. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5507.24s)]
*  It was good though. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5509.2s)]
*  It was delicious. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5510.16s)]

*  What's the place next door to the cellar? [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5520.320000000001s)]
*  The Swarmer place. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5522.64s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5524.6s)]
*  Okay, you know the cellar, the steps are here, [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5525.92s)]
*  the place right there. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5527.52s)]

*  No, I never ate there. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5530.04s)]
*  You ate the pizza place in the corner. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5531.360000000001s)]
*  I didn't do the cellar very many times. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5536.08s)]
*  You did Boston though. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5538.08s)]
*  I did Boston, and I did a lot of shows at Dangerfields. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5539.16s)]
*  Because Dangerfields felt like a road room. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5542.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5544.8s)]
*  Felt like I was on the road. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5545.64s)]
*  Didn't even feel like a New York room. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5547.08s)]
*  I worked there the first time by accident. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5549.48s)]
*  By accident? [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5551.76s)]
*  By accident. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5552.6s)]
*  I came up to New York for the summer to do my reserve duty. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5553.44s)]
*  I'm trying to think what year. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5559.12s)]

*  Yeah, it's 87. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5562.28s)]
*  So you sent a videotape in of your comedy. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=5564.68s)]

*  He just caught me on a, ooh, it was a bad day. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6203.78s)]
*  Because we were almost late for the movie, man, [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6206.26s)]
*  because we stopped at three different ATMs. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6208.0599999999995s)]
*  Because I'm like, well, maybe it's this one. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6210.42s)]
*  Maybe something's wrong with this, [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6212.1s)]
*  because I know I got some money. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6213.74s)]
*  Don't worry about the woods, man, fuck it, [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6217.62s)]
*  I'll just pay you away. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6218.82s)]
*  Guys, pop going too. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6221.26s)]
*  See, comedy is very therapeutic, isn't it? [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6228.7s)]
*  Well, it's definitely the only way, [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6231.7s)]
*  other than time, to take a negative [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6236.0199999999995s)]
*  and turn it into a positive. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6238.0199999999995s)]
*  Comedy can do it pretty quickly. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6240.38s)]
*  It can change your perspective on things pretty quickly. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6243.34s)]
*  I feel better about the bathtub. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6250.62s)]
*  Because that's been hanging heavy on me, man, [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6254.42s)]
*  because that dude said, hey, we'll just remove it. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6257.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6259.7s)]
*  You should probably try this, at the very least. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6262.099999999999s)]
*  I am, and I figured this was a God sin, [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6264.46s)]
*  because all of a sudden, [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6268.34s)]
*  because I'm like, I watch you, and I'm like, [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6270.5s)]
*  Joe seems to know a lot of shit. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6272.94s)]
*  I'm pretty sure he might have an answer [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6274.82s)]
*  that my primary care doctor doesn't have. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6276.86s)]
*  Bam. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6279.54s)]
*  That's ridiculous. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6280.38s)]
*  See? [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6281.5s)]
*  I just got lucky that I read that article. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6283.98s)]
*  That's all it is. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6285.62s)]
*  But I have been doing the cold plunge for months now. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6286.62s)]
*  I guess more than a year. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6292.02s)]
*  You do? [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6293.22s)]
*  For pain? [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6294.06s)]
*  Very regularly, every day for months. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6294.900000000001s)]
*  Is it for pain? [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6296.860000000001s)]
*  No, I do it because it makes me feel really good. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6298.22s)]
*  When I do it, then I get out of it, [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6301.38s)]
*  you get this rush of endorphins that last for hours, [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6303.3s)]
*  and you feel amazing. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6307.26s)]
*  You feel way better. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6309.42s)]
*  Do you know what? [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6310.58s)]
*  Right next to my mother's primary care doctor [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6314.02s)]
*  on Wisconsin Avenue, and it's not DC, [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6316.78s)]
*  but there's a place right next to it. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6321.34s)]
*  And I'm like, see? [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6324.26s)]
*  See? [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6326.82s)]
*  See? [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6327.66s)]
*  I'm gonna tell you something about racialism. [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6328.5s)]
*  Racialism. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6330.58s)]
*  It can be so ignorant. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6331.42s)]
*  Because I saw the people on the picture [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6333.54s)]
*  sitting in tubs of ice, [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6337.3s)]
*  and I said, those Scorpios are crazy as shit. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6340.62s)]
*  And now I'm thinking, boom, maybe that Virgo should sit [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6343.74s)]
*  in that ice too. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6350.74s)]
*  Because I just had that thought of us [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6351.74s)]
*  leaving out of the doctor's office right here, [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6354.18s)]
*  and it's a place. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6356.5s)]
*  And I'm like, who is it? [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6357.58s)]
*  Who is going there? [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6358.58s)]
*  Yeah, what? [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6359.42s)]
*  How do you waste your time? [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6360.26s)]
*  I'm like, what is a cold plunge? [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6361.099999999999s)]
*  Why? [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6361.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6362.76s)]
*  Right. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6363.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but on the picture, it's like, [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6364.42s)]
*  everybody's a Scorpio. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6368.7s)]
*  Well, there's a couple of things [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6370.26s)]
*  that are happening at the same time. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6371.58s)]
*  One of them that's happening is your body [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6373.34s)]
*  is trying to protect itself by rushing all the blood [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6376.74s)]
*  to the center of your body. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6383.42s)]
*  You're fucking freezing in that thing. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6386.179999999999s)]
*  Everything is like, jee. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6388.719999999999s)]
*  And you have a hard time breathing [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6390.82s)]
*  because you can't relax. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6392.719999999999s)]
*  But once you learn how to just accept it, [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6394.26s)]
*  like that guy, and then you just breathe. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6397.98s)]
*  You just breathe. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6399.38s)]
*  And if you do it, for me, it's three minutes. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6400.42s)]
*  I get out after three minutes, and I feel fucking amazing. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6404.22s)]
*  I feel more relaxed, more in tune, more ready to go. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6408.5s)]
*  I talk about it so much, it's getting annoying. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6414.54s)]
*  I should probably stop talking about it. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6416.3s)]
*  It's in Bethesda. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6420.900000000001s)]
*  They have them all over the place. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6422.66s)]
*  But this one is right, and Bethesda's right. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6423.9400000000005s)]
*  Do you know DC Benny? [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6426.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6428.4400000000005s)]
*  It's right in his neighborhood. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6429.280000000001s)]
*  You know DC Benny and what's the other girl? [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6430.12s)]
*  Wendy. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6432.7s)]
*  It's her neighborhood too. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6435.22s)]
*  Well, whoever. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6437.02s)]
*  You should get in one. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6438.58s)]
*  I'm gonna get in one. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6439.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I'd be interested if you followed. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6440.780000000001s)]
*  I'll send you that article. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6442.820000000001s)]
*  I know that one right there. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6445.46s)]
*  And I just remember thinking, see, stupid. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6446.860000000001s)]
*  I tell my kids how ignorant hate is. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6454.06s)]
*  Because you can't hate somebody. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6458.3s)]
*  You gotta love somebody to truly hate them. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6460.9400000000005s)]
*  You just can't hate somebody. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6463.5s)]
*  You gotta know them. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6464.94s)]
*  You can't just say, I fucking hate all steel pitchers. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6466.5s)]
*  You never met a steel pitcher. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6469.54s)]
*  So you can hate, I try to tell them that when they were kids, [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6471.9s)]
*  you can hate your wife because you know her. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6475.9s)]
*  That woman across the street with the orange dress, [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6485.22s)]
*  you can't say, I fucking hate that lady [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6487.02s)]
*  with the orange dress. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6488.54s)]
*  She don't know her. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6489.58s)]
*  But that right there, [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6490.58s)]
*  boom. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6493.46s)]
*  I did a bit about, I was in Australia and I was in a tent. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6498.94s)]
*  Another animal story, I'm sorry. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6502.82s)]
*  I was in a tent and these people rushed by me [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6504.7s)]
*  because the music was stop playing. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6507.18s)]
*  Ding-a-ling-a-ling, ding-a-ling, ding-a-ling, ding-a-ling. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6508.34s)]
*  Like that. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6510.46s)]
*  And they were running, like maybe 10 people, [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6511.3s)]
*  like a small group. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6513.74s)]
*  They weren't together, but they were running. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6514.86s)]
*  And I'm like, fuck, you're not gonna miss [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6516.66s)]
*  that much of the thing. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6518.38s)]
*  And they go by me, because the hallway is round, [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6520.18s)]
*  because the tent is round. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6525.42s)]
*  And as soon as I turn around, there's a tiger. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6526.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah, a real tiger. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6530.34s)]
*  His face is like this big. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6531.820000000001s)]
*  He's right there, he has the saddest little look [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6533.820000000001s)]
*  on his face. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6537.06s)]
*  And then I always say, because this is what happened, [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6537.900000000001s)]
*  like four or five guys who sound like they've been eating [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6540.06s)]
*  peanut butter and jelly sandwiches with no jelly. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6542.14s)]
*  They were like, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6545.54s)]
*  because they were Filipino. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6548.3s)]
*  But I'm not being racialist, that's descriptive. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6549.860000000001s)]
*  They mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6552.860000000001s)]
*  and they were popping him with some little thing, [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6554.860000000001s)]
*  and they pulled him, and they kind of pulled him away. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6556.66s)]
*  But he was just wandering. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6559.5s)]
*  And when he wandered, those people ran. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6561.9400000000005s)]
*  They drugged him. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6564.16s)]
*  I don't know what happened. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6565.66s)]
*  They drugged him. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6566.78s)]
*  Because he was very docile. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6567.62s)]
*  I went to a tiger park in Thailand, [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6568.58s)]
*  and it's weird, because when they're young, [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6572.02s)]
*  there's a lot of supervisors in the room, [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6574.78s)]
*  and there's people that make, [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6577.02s)]
*  because the young ones are fast and playful, [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6579.22s)]
*  and then when they get a little bit older, [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6582.14s)]
*  someone always has to separate you from the cats. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6584.4400000000005s)]
*  But then when it gets to the big ones, [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6587.660000000001s)]
*  those big ones just lay there, dude, like this. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6589.9400000000005s)]
*  His head was no not this big. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6592.620000000001s)]
*  Oh, they're huge, and people sit next to them [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6595.660000000001s)]
*  and take selfies. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6597.580000000001s)]
*  So you have drugged up tigers in a cage, [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6598.72s)]
*  and people sit next to them, [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6601.72s)]
*  and that's the thing that people do. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6603.320000000001s)]
*  So the point I was making about how silly race is [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6606.54s)]
*  and how stupid it is, [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6609.5s)]
*  because when they almost knocked me down, [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6611.28s)]
*  I got, not popcorn, but actual corn on the cob [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6614.099999999999s)]
*  that I bought from the vendor, [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6617.0199999999995s)]
*  almost knocked me down. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6618.74s)]
*  And I was angry, because they ran by me, [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6619.86s)]
*  almost knocked me down. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6624.219999999999s)]
*  And I was, well, on stage, I say, fucking Australians, [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6625.34s)]
*  but that's not what I say right then, under my breath. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6629.76s)]
*  I didn't say that loud, but then I turn around, boom. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6632.48s)]
*  And it's not that they were white or Australian, [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6636.5s)]
*  it's a goddamn tiger was coming. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6638.14s)]
*  I don't know how that explains itself, [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6641.86s)]
*  but you know what I mean. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6643.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6645.2s)]
*  Because at first, I was just saying, [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6646.42s)]
*  said something bad about them, [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6649.54s)]
*  because they almost knocked my soda down and my popcorn. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6650.74s)]
*  But it could have been a group of black people, [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6654.66s)]
*  which I know would have, I'd knock down, [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6657.46s)]
*  because they would have been running faster. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6659.22s)]
*  And then, they'd been screaming too. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6661.26s)]
*  They were the quietest group. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6667.66s)]
*  Like, if there was a tiger behind you, [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6671.26s)]
*  you say, ah, you say something. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6673.9800000000005s)]
*  They just, they just fucking ran. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6676.58s)]
*  Everybody looked nervous, but they just ran. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6680.900000000001s)]
*  And I think somebody could have said, [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6684.7s)]
*  run dude, a tiger's coming. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6686.5s)]
*  Nobody said shit. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6689.58s)]
*  They just ran. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6693.86s)]
*  They just ran past me. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6694.9s)]
*  Nobody, if I was running, and you were coming this way, [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6697.14s)]
*  I would go, dude, here comes a tiger. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6700.34s)]
*  Like that, I wouldn't. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6702.82s)]
*  I wouldn't just go, better you than me, motherfucker. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6704.14s)]
*  That's gotta be one of the most terrifying ways to die. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6708.58s)]
*  There's probably nothing like it. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6712.06s)]
*  Unless you're a rat and it's an eagle or something. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6714.1s)]
*  Right, that's probably just. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6716.42s)]
*  But it would be about the same, wouldn't it? [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6718.42s)]
*  Because his big ass hands would just go. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6719.9s)]
*  Yeah, they would just tear you apart. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6722.46s)]
*  But I'm just thinking for us, it'd be one of the scariest. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6724.46s)]
*  Yeah, because our brain is not gonna, [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6728.18s)]
*  you're gonna feel him, you're gonna hear him crunch your leg. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6732.02s)]
*  Oh God. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6735.3s)]
*  Yeah, and. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6736.34s)]
*  He's gonna kill you first of all. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6738.46s)]
*  And have you ever noticed, like a lot of animals, [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6740.06s)]
*  like you were talking about how the monkeys ate, [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6741.9400000000005s)]
*  how the chimps ate the monkeys? [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6743.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6744.86s)]
*  I think the butt is soft and. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6746.139999999999s)]
*  That's like the. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6749.62s)]
*  Yeah. The guts. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6750.46s)]
*  The gad. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6751.379999999999s)]
*  So they're not gonna bite your head. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6752.419999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6754.9s)]
*  They're gonna start. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6755.74s)]
*  The head'll bite back. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6756.58s)]
*  Yeah, they're gonna bite your butt out. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6757.7s)]
*  It's a horrible video. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6760.58s)]
*  No genitalia. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6762.299999999999s)]
*  He's literally screaming. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6763.139999999999s)]
*  That's my dick, man. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6765.0599999999995s)]
*  Ah! [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6766.46s)]
*  Ah! [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6767.299999999999s)]
*  Imagine if there were things as big as chimps that ate us. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6771.7s)]
*  You have to be real careful when you go outside. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6776.66s)]
*  Hippopotamus. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6777.94s)]
*  Because nature does have this very strange balance. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6779.179999999999s)]
*  Like I watch a lot of videos on praying mantises. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6782.34s)]
*  I'm obsessed with praying mantises. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6785.46s)]
*  It's such a fascinating insect. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6787.259999999999s)]
*  What do they do? [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6788.98s)]
*  They kill hummingbirds, they kill like small rodents, [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6790.0599999999995s)]
*  they kill all kinds of shit. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6796.58s)]
*  Anything that comes near them. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6797.7s)]
*  A prey is only that big. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6799.38s)]
*  I know, dude. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6800.54s)]
*  They kill hummingbirds. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6801.5s)]
*  They hang around bird feeders [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6803.179999999999s)]
*  and they snatch hummingbirds out of the air. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6804.82s)]
*  You never seen this? [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6807.299999999999s)]
*  Never seen that. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6808.139999999999s)]
*  Dude, praying mantises are fascinating. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6808.98s)]
*  I never heard they could do that. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6812.0599999999995s)]
*  So the video that I watched was these ants [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6813.9s)]
*  killing a praying mantis. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6816.74s)]
*  The praying mantis was trying to kill the ants [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6818.62s)]
*  but the ants swarmed on top of him [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6820.82s)]
*  and then systematically cut off his head. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6823.98s)]
*  Ah, shit. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6827.0599999999995s)]
*  It was wild. Teamwork makes it true. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6827.9s)]
*  Teamwork makes it true. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6829.42s)]
*  Teamwork? [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6830.62s)]
*  Yeah, Jamie's gotta find praying mantis gets hummingbird. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6831.46s)]
*  But then, who was that? [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6839.26s)]
*  Woody Allen's movie? [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6841.34s)]
*  When Christopher Walken was the praying mantis? [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6843.02s)]
*  I don't remember that. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6847.42s)]
*  So check this out. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6848.58s)]
*  There's a praying mantis, right? [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6849.42s)]
*  Here comes the bird. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6850.46s)]
*  Watch this though, it's wild. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6855.5s)]
*  It seems to know not to get too close to it. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6857.06s)]
*  Mama! [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6860.06s)]
*  Look at that, bam, got you. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6860.900000000001s)]
*  It got him, didn't it? [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6862.42s)]
*  Isn't that insane? [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6864.14s)]
*  I mean, look at that fucking power that insect has. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6865.9800000000005s)]
*  How is he that much stronger than? [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6869.780000000001s)]
*  It's because he's the person who was, [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6872.1s)]
*  they didn't want it to keep happening, [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6875.9800000000005s)]
*  which is rude, because that bird's dead [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6878.34s)]
*  now that you just fucked up the praying mantis. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6881.780000000001s)]
*  Oh, he didn't want one thing to happen to him. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6883.1s)]
*  Now that you just fucked up the praying mantis. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6885.099999999999s)]
*  What? [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=6887.299999999999s)]

*  but these ants just chopped the shit out of this dude. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7212.38s)]
*  Look how many of them are coming out of the hole too. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7215.74s)]
*  Just coming out ready to go to war. [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7218.9800000000005s)]
*  How do they communicate? [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7224.860000000001s)]
*  I mean, that's what I wanna know. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7226.9400000000005s)]
*  How do they organize? [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7228.5s)]
*  How do they know? [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7229.78s)]
*  Like this is why, look, [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7232.3s)]
*  they just cut his fucking head off. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7233.900000000001s)]
*  Sorry bitch. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7235.38s)]
*  I mean, what? [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7239.820000000001s)]
*  How amazing is this? [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7242.26s)]
*  Just watching this is fucking insane. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7243.900000000001s)]
*  And it's crowded. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7248.22s)]
*  If we went to another planet and we saw things like this, [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7249.66s)]
*  but they were big, like German Shepherd size, [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7252.820000000001s)]
*  we're observing that, people would be utterly fascinated. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7256.06s)]
*  Look how many of them there are together [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7259.78s)]
*  in this little canal, [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7262.62s)]
*  somehow they're communicating together. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7263.62s)]
*  And they wear armor. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7265.099999999999s)]
*  We just accept it because they're little [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7266.9s)]
*  because it's really, really little. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7269.82s)]
*  We're not amazed by it. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7271.5s)]
*  We're only amazed by things that are [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7274.54s)]
*  I wonder what's little to them. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7277.179999999999s)]
*  A certain size. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7278.0199999999995s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7279.5s)]
*  Like an ant is this big. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7280.34s)]
*  I wonder what does an ant go? [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7281.179999999999s)]
*  Get outta here. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7282.94s)]
*  Probably fungus. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7284.179999999999s)]
*  Get outta here. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7286.259999999999s)]
*  Well, definitely fungus actually, [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7287.099999999999s)]
*  because have you ever seen what happens [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7288.38s)]
*  with the cordyceps mushroom in ants? [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7290.34s)]
*  Cordyceps mushroom can infect ants [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7295.14s)]
*  and it makes them grow spores out of their body. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7297.66s)]
*  So mushroom spores and then the spores explode [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7302.14s)]
*  infecting the whole colony. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7305.82s)]
*  Yeah, so these ants know when an ant's been infected [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7308.62s)]
*  and they know that it's gonna explode. [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7313.900000000001s)]
*  So they have to drag it out. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7316.22s)]
*  So they're dragging it out. [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7319.18s)]
*  It's a time release bomb and they're hoping [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7320.02s)]
*  they get outside of their village before it blows up [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7322.46s)]
*  because if it doesn't, all the other people [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7326.14s)]
*  see it growing out of his head. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7327.900000000001s)]
*  That is the cordyceps mushroom has infected this ant [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7331.74s)]
*  and now it's using its body to grow. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7335.82s)]
*  It's the premise behind that zombie show on HBO, [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7338.54s)]
*  The Last of Us. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7343.18s)]
*  The premise is that this infects people. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7344.62s)]
*  Because this fungus, when it pops, [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7348.62s)]
*  it blows all these spores in the air [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7354.34s)]
*  and when it blows all these spores in the air, then. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7357.02s)]
*  It's chemical warfare. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7358.86s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7359.7s)]
*  It's just trying to infect all the, [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7360.62s)]
*  I mean imagine if you found a family member [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7363.14s)]
*  lying there with a giant spore growing out of its back, [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7366.9400000000005s)]
*  a bit of giant sack of spores, [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7371.62s)]
*  just whatever it is for a mushroom [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7373.34s)]
*  and it's just ready to spray. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7374.78s)]
*  Gotta get him out the house. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7376.54s)]
*  Yeah, fuck. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7378.46s)]
*  We gonna miss you, dog. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7379.299999999999s)]
*  And you just got a greasy bandana [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7380.86s)]
*  tied around your head, hoping they don't get you [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7383.9s)]
*  and where you're dragging this body out of town. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7387.299999999999s)]
*  Well, just, so I guess the way that thing, [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7389.5s)]
*  it just, like it's like somebody swallowed a bomb [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7392.78s)]
*  for this, with that fungus. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7397.94s)]
*  Yeah, it's like somebody swallowed a bomb. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7399.94s)]
*  Especially if it's in like a crowded area. [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7401.98s)]
*  Like if that happened and people like burst, [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7404.58s)]
*  people got infected by quarter subs mushrooms [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7408.7s)]
*  in like a subway and burst out into the subway [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7410.0599999999995s)]
*  and coughed and sprayed. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7413.58s)]
*  All those people would be infected. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7415.139999999999s)]
*  Question. [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7416.82s)]
*  With all the mantis crazy videos you've seen [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7417.82s)]
*  and that ant is being controlled [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7420.34s)]
*  by that quarter subs mushroom, which not a parasite, [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7422.5s)]
*  but many mantises are controlled [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7425.139999999999s)]
*  by this horsehair parasite. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7427.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I've heard about this. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7429.0199999999995s)]
*  What if that's creating that crazy behavior that you do? [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7430.74s)]
*  Yes, maybe. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7432.74s)]
*  This is what's crazy. [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7434.0199999999995s)]
*  When you put the mantises in water, [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7434.9s)]
*  that black snake comes out of its asshole. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7436.62s)]
*  That is crazy. [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7438.82s)]
*  There's so many pairs of it. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7439.66s)]
*  You're not nuts. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7441.46s)]
*  So that thing lives in its body. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7445.34s)]
*  But it can't get in the water. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7447.58s)]
*  It hates the water. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7450.0199999999995s)]
*  It hates the water. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7450.98s)]
*  Look how big it is. [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7452.18s)]
*  I mean, how wild is that? [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7454.099999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7455.42s)]
*  That's probably why he's so strong. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7456.46s)]
*  He's like, [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7458.42s)]
*  It's possessed. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7459.86s)]
*  What's the name? [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7460.7s)]
*  Venom. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7461.54s)]
*  Yeah, venom. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7462.38s)]
*  It is venom. [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7463.22s)]
*  It is venom. [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7464.22s)]
*  It's venom. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7465.34s)]
*  Oh my God, it's a real life venom. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7466.700000000001s)]
*  And he's the praying mantis that's going, [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7468.66s)]
*  I'ma die. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7470.3s)]
*  You're not gonna die. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7471.14s)]
*  It's a real life venom. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7472.9400000000005s)]
*  Wow, that is crazy. [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7474.46s)]
*  That's nuts. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7476.42s)]
*  Look at it. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7477.9800000000005s)]
*  It's just like an evil snake that lives in its body. [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7478.820000000001s)]
*  And look how, yeah. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7482.54s)]
*  It even looks sinister. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7484.900000000001s)]
*  It looks alien. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7487.14s)]
*  Like just thinking that something like that would live [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7488.9800000000005s)]
*  in something that size. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7491.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and he's not letting them out, is he? [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7492.9400000000005s)]
*  I think it's out now. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7496.54s)]
*  It's out of his body, but it's still attached to his butt. [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7497.38s)]
*  Is it trying to climb back in? [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7501.38s)]
*  Yeah, but just amazing. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7502.86s)]
*  Oh my God, is it trying to climb back in? [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7503.98s)]
*  Is that what's really going on here? [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7505.42s)]
*  It's trying to climb back up his butt. [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7507.7s)]
*  And then he's trying to eat it. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7510.259999999999s)]
*  He's like, fuck you, you've been inside of me. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7511.5s)]
*  I'm gonna put you inside the other way. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7513.219999999999s)]
*  So he doesn't even know if he did that, [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7514.62s)]
*  it would probably just make more of those in its gut. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7515.94s)]
*  Is that just regular water or they got something in it? [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7518.7s)]
*  That's a good question. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7521.179999999999s)]
*  I think it's just water. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7522.0199999999995s)]
*  I wonder if you eat it, if that thing grows in your gut. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7523.22s)]
*  Oh man. [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7528.46s)]
*  That's how the cycle is created. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7529.54s)]
*  Yeah, because it seems like he wants to eat it. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7531.26s)]
*  Maybe he wants to be venom again. [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7533.66s)]
*  Maybe once he gets out, he'll become a bitch. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7535.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7537.62s)]
*  He's like, I don't even, hummingbirds are cool. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7538.54s)]
*  I don't wanna kill hummingbirds. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7542.5s)]
*  I just eat dead bugs I find laying around. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7544.42s)]
*  He was sick and just a man, he said, [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7546.58s)]
*  and his buddies go, I killed a bird, I did this. [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7548.46s)]
*  He's like, fuck it, outta here. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7551.06s)]
*  He was venom. [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7553.38s)]
*  Yeah, so is that a large percentage of mantises [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7554.9s)]
*  are infected by that? [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7559.34s)]
*  I had heard that. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7560.3s)]
*  This other article about it says that [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7562.3s)]
*  the parasite is what forces them to go into water. [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7564.74s)]
*  Oh, to get the fuck out, to get him out of here. [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7569.74s)]
*  Oh, so the parasite forces them to go into water [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7572.58s)]
*  so it can hatch? [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7574.94s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7576.3s)]
*  Well, that was the case with grasshoppers, right? [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7578.46s)]
*  With grasshoppers, we talked about that before. [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7581.26s)]
*  It was that there's this parasite that, [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7583.5s)]
*  it's some sort of a worm, aquatic worm, [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7586.06s)]
*  and it grows inside the grasshopper's body [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7590.1s)]
*  and then convinces the grasshopper to commit suicide [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7592.900000000001s)]
*  so it can be born. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7596.9400000000005s)]
*  So it talks the, it just takes over the grasshopper's brain. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7598.820000000001s)]
*  Like, get in that water, bitch. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7601.5s)]
*  Da da da da. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7602.7s)]
*  And it comes out of the grasshopper's body. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7605.46s)]
*  Yeah, so it's piloting the grasshopper. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7608.7s)]
*  Can this thing be the grasshopper? [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7612.06s)]
*  Could it be the grasshopper? [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7614.06s)]
*  A praying mantis, can he be the grasshopper? [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7615.46s)]
*  Oh yeah, praying mantis will fuck up a grasshopper. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7619.26s)]
*  Oh, so they were better. [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7622.18s)]
*  I think they, I bet a lot of the insects [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7623.46s)]
*  have parasites inside of them. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7625.9800000000005s)]
*  I bet it's probably pretty common. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7627.9800000000005s)]
*  It's an interesting relationship. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7629.700000000001s)]
*  Like, what's his name? [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7631.38s)]
*  The little guy with the, Napoleon. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7632.62s)]
*  He had a parasite? [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7635.900000000001s)]
*  He had syphilis or something. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7637.3s)]
*  Oh yeah, that's VD. [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7638.660000000001s)]
*  But a lot of people have toxoplasmosis. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7641.9800000000005s)]
*  Toxoplasmosis, I think it's called toxoplasmosis gondii. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7646.62s)]
*  It's a parasite that is from cats. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7650.26s)]
*  So the way cats get it is they get it from rats [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7655.34s)]
*  and when rats get it, rats, for whatever reason, [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7659.660000000001s)]
*  when they get this parasite, their testes swell up, [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7663.820000000001s)]
*  they get hard ons and they get sexually aroused [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7668.9s)]
*  at the smell of cat urine. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7671.46s)]
*  So it tricks their body into thinking that cat urine, [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7673.66s)]
*  it's like, it tricks their, [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7676.78s)]
*  hijacks their sexual reward system [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7678.219999999999s)]
*  to seek out cat urine. [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7680.54s)]
*  So they're going after cat urine [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7682.38s)]
*  and it erases their fear of cats. [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7683.54s)]
*  So what it's doing is encouraging them [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7686.0599999999995s)]
*  to get killed by cats. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7688.34s)]
*  So the cats eat them and the only way [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7689.82s)]
*  this toxoplasmosis reproduces is inside the guts of a cat. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7692.259999999999s)]
*  And then the cats shit it out [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7697.26s)]
*  and that's why they tell pregnant women [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7699.46s)]
*  to never handle cat litter. [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7701.18s)]
*  Because you could handle cat litter and get toxo [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7703.02s)]
*  and it could be very bad for you and the baby. [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7705.34s)]
*  Napoleon's retreating army felled by parasites. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7708.5s)]
*  Boom. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7711.740000000001s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7712.58s)]
*  This podcast is like the Lion King, man. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7714.02s)]
*  It's like the circle of life. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7717.860000000001s)]
*  Ever since his catastrophic retreat from Moscow, [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7720.900000000001s)]
*  the terrible losses suffered by Napoleon's soldiers [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7723.7s)]
*  have been blamed on hunger [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7726.06s)]
*  and the biting cold of the Russian winter. [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7727.38s)]
*  But according to new research by French scientists, [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7729.54s)]
*  the fabled Grand ArmÃ©e reduced to 30,000 men [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7732.14s)]
*  by December of 1812 from a total of 600,000 to 700,000 [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7736.5s)]
*  just six months earlier was actually felled by parasites. [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7741.54s)]
*  Researchers led by Deiter Raoult [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7745.46s)]
*  of the National Science Research Center in Marseille. [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7748.3s)]
*  How do you say that? [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7751.5s)]
*  Marseille? [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7752.38s)]
*  Marseille. [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7753.22s)]
*  Marseille? [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7754.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7754.900000000001s)]
*  They analyzed the DNA of 72 teeth extracted [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7755.74s)]
*  from 35 skeletons removed from a mass military grave [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7757.78s)]
*  near Villeneuse in present day Lithuania in 1995. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7761.66s)]
*  They found minute traces of microbes [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7767.179999999999s)]
*  associated with typhus and trench fever. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7769.3s)]
*  A deadly disease is transmitted by fleas and lice [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7772.38s)]
*  in the dental matter of 10 neopolic soldiers. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7775.74s)]
*  The newspaper Le Figaro reported yesterday. [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7779.46s)]
*  What, they had to all get it [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7785.1s)]
*  because it's cold, they're fighting in the winter. [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7786.82s)]
*  So they gotta be huddled up. [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7789.26s)]
*  So yeah, so everybody yuck it, yuck, yuck. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7790.9800000000005s)]
*  So typhus, interesting. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7793.54s)]
*  691,000. [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7796.26s)]
*  So at one point there was 691,000, [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7798.1s)]
*  it got down to 30,000, it was all from parasites? [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7802.18s)]
*  Most of it, it's the cold and the hunger did most of it, [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7806.02s)]
*  but great tolls definitely from disease. [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7808.34s)]
*  Wow. [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7811.18s)]
*  And if you're cold and hungry, you're bottled up together. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7812.42s)]
*  We're talking about 600,000 people [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7815.46s)]
*  dying from either being cold or fleas. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7818.58s)]
*  Six months. [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7822.46s)]
*  Holy shit. [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7823.82s)]
*  It's like 3,000 a day. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7825.9400000000005s)]
*  Lems were falling off. [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7826.9400000000005s)]
*  It was nasty, they looked just like that ant. [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7828.42s)]
*  And then the sanitary conditions, [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7832.22s)]
*  when you have that many bodies, [[02:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7834.02s)]
*  like where are you putting these bodies? [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7835.9800000000005s)]
*  They're gonna all rot. [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7838.06s)]
*  Who's gonna be around, who's healthy enough [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7839.62s)]
*  to move these bodies around? [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7841.5s)]
*  And just imagine you build a house on that land. [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7843.18s)]
*  Oh, Jesus. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7847.14s)]
*  Where are the wolves there too? [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7847.98s)]
*  You dig up the wolves. [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7848.94s)]
*  That's my absolute favorite story of World War I. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7852.9s)]
*  What? [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7857.14s)]
*  World War I they had to have a ceasefire [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7858.1s)]
*  between the Germans and the Russians [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7859.82s)]
*  because there were so many of them getting killed by wolves. [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7861.18s)]
*  Damn. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7863.74s)]
*  So they said let's stop killing each other [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7864.58s)]
*  and kill these fucking wolves. [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7866.46s)]
*  And so they killed the wolves [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7868.26s)]
*  and then went back to killing each other. [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7869.46s)]
*  As you should. [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7871.54s)]
*  But I'm sure the wolves are like, [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7874.5s)]
*  these guys are here fucking up. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7875.86s)]
*  Well, what would happen is [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7877.379999999999s)]
*  they were fighting trench warfare. [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7878.74s)]
*  So someone would get shot and they would be screaming [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7880.179999999999s)]
*  and maybe they'd be way the fuck over there. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7884.0599999999995s)]
*  And it's nighttime and these wolves get in those trenches [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7886.58s)]
*  and they smell blood and they'll pull that motherfucker [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7889.66s)]
*  out of the trench. [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7892.179999999999s)]
*  So people were screaming, [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7893.219999999999s)]
*  screaming while they're getting eaten alive by wolves. [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7895.0599999999995s)]
*  So you're sitting there huddled with your rifle [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7897.339999999999s)]
*  and you can't jump up because the Germans will shoot you [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7899.62s)]
*  or the Russians will shoot you. [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7902.42s)]
*  And then. [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7904.62s)]
*  Just one or two, the wolves are there. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7905.46s)]
*  And so they had to have conversations. [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7906.7s)]
*  They were sending scouts out and they would disappear [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7909.26s)]
*  and then they'd go find a boot [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7913.74s)]
*  and they're torn apart, bloody clothing. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7915.9s)]
*  And they realized these people were getting swarmed by wolves. [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7918.26s)]
*  There were so many wolves up there [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7921.18s)]
*  that the wolves had taken to hunting people [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7922.54s)]
*  because they'd eaten so many soldiers. [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7926.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, so it becomes a primary food source. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7929.06s)]
*  Like dead human beings left on the battlefield [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7931.860000000001s)]
*  in World War I were a primary food source [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7935.46s)]
*  to the wolves in that area. [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7938.14s)]
*  And man, just like the lions again, because it's easier. [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7940.54s)]
*  Much easier. [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7945.3s)]
*  Yeah, but easier than taking down a deer. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7946.14s)]
*  You know how many people have to get killed by wolves [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7947.9400000000005s)]
*  before you decide to have a fucking meeting [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7949.34s)]
*  with your fellow humans that you were just killing [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7953.1s)]
*  six months ago? [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7955.38s)]
*  We gotta do something. [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7957.1s)]
*  We're losing too many guys to wolves. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7958.54s)]
*  This is crazy. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7960.1s)]
*  We gotta admit, we hate each other, [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7961.18s)]
*  but we hate wolves more. [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7962.7s)]
*  Wolves used to be terrifying. [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7967.9400000000005s)]
*  That's what Little Red Riding Hood was all about. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7970.3s)]
*  That was what the three little pigs were all about. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7972.82s)]
*  Like they were fucking terrifying. [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7975.5s)]
*  And somewhere along the line, [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7978.02s)]
*  people forgot to be scared of them [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7979.42s)]
*  when they killed them all off in the West. [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7981.18s)]
*  So they're like, let's bring them back. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7983.46s)]
*  We miss the wolves. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7985.86s)]
*  Let's bring them back. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7987.259999999999s)]
*  Are you fucking sure? [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7989.179999999999s)]
*  The wolf was probably one of the first members [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7990.58s)]
*  of the LBGSTMJ. [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7993.219999999999s)]
*  Because remember, he just went in there [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7996.259999999999s)]
*  and put on that dress, man. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=7998.54s)]
*  Remember he had the dress on? [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8001.259999999999s)]
*  And she came in and she goes. [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8002.58s)]
*  That's right. [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8003.42s)]
*  Yeah, she said, hey, what you doing? [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8004.259999999999s)]
*  Because she knew it was him, but she's like, [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8005.94s)]
*  what big eyes you have. [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8009.259999999999s)]
*  She's trying to back out. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8010.66s)]
*  She's like, because she knows she can't run from him. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8011.66s)]
*  She gotta back up, she gotta be slick with it. [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8013.66s)]
*  She's caught him with ladies clothes on. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8016.66s)]
*  Do you know there's a cartoon of that [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8019.46s)]
*  from like 1930 something. [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8024.66s)]
*  And instead of a wolf, it's a Jew. [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8029.9s)]
*  It's like a really stereotypical image of a Jewish person. [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8034.46s)]
*  And it's a weird cartoon, man, [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8040.3s)]
*  because they changed it later on [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8043.62s)]
*  and they changed it into a wolf. [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8045.9s)]
*  Make sure this is true, because with AI today, [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8048.3s)]
*  you never know when you're getting fooled by something. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8051.0599999999995s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8061.94s)]

*  Knockin' at the door dressed like a wolf? [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8079.46s)]
*  Yeah, it was the wolf that took the refrain. [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8083.1s)]
*  A wolf wearing women's clothes, right? [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8084.3s)]

*  And now he's just, he's got a fucking Salsa machine [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8231.54s)]
*  in the kitchen. [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8234.300000000001s)]
*  And he goes, you're doing really well for yourself there. [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8236.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8240.14s)]
*  So you just gotta see it. [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8240.98s)]
*  It's just a sign of the times. [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8241.98s)]
*  A guy who was an all right guy back there, [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8243.539999999999s)]
*  he's a piece of shit now. [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8246.22s)]
*  Because the things he said and the views [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8247.66s)]
*  that this great-great-great grandpa, [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8250.22s)]
*  he says, you can't say that now. [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8252.1s)]
*  Right, just watching old movies. [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8255.02s)]
*  They used to beat women up in old movies all the time. [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8257.06s)]
*  They always smack, look. [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8258.98s)]
*  Smack. [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8260.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8261.22s)]
*  They'd smack women all the time back then. [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8264.94s)]
*  Just that alone. [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8267.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8269.539999999999s)]
*  But I just saw a movie with Sammy Davis Jr. [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8272.82s)]
*  It's an old movie with Sammy Davis Jr. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8276.66s)]
*  I think he's making fun of Miles Davis, I don't know. [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8278.86s)]
*  But he's a really good trumpet player, [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8281.38s)]
*  but he's an asshole. [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8284.3s)]
*  And he's playing this new kind of jazz or whatever. [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8285.58s)]
*  And Cicely Tyson is in it. [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8289.18s)]
*  She's his girlfriend. [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8292.38s)]
*  The girl who played Wallona on Good Times. [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8294.06s)]
*  The one who sings, [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8299.02s)]
*  ain't we lucky we got him. [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8300.02s)]
*  She's in it. [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8302.460000000001s)]
*  And her and Cicely Tyson get into an argument or whatever. [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8303.380000000001s)]
*  And then Sammy Davis Jr. just comes up and boom! [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8308.02s)]
*  Punches her in the face. [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8311.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8313.02s)]
*  Yeah, Wallona from Good Times. [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8314.220000000001s)]
*  She punched her right in the damn face. [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8315.66s)]
*  Wow. [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8317.54s)]
*  He used all real jazz musicians. [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8319.94s)]
*  Did you ever watch Good Times? [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8323.74s)]
*  Yes. [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8325.460000000001s)]
*  Remember the Janitor? [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8326.300000000001s)]
*  Yes. Bookman? [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8327.220000000001s)]
*  I never knew he was a famous jazz musician. [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8328.06s)]
*  He was in it too. [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8330.82s)]
*  He was in the movie too. [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8331.779999999999s)]
*  It's called. [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8333.539999999999s)]
*  I don't know the name of it, but Sammy Davis Jr. [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8334.5s)]
*  It's got a lot of, Morgan Freeman is in it, [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8336.74s)]
*  but he don't have a speaking part. [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8339.1s)]
*  He's an extra. [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8340.1s)]
*  That's how old this movie is. [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8341.82s)]
*  And so Sammy Davis Jr. is supposed to be making fun [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8343.38s)]
*  of Miles Davis? [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8345.66s)]
*  He's doing to Miles Davis. [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8347.019999999999s)]
*  He is, he's like, he's like, [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8348.619999999999s)]
*  he's a good trumpet player who, [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8350.779999999999s)]
*  cause all the jazz guys are in it, [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8354.78s)]
*  except Miles Davis. [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8356.86s)]
*  Dizzy Gillespie's in it. [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8359.820000000002s)]
*  All these are real jazz musicians. [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8361.18s)]
*  Could Sammy Davis Jr. really play? [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8364.78s)]
*  No, he couldn't play the trumpet. [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8366.94s)]
*  So is he faking it? [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8368.7s)]
*  Yeah. Look, Ozzy Davis, that's Cicely Tyson. [[02:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8369.74s)]
*  Is he definitely faking it? [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8378.220000000001s)]
*  Can I hear that? [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8379.42s)]
*  Boy, it sure looks like he's playing it. [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8380.26s)]
*  Movie magic. [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8400.1s)]
*  I don't think they had movie magic back then. [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8402.94s)]
*  Yeah, they did. [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8404.9s)]
*  I think he's playing it. [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8406.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8406.94s)]
*  I mean, he was a musician. [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8407.78s)]
*  I know. [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8408.62s)]
*  Look. [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8409.460000000001s)]
*  Okay, look, that's Willowna from Good Times. [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8410.300000000001s)]
*  And Frank Sinatra Jr. is in it too. [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8419.300000000001s)]
*  This is why I think that's really him. [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8431.300000000001s)]
*  Because if he ever, [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8433.26s)]
*  if he ever plays a movie, [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8434.34s)]
*  that's really him. [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8435.7s)]
*  Because if he ever listened to like a real solo, [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8436.66s)]
*  like someone who's really good. [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8441.220000000001s)]
*  This is him really playing. [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8444.300000000001s)]
*  This is drums. [[02:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8445.54s)]
*  Yeah, that's 100% him playing that trumpet. [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8458.380000000001s)]
*  There's no way a guy who plays drums this good [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8466.58s)]
*  would ever accept using a fake trumpet sound. [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8469.460000000001s)]
*  That's how much money they're paying him. [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8472.5s)]
*  I think he knows how to do it. [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8474.060000000001s)]
*  It was his movie. [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8475.1s)]
*  He did everything. [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8475.94s)]
*  I guarantee that guy could probably play everything. [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8476.980000000001s)]
*  You don't think Sammy Javits Jr. could play everything? [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8480.62s)]
*  He was a serious musician. [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8484.060000000001s)]
*  Jamie, I think you're hating. [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8486.42s)]
*  I'm just saying. [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8487.460000000001s)]
*  I think you're slightly hating. [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8488.300000000001s)]
*  I think perhaps you're hating. [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8489.94s)]
*  He can play it, okay. [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8490.94s)]
*  Yeah, he plays trumpet and drums and singing and coming. [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8491.980000000001s)]
*  But you know, it's like, [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8494.820000000002s)]
*  you see when a guy's like a real musician. [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8499.1s)]
*  You see the way their hands move. [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8501.02s)]
*  They just move better. [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8502.18s)]
*  Did you see when he was, [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8503.7s)]
*  his name was Rufus somebody. [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8505.86s)]
*  He was running for president. [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8507.34s)]
*  He was four years old. [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8508.66s)]
*  He was in a movie where he was, [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8510.5s)]
*  I forgot, it's the Sammy Javits Jr. [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8513.34s)]
*  and he's like four. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8515.58s)]
*  And he's like, he's got a top hat on. [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8517.58s)]
*  And it's just an old movie. [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8520.1s)]
*  I watch it turn into a classic movie sometimes. [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8521.74s)]
*  Who would you say is the best trumpet player? [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8524.02s)]
*  If there was one person? [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8527.62s)]
*  Who would be the elite of jazz trumpet players? [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8530.5s)]
*  Miles Davis, right? [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8535.34s)]
*  So let's listen to, [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8537.18s)]
*  so we just listened to that [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8541.42s)]
*  and we were trying to debate whether or not [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8543.140000000001s)]
*  Sammy Javits Jr. really played it. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8544.5s)]
*  Let's see what the top of the food chain is. [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8546.300000000001s)]
*  He's playing the cornet in that too. [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8548.34s)]
*  A cornet? [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8550.9s)]
*  That was the bigger one. [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8551.78s)]
*  That's the Chuck Mangione one he was playing. [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8554.54s)]
*  You know how, [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8556.5s)]
*  Dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan, dan. [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8557.34s)]
*  I'm ignorant about musical instruments. [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8559.900000000001s)]
*  So, [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8563.820000000002s)]
*  I was Googling four things at once here [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8567.460000000001s)]
*  because I was trying to find better evidence [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8568.86s)]
*  of him playing that [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8570.460000000001s)]
*  while I was trying to find what you were asking for too. [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8571.66s)]
*  But as I was thinking of why I was saying that [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8574.5s)]
*  is because I was thinking of this scene [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8576.220000000001s)]
*  in Crossroads the whole time [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8577.300000000001s)]
*  where Ralph Macchio is playing guitar against Steve Vai. [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8578.820000000002s)]
*  And it looks like he's playing guitar [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8581.18s)]
*  because in some of these scenes he is. [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8582.86s)]
*  But he's not good enough to play against him. [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8585.34s)]
*  He's not making that music. [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8587.7s)]
*  He's not good enough to be in a solo battle against him. [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8589.220000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8591.74s)]
*  He just practiced enough to do it. [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8592.58s)]
*  But don't you think the technology was far different [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8593.42s)]
*  in the Sammy Javits Jr. times? [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8596.060000000001s)]
*  Were they? [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8597.78s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8598.86s)]
*  Yeah, maybe. [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8599.7s)]
*  Maybe it was like two years later. [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8600.54s)]
*  Yeah, I think splicing the sound in there [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8601.36s)]
*  and having it sync up perfectly, [[02:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8603.58s)]
*  that's not an easy task back then. [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8606.220000000001s)]
*  I mean, I guess it probably could be done [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8608.980000000001s)]
*  by a wizard of special effects. [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8611.02s)]
*  Or you could just play Sammy Javits Jr. [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8613.220000000001s)]
*  playing the trumpet, which is what it looks like. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8615.5s)]
*  I just don't know why everything has to be [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8617.300000000001s)]
*  a conspiracy theory, Jamie. [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8619.62s)]
*  Well, I mean more for the movie aspect. [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8621.34s)]
*  I'll go back and find the clip again. [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8624.140000000001s)]
*  But they're cutting so much. [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8625.380000000001s)]
*  The way that would have been recorded, [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8628.060000000001s)]
*  they could have recorded him playing once [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8629.380000000001s)]
*  and then went back and reenacted him [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8630.94s)]
*  so they could have the camera moving all around him. [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8633.140000000001s)]
*  To have that all recorded perfectly [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8635.66s)]
*  and for it to sound as good as it did [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8637.26s)]
*  has to be edited in some way. [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8639.34s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8641.82s)]
*  As a movie. [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8642.66s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8643.98s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that's true. [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8645.22s)]
*  So there has to be some sound engineering too, right? [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8647.519999999999s)]
*  Whatever they could do back then [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8650.619999999999s)]
*  in the black and white days. [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8652.099999999999s)]
*  It's called A Man Called Adam is what this movie was called. [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8653.619999999999s)]
*  But let me, can you just show me like Miles Davis [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8656.8s)]
*  playing the trumpet? [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8659.9s)]
*  I just wanna, oh, is that what this is? [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8660.74s)]
*  I was googling five things at once. [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8662.38s)]
*  Oh, sorry. [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8664.92s)]
*  I guess it's. [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8665.76s)]
*  That's, that's um. [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8670.32s)]
*  Miles. [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8671.98s)]
*  It's way different playing those fast jazz. [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8675.82s)]
*  Miles' sound. [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8679.76s)]
*  And someone has to talk. [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8682.2s)]
*  Let's go back to this. [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8684.68s)]
*  It was a football song. [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8686.880000000001s)]
*  ["A Man Called Adam Is What This Is"] [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8695.76s)]
*  Look, Claudia, I have been in. [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8706.56s)]
*  Go back to the other one again. [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8708.28s)]
*  Is there anything with Miles Davis playing [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8710.880000000001s)]
*  where it's not people talking? [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8713.28s)]
*  Speaking of Miles, she was his wife. [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8721.02s)]
*  Cicely Tyson was his wife. [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8723.960000000001s)]
*  She was married to Miles. [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8726.28s)]
*  Here we go. [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8729.12s)]
*  ["A Man Called Adam Is What This Is"] [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8733.640000000001s)]
*  ["A Man Called Adam Is What This Is"] [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8737.96s)]

*  ["A Man Called Adam Is What This Is"] [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8759.48s)]
*  ["A Man Called Adam Is What This Is"] [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8767.96s)]
*  Something people really love about jazz, [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8780.16s)]
*  the improvised aspect of it. [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8782.759999999998s)]
*  You know? [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8786.88s)]
*  They can smoke cigarettes and play instruments. [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8788.24s)]
*  I didn't, I didn't really enjoy it that much [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8790.56s)]
*  until just now. [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8794.64s)]
*  I like that. [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8796.839999999998s)]
*  I was listening to that. [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8798.119999999999s)]
*  I was like, oh, this might be the way to do it. [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8798.96s)]
*  Don't do it while you're doing other stuff. [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8801.359999999999s)]
*  Just sit there and listen to it. [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8803.519999999999s)]
*  I like things without lyrics as background music. [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8808.519999999999s)]
*  When I write, I like to put classical music [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8810.839999999998s)]
*  or maybe music in other languages [[02:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8813.24s)]
*  so I don't know what they're saying. [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8815.8s)]
*  And so it only gets in so far. [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8817.32s)]
*  I'm not thinking about their words. [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8820.16s)]
*  Lately I've been listening to a lot of this healing, [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8822.240000000002s)]
*  this chanting stuff, like the waves. [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8826.08s)]
*  Not water, but you see it on YouTube all the time. [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8830.76s)]
*  And it'll say it heals you or you can sleep for two hours [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8835.44s)]
*  and wake up like you slept for eight hours. [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8839.44s)]
*  It's just like, it's just. [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8842.560000000001s)]
*  Oh, I think I know what you're talking about. [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8845.44s)]
*  Megahertz or something like that. [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8846.880000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8848.52s)]
*  Binaural beats? [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8849.800000000001s)]
*  That's right. [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8850.640000000001s)]
*  Binaural beats, yeah. [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8851.56s)]
*  I gotta start remembering the names of this shit. [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8854.08s)]
*  I don't know if that helps you [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8856.4s)]
*  where you don't need as much sleep. [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8858.08s)]
*  What does this most do for you? [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8860.88s)]
*  What are the pros? [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8861.92s)]
*  It definitely puts you in a relaxing state. [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8863.439999999999s)]
*  There's a big talk about 432 hertz. [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8864.64s)]
*  It makes me, I'm gonna tell you. [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8867.32s)]
*  It feels like I'm like a egg, [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8869.199999999999s)]
*  like not a big, like a chicken egg, [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8874.92s)]
*  but those eggs you have on a piece of furniture. [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8876.64s)]
*  You know, like something you put on a coffee table [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8879.96s)]
*  and it's on a pillow. [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8883.8s)]
*  And when I listen to that music, [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8885.88s)]
*  that's how I feel like I'm on it. [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8886.919999999998s)]
*  I'm just like, like I just, [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8888.439999999999s)]
*  like I just sink into the bed. [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8893.16s)]
*  But it's not the bed I'm sinking into. [[02:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8895.96s)]
*  It's the sound I sink. [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8898.32s)]
*  I don't know how to, it's like I just kinda sink into this, [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8901.72s)]
*  into the bed that just, I'm just there, [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8907.119999999999s)]
*  but I'm not like laying on the bed. [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8912.439999999999s)]
*  And I'm just, yeah, when I wake up I feel like, yeah! [[02:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8914.76s)]
*  Let's go. [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8918.76s)]
*  Really? [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8920.24s)]
*  Yeah, and it's not music, is it? [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8921.08s)]
*  It's more like just sounds, but it's good. [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8922.76s)]
*  And so how much time do you do it for? [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8927.76s)]
*  I sleep to it. [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8929.76s)]
*  You sleep to it? [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8930.88s)]
*  I sleep to it. [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8931.72s)]
*  Like if I gotta catch a flight at whatever time, at seven, [[02:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8932.56s)]
*  and I know I can't afford to sleep too long, [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8937.72s)]
*  but I know if I put that on for two hours, [[02:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8943.199999999999s)]
*  boom, when I do get up, I will get up, [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8946.64s)]
*  and I get up and I'm good. [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8948.76s)]
*  I won't be like, oh my God, I gotta go. [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8951.0s)]

*  when you go to sleep? [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8960.84s)]
*  I just play it on my iPad or something like that. [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8961.68s)]
*  Just put a speaker? [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8964.960000000001s)]
*  Or either I put my earbuds in, [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8966.08s)]

*  it's someone just, he's just floating. [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8974.56s)]
*  He's like in your seat, he's just floating. [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8977.56s)]
*  And the ones you listen to, how long does it go for? [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8981.36s)]
*  They got some of them for 10 hours, six hours, three hours. [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8984.56s)]
*  10 hours? [[02:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8987.800000000001s)]
*  You could just put up there two hours of, [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8988.64s)]
*  sometimes it's under Zen sleep music or healing music. [[02:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8993.32s)]
*  It just, yeah, it's good. [[02:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=8998.4s)]
*  That's interesting. [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9002.599999999999s)]
*  I haven't experimented with that. [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9003.439999999999s)]
*  I'm gonna know. [[02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9004.84s)]
*  Now that I'm thinking about it, I'm kinda interested. [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9005.68s)]
*  I'm gonna do that shit and I'm gonna get in the hot, [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9007.519999999999s)]
*  in the cold tub at the same time. [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9008.519999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I'm interested in it now. [[02:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9010.68s)]
*  Yeah, can you pull that up? [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9013.48s)]
*  Because when you see it, [[02:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9015.92s)]
*  you'll see what I'm trying to describe to you, [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9017.16s)]
*  how you feel when you're sleeping. [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9020.28s)]
*  It makes sense because music has such an intense effect [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9022.32s)]
*  on people, intense effect on the way you feel. [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9026.12s)]
*  It gives you goosebumps, gets you excited, [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9028.52s)]
*  gets your body moving. [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9030.84s)]
*  And it just makes sense that it's interacting with us [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9032.36s)]
*  in a way other than the obvious, we hear it. [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9035.36s)]
*  We don't just hear it, it gives you emotions. [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9038.960000000001s)]
*  It sort of changes the way you feel. [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9041.72s)]
*  Anyone in particular? [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9044.599999999999s)]
*  Because it's one where a guy's just laying there. [[02:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9048.679999999998s)]
*  Like that one. That's it? [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9052.56s)]
*  Okay, is this here? [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9054.64s)]
*  Let's put the headphones on. [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9055.8s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9061.439999999999s)]
*  So you sleep to this? [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9063.32s)]
*  Yeah, I do. [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9064.72s)]
*  I wanna lay down now. [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9066.119999999999s)]
*  It's good, I tell you. Wow. [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9067.48s)]
*  This goes on for eight hours? [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9070.56s)]
*  Well, how many hours? [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9072.4s)]
*  So it's 11 hours and 16 minutes. [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9073.52s)]
*  11 hours. [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9075.0s)]
*  It's perfect, that's what I need. [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9076.199999999999s)]
*  11 hours of sleep. [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9077.96s)]
*  It's also good if you're a YouTube subscriber [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9080.68s)]
*  or whatever. Yeah. [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9082.64s)]
*  Put it on your phone, shut the thing. [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9084.0s)]
*  It just restarts, it's like a loop, I think. [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9087.64s)]
*  Yeah, this could be very psychedelic. [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9089.24s)]
*  It's good. [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9092.8s)]
*  You know, you could have some wild ass dreams [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9093.64s)]
*  steered by this music. [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9096.16s)]
*  I could drink, wake up. [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9097.72s)]
*  It's like, you know how you're like, [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9100.439999999999s)]
*  none of that. [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9101.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9103.24s)]
*  Like, just, if I have eaten, I don't feel full. [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9104.08s)]
*  If I have not eaten, I don't feel hungry. [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9108.84s)]
*  Yeah, it's just kinda, I'm just, [[02:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9112.359999999999s)]
*  just with your fine-sale pill, I'm just there somewhere. [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9115.6s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9118.48s)]
*  Just like, yeah. [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9119.32s)]
*  Locked in. [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9120.08s)]
*  Yeah, but it's not like I'm laying on a table. [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9120.92s)]
*  It's like, I'm just, I'm right here. [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9124.48s)]
*  Floating, you're good. [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9127.279999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I'm gonna try it. [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9128.8s)]
*  I'm gonna try it. [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9130.519999999999s)]
*  I've used noise machines before, [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9131.359999999999s)]
*  but I kinda like to sleep in. [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9132.56s)]
*  I like to hear things. [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9134.96s)]
*  Oh, the dog gonna love it too. [[02:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9136.0s)]
*  Yeah? [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9138.0s)]
*  The dog, yeah, the dog loves it. [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9138.84s)]
*  The dog, my mom's dog is just sleeping like that. [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9140.16s)]
*  Quick update, this is the guy who played the trumpet for you. [[02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9142.56s)]
*  Put that music on, shut up. [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9145.32s)]
*  This is the trumpet player from the movie. [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9146.519999999999s)]
*  Oh, that's the guy from the movie? [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9148.24s)]
*  Yeah, trumpet playing was done by Nat Adderley. [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9149.72s)]
*  Oh, so it was actually Sammy Davis' Junior's trumpet? [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9153.279999999999s)]
*  It was overdubbed. [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9156.92s)]
*  Oh my God, Jamie's right? [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9157.800000000001s)]
*  This motherfucker, we call him a conspiracy theorist, [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9159.72s)]
*  but he was right. [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9161.76s)]
*  I mean, I have a degree. [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9162.6s)]
*  How did you know? [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9163.68s)]
*  Because I went to school to make sound for movies and stuff. [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9164.56s)]
*  That's what you do. [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9168.64s)]
*  99% of all sound in a movie is redone. [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9169.6s)]
*  It's not recorded live. [[02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9173.36s)]
*  I just naively thought that Sammy Davis' Junior [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9174.92s)]
*  wouldn't want another man to play trumpet for him. [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9178.800000000001s)]
*  It's almost impossible for them to have recorded that [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9180.72s)]
*  in that setting, and it sounded that good. [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9182.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9185.08s)]
*  They were in a space with production. [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9186.28s)]
*  There's 100,000 people. [[02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9187.800000000001s)]
*  There's people around, no one's shutting up. [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9189.12s)]
*  Think of it all at your shows. [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9190.960000000001s)]
*  No one can make a sound or kind of ruin something. [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9193.480000000001s)]
*  If he's playing a one-time performance. [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9195.960000000001s)]
*  Glasses, people walking in, people walking out. [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9197.92s)]
*  Like, you know, they're in New York, so. [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9200.68s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9203.08s)]
*  I heard Tommy talking about this. [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9203.92s)]
*  He said in his first taping, [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9205.08s)]
*  people were walking around in the background and stuff, [[02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9206.28s)]
*  and the people that, well, they were like, [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9208.76s)]
*  we can't use this, but that's the performance that was good. [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9210.2s)]
*  So you have to. [[02:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9213.28s)]
*  You have to use that one, and they did. [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9215.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9216.92s)]
*  But he was like, you can't worry about that stuff. [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9217.76s)]
*  Wow. [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9219.64s)]
*  So, here you go. [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9222.32s)]
*  Yeah, people do weird stuff with sets sometimes. [[02:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9224.68s)]
*  Like, when you, I'm not gonna talk about this. [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9233.88s)]
*  I was just thinking about, [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9237.24s)]
*  I was just thinking about Aziz Ansari's set, [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9238.84s)]
*  that one that he did with Spike Jonze, [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9240.96s)]
*  where they showed the background. [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9243.92s)]
*  Like, it was just so distracting to me. [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9246.08s)]
*  Like, I didn't understand why they would do that. [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9248.32s)]
*  Like, you could see the people working in backstage [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9250.04s)]
*  while he was on stage. [[02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9253.16s)]
*  It was like at an angle. [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9254.08s)]
*  Instead of like straight on at him, [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9255.36s)]
*  it was like at an angle where you could see [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9257.2s)]
*  like the sound guy and everybody. [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9258.84s)]
*  No, no, it was, it was a, [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9260.76s)]
*  I think it was a Netflix special. [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9263.92s)]
*  But it was just, Spike Jonze directed it. [[02:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9265.72s)]
*  And it was like this weird choice [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9269.44s)]
*  that they had decided to make. [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9272.16s)]
*  Like, have it shot where it looks more, [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9274.519999999999s)]
*  I guess more organic. [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9277.199999999999s)]
*  Like, you just happen to be there watching. [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9278.24s)]
*  That? [[02:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9280.84s)]
*  No. [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9281.679999999998s)]
*  Yeah, you can see, yeah, that's it. [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9283.0s)]
*  You could see the backstage area. [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9284.48s)]
*  So like, there would be people walk, [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9288.119999999999s)]
*  see where his right hand is? [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9290.08s)]
*  There'd be people walking back there and shit. [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9291.32s)]
*  It was weird. [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9293.76s)]
*  Like, to the door, the exit door and shit. [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9296.76s)]
*  It's very odd. [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9300.119999999999s)]
*  But I guess it's like to give you this feeling [[02:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9301.6s)]
*  that you're in. [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9303.92s)]
*  A taping. [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9305.640000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9306.48s)]
*  That you're in the club instead of, [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9307.32s)]
*  it's like more informal, I guess. [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9308.640000000001s)]
*  More relaxed. [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9311.32s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9313.0s)]
*  But it takes, it's like, [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9313.960000000001s)]
*  why is there people walking behind Aziz? [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9315.08s)]
*  Why am I looking at people walking in the background? [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9317.68s)]
*  Why is that in my mind? [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9320.48s)]
*  Yeah, cause it seems like it would be distracting. [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9322.08s)]
*  It's distracting. [[02:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9324.48s)]
*  Have you been to the stand in New York? [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9325.640000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9328.68s)]
*  The room upstairs, they got the window open. [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9330.0s)]
*  Like, what the fuck is that, man? [[02:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9332.76s)]
*  Like, cause I can't talk to y'all with these people. [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9334.36s)]
*  They're doing stuff back there [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9340.12s)]
*  and they're not paying attention. [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9341.32s)]
*  They just, it's like you're in a fishbowl. [[02:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9343.32s)]
*  And I'm like, close that curtain. [[02:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9345.24s)]
*  That is so not cool, man. [[02:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9347.16s)]
*  It's weird. [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9349.640000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9350.48s)]
*  Yeah, but that's another one of those ones, [[02:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9351.32s)]
*  like, you know, a comedian didn't set that up. [[02:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9352.880000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9355.2s)]
*  Right. [[02:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9356.24s)]
*  I did the club that me and Louie did in Rotterdam. [[02:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9357.2s)]
*  It's called Club Hog. [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9362.2s)]
*  So if you ever go to Rotterdam, you gotta do that. [[02:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9364.039999999999s)]
*  As a matter of fact, the last time I was there, [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9366.28s)]
*  I filmed, I did footage, an hour of footage, [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9368.12s)]
*  but the ceiling is low. [[02:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9372.12s)]
*  It's like, yeah, the ceiling is low. [[02:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9373.92s)]
*  There's no bad seats. [[02:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9377.08s)]
*  And, you know, but, you know, [[02:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9379.16s)]
*  they speak another language, [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9381.52s)]
*  but they understand you cause they speak, [[02:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9382.8s)]
*  like three languages. [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9385.88s)]
*  Dutch is French, English, and German mixed together. [[02:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9387.039999999999s)]
*  Plus they watch American television. [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9389.919999999998s)]
*  So their English comprehension is super good. [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9391.8s)]
*  Wow. [[02:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9395.519999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so if you ever pop over there, you gotta do that. [[02:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9396.8s)]
*  That must be fun doing countries like that. [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9400.439999999999s)]
*  It's pretty impressive that they have that [[02:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9403.88s)]
*  good of a grasp of English, like universally. [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9406.16s)]
*  Like we're basically, [[02:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9409.679999999998s)]
*  you either speak Spanish in this country [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9411.64s)]
*  or you speak English. [[02:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9413.279999999999s)]
*  We speak English and Spanish. [[02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9414.960000000001s)]
*  We speak a gang of different languages. [[02:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9415.960000000001s)]
*  In Holland, they understand us better [[02:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9417.84s)]
*  than they do English people. [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9419.960000000001s)]
*  Cause, yeah. [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9423.04s)]
*  I think Spanish is the next language. [[02:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9424.24s)]
*  If I was gonna learn a second language, [[02:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9425.960000000001s)]
*  that seems like the most useful one, you know? [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9427.68s)]
*  And also it's like, it's everywhere. [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9431.28s)]
*  Might be Russian. [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9433.480000000001s)]
*  Russian. [[02:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9435.28s)]
*  I don't wanna throw in the towel just yet. [[02:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9436.12s)]
*  Plus that one you have to learn like a whole different [[02:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9439.720000000001s)]
*  alphabet. [[02:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9441.880000000001s)]
*  You have to learn all the way they write their letters [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9442.96s)]
*  and everything. [[02:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9445.679999999998s)]
*  It's like very strange. [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9446.519999999999s)]
*  It's so cool looking. [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9447.839999999998s)]
*  We all start popping out like that aunt who had that [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9449.599999999999s)]
*  fungus, that shit. [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9452.199999999999s)]
*  All the Russians coming to gas mask. [[02:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9454.039999999999s)]
*  Do you smell the trees burning? [[02:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9458.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9460.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9461.48s)]
*  Do you get worried about this whole Ukraine War thing? [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9463.279999999999s)]
*  It seems a little, [[02:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9466.0s)]
*  speaking of Amsterdam, [[02:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9469.4s)]
*  we're in Amsterdam. [[02:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9471.039999999999s)]
*  There's a Russian comedian over there. [[02:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9471.960000000001s)]
*  He's doing a spot at the Comedy Cafe over in Amsterdam. [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9473.48s)]
*  We're like, hey, you guys. [[02:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9478.0s)]
*  And he goes, that's just media. [[02:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9479.72s)]
*  There's no war. [[02:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9481.28s)]
*  That's what these Russian people say. [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9482.52s)]
*  There's no war. [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9483.36s)]
*  So the Russians don't believe the war's real? [[02:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9486.08s)]
*  Maybe that was just that group. [[02:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9488.12s)]
*  Cause they just said, no, that's ridiculous. [[02:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9490.12s)]
*  Well, here's the thing. [[02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9492.52s)]
*  Russia does not have an open society. [[02:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9494.84s)]
*  Like you can't just print anything you want in the news. [[02:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9498.24s)]
*  You can't just, [[02:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9501.4s)]
*  they don't have the kind of freedom to talk about stories [[02:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9503.359999999999s)]
*  that we have in America. [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9508.08s)]
*  They have control of their internet. [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9509.08s)]
*  And they also punish dissidents. [[02:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9511.4s)]
*  They punish people. [[02:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9513.16s)]
*  So if you're over there, [[02:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9514.4s)]
*  you want to believe what they tell you? [[02:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9517.4s)]
*  Who knows what they tell you? [[02:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9520.32s)]
*  What do the people in Russia think is going on with Ukraine? [[02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9521.56s)]
*  We didn't get that deep into it. [[02:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9525.119999999999s)]
*  Cause of course one of the other comedians [[02:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9526.92s)]
*  said something to them about the war. [[02:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9529.28s)]
*  And they go, that's not true. [[02:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9531.36s)]
*  That's just what they put on television. [[02:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9532.84s)]
*  They want you to believe that, but there's no war. [[02:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9535.960000000001s)]
*  Are there the Russian equivalents to people that tell you [[02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9537.880000000001s)]
*  that Trump won the election? [[02:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9540.12s)]
*  I guess probably, yeah. [[02:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9542.24s)]
*  Trump won that election. [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9543.28s)]
*  He's my president. [[02:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9544.84s)]
*  Yes. [[02:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9546.52s)]
*  Maybe the Russian equivalent of that. [[02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9548.880000000001s)]
*  But in America, at least you have- [[02:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9550.16s)]
*  In Florida they wear the shirts with the flag on them. [[02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9551.0s)]
*  I don't need a mask, I'm free. [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9553.560000000001s)]
*  If you are in Russia, [[02:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9556.0s)]
*  how much access to the actual news do you have? [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9558.64s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9562.16s)]
*  How much access to the way the whole world, [[02:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9563.0s)]
*  how dangerous is that for you? [[02:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9566.36s)]
*  If you decide to use a firewall, some sort of a VPN- [[02:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9568.32s)]
*  These people were in Amsterdam. [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9573.72s)]
*  This guy, whoever he is, is a big comedian in Russia. [[02:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9575.04s)]
*  And they were doing something there [[02:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9578.32s)]
*  for all Russian audience. [[02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9579.6s)]
*  And they looked at us like we would, [[02:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9582.52s)]
*  I wasn't doing the questioning. [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9585.08s)]
*  Like you were naive. [[02:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9586.8s)]
*  Like, you guys believe that? [[02:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9588.0s)]
*  That's not even real. [[02:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9590.64s)]
*  That's just media hype or something. [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9591.56s)]
*  Damn. [[02:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9595.8s)]
*  Like, wow. [[02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9596.64s)]
*  Imagine being that confident. [[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9600.0s)]
*  Yeah, they were. [[02:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9601.52s)]
*  Why would you be that confident? [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9603.72s)]
*  Yeah, they were. [[02:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9605.8s)]
*  They were that confident to tell us, [[02:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9606.92s)]
*  yeah, basically you don't know what you're talking about. [[02:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9610.24s)]
*  Please don't believe that. [[02:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9613.72s)]
*  And there were some comedians from England [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9616.8s)]
*  and there was us, American, [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9618.4s)]
*  and we all said, no, no, no, there's a war. [[02:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9620.24s)]
*  We're gonna do our comedy show in here tonight. [[02:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9626.08s)]
*  We're gonna laugh it up. [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9628.48s)]
*  Go do what the fucking Americans and English people do. [[02:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9629.84s)]
*  And Dutch people do. [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9633.76s)]
*  Yeah, it's like, wow. [[02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9635.32s)]
*  Wow. [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9637.76s)]
*  If you don't know, you don't know. [[02:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9638.76s)]
*  It's not that he didn't know, right? [[02:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9640.96s)]
*  He doesn't wanna talk about it. [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9643.32s)]
*  That's what it sounds like. [[02:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9644.68s)]
*  Yeah, but it wasn't just one person. [[02:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9646.16s)]
*  Like, hey, what do you guys think about that? [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9650.88s)]
*  Oh, come on, enough with this already. [[02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9652.68s)]
*  Ah da da da da da da da. [[02:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9655.039999999999s)]
*  Yeah, maybe he's just tired of talking about it. [[02:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9657.0s)]
*  Maybe. [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9659.36s)]
*  He's been talking about it, I bet, for a year. [[02:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9660.2s)]
*  Imagine being a Russian dude. [[02:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9662.12s)]
*  Everywhere you go, they're asking you about Ukraine. [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9663.44s)]
*  You're like, what the fuck do you want me to do? [[02:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9665.039999999999s)]
*  What do you want me to do? [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9667.92s)]
*  I'm over here selling watches. [[02:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9669.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9671.16s)]
*  What do you want me to do? [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9672.08s)]
*  You know? [[02:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9673.16s)]
*  It's just weird that a comedian is running the country. [[02:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9678.44s)]
*  Wild. [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9683.28s)]
*  And you saw him play the piano with his dick? [[02:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9684.12s)]
*  No, no. [[02:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9686.68s)]
*  You didn't see that? [[02:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9687.52s)]
*  No, I didn't see that. [[02:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9688.36s)]
*  I didn't see it. [[02:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9689.2s)]
*  Did he do it, though? [[02:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9690.04s)]
*  No. He did. [[02:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9690.88s)]
*  No. [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9691.72s)]
*  That's what was going on across the street. [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9692.56s)]
*  That's, no, okay. [[02:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9693.72s)]
*  But didn't Zelensky do something like that? [[02:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9694.56s)]
*  Oh, I don't know. [[02:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9696.2s)]
*  Oh, I don't know about that. [[02:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9697.04s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I think he did. [[02:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9697.86s)]
*  Did he do that? [[02:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9698.7s)]
*  Yeah, I think it was part of his act. [[02:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9700.28s)]
*  Oh, but I was talking about the guys [[02:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9702.48s)]
*  from Puppetry the Penis. [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9704.36s)]
*  Right. [[02:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9706.76s)]
*  They had their show. [[02:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9707.6s)]
*  Me and Grier were in this venue, [[02:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9709.24s)]
*  and he was in that venue. [[02:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9710.96s)]
*  So we all come out. [[02:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9712.28s)]
*  Okay, I'm confused, because I think I watched a video [[02:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9713.119999999999s)]
*  of Zelensky doing this comedy routine [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9716.36s)]
*  where he's in front of a piano. [[02:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9718.92s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, okay. [[02:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9722.8s)]
*  Playing piano with his penis, yeah. [[02:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9723.64s)]
*  So, but they don't see their penises, [[02:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9725.28s)]
*  so who knows what's really going on. [[02:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9728.119999999999s)]
*  They do take their pants down. [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9730.039999999999s)]
*  Here it goes. [[02:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9732.439999999999s)]
*  Let me hear some. [[02:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9733.279999999999s)]
*  Oh, God, man. [[02:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9734.119999999999s)]
*  Is it gonna get in? [[02:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9734.96s)]
*  It's gonna get in. [[02:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9735.8s)]
*  It's gonna get in. [[02:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9736.64s)]
*  No. [[02:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9737.46s)]
*  They're not really making that noise. [[02:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9738.3s)]
*  No. [[02:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9743.08s)]
*  They're not really making that noise. [[02:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9744.439999999999s)]
*  Right? [[02:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9746.0s)]
*  I don't think that. [[02:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9746.84s)]
*  Now, you were skeptical before. [[02:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9748.16s)]
*  I, you wouldn't believe that that one was. [[02:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9750.48s)]
*  Now, this is serious. [[02:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9752.32s)]
*  No, I'm just kidding. [[02:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9753.359999999999s)]
*  You think that one's real? [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9754.199999999999s)]
*  I'm very skeptical. [[02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9756.24s)]
*  Very skeptical that that was real. [[02:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9758.339999999998s)]
*  Yeah, no shit, you can't even see the piano. [[02:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9760.3s)]
*  There's probably no piano. [[02:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9761.82s)]
*  Tony Woods, I love you. [[02:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL8FOmkEgdQ&t=9762.66s)]
