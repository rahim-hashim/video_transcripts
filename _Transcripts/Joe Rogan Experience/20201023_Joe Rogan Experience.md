# Joe Rogan Experience #1553 - Maynard James Keenan
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [October 23, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz0ka4DuxPw)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day!
*  Oh hello, man. Hey, bro.
*  Is this how you're wearing your mask now? On the wrist? That's cool.
*  I just forget to bring it with me, so if I just like hang it on my nose, I just bring it.
*  That's a new move. Yeah.
*  People will do that now. They will see you and they'll say, one side of the watch, other side of the watch.
*  Put your miniature schnauzer right here.
*  Aww. You have a cute little dog, dude. That picture of your dog is adorable.
*  Yeah, she's awesome. She's out. What's her name? Taking a walk. Miho.
*  Miho? Yeah, she's 15.
*  What does Miho stand for?
*  Beauty, crest of a wave. It's Japanese.
*  Oh, okay. Deadly little Miho from Sin City.
*  Which one was that? She had the swords in the corner. Oh, right.
*  From the movie? Sin City. Sin City was a movie, but it was also a comic book, right?
*  Comic book, yeah. Was she in the comic book as well? I don't know.
*  That movie was fucking good, man. I forgot all about that movie until just now.
*  Yeah, she's named after a deadly little Miho.
*  So we were talking about how, well, we didn't talk about how the new Puss in a Boat album comes out on the 30th.
*  I listened to What Is Available and it sounds awesome. There's a lot of layers to that shit, man.
*  There's all kinds of sounds coming at you from all over the place.
*  Yeah, Matt, normally what happens with our recording process is that I'll have an idea or Matt will have an idea
*  and we'll just kind of set down a direction. For example, like I'll go mandolin, drum machine, banjo.
*  Let's just start there and start to see what we can build on this thing.
*  And then you have an album like Conditions of My Parole.
*  On this, he picked up an old Fairlight and making a Fairlight actually work nowadays.
*  I don't know what a Fairlight is. It's a synthesizer and you've heard it on, you know, Peter Gabriel used it, Art of Noise.
*  I think Yes might have used versions like a Synclovior or a Fairlight.
*  I'm going to get that wrong and Matt's going to just, he's got his face in his palm right now.
*  But, you know, so there's very specific sounds that come out of these and there's a learning curve to go with it.
*  But the cool thing is that it kind of paints you into a sonic corner and then you start layering on that.
*  And then of course, unconsciously or consciously, you start thinking of all the stuff you heard in the 80s, you know, that was used on.
*  So you start reacting in that way for those sounds.
*  And then, you know, Karina coming in on top of me, adding her piece.
*  And then just that kind of, you know, that kind of three-way chess that we have going on.
*  As a non-musician, it's always interesting to see, like, the way people react to synthesizers.
*  Synthesizers got to be one of the most polarizing sounds.
*  But obviously it's responsible for some amazing songs, undeniably.
*  But for whatever reason, people either love or hate that kind of sound.
*  Well, yeah, whenever, you know, when you have people that are like, I don't know, man, I like live music, you know, totally live music.
*  So you're a big, you know, and then you kind of wait, come back around, go, what do you think of Kraftwerk?
*  I love Kraftwerk.
*  They put robots on station, push a button, and you pay money to watch, like, four mannequins play the songs.
*  It's basically Chuck E. Cheese.
*  But I love Kraftwerk. And, you know, so but it's funny when people don't quite make the connection of they don't know what it is they're saying.
*  Well, it becomes almost an ideological thing.
*  It's like you're opposed to it because it's a non-cool thing or something.
*  Yeah.
*  Do you remember when Jump came out and everybody was like, what the fuck has happened to Van Halen?
*  Have they lost their mind? What is this?
*  Meanwhile, one of the biggest fucking songs they've ever put out.
*  Yeah.
*  A massive super blockbuster.
*  Yeah.
*  But some people were just like, this is the end.
*  Well, I remember living in Boston.
*  We had the classic rock station play.
*  AAF or WBCN?
*  I think it was, it might have been BCN. What's the other one?
*  AAF, BCN.
*  I think it was BCN. But it was like it was a classic rock channel.
*  And this was 87, 88.
*  I was there.
*  And I remember people losing their shit because they tried to play Van Halen on that station.
*  And I'm like, that's not classic rock, bro.
*  They really were very adamant about like, no, no, no, no, no. Van Halen is hair band.
*  That's like some kind of glam rock thing.
*  They were Bostonians just getting their panties in a bunch over Van Halen on BCN.
*  Yeah. There was a real resistance to hair metal.
*  There's hair band music came around and even guns and roses.
*  Like people put in the hair band category and I'm like, boy, you're splitting hairs.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  It's hardly hair band music.
*  I mean, it's Sweet Child of Mine and like, you know, Welcome to the Jungle.
*  These are fucking great songs.
*  It's hard. Like hair band to me is like I get why people would like it.
*  I understand it, but it's simple.
*  It's like it's a piece of candy.
*  Yes.
*  You know, whereas like, you know, guns and roses had, they put out some fine meals.
*  You know, some of their songs were, you know, there were.
*  It was one meal, but it was a good meal.
*  But they were like well crafted pieces.
*  Whereas, you know, there's I don't want to name some bands, but there's some, you know, some bands that were eyelash extensions and fucking crazy hair and.
*  Bowie.
*  Bowie. He did do.
*  Yeah, that's right.
*  You're right. Good point.
*  Yeah, but.
*  Nobody's giving him shit.
*  No, you can't give him shit.
*  He's well, how undeniable was Michael Jackson that even though people think he most likely did some horrible shit, they still play his music.
*  Yeah.
*  And oddly enough, the the Fairlight is part of some of those records.
*  Sure.
*  Boom, boom, boom, boom.
*  That's all those.
*  That's all those synthesizers are talking about.
*  When did synthesizers come around?
*  Like, what was the first introduction?
*  Like when did they hit modern music?
*  I'm having a brain fart.
*  Damn it.
*  It'll come.
*  OK.
*  It's it's a it's a it's a specific.
*  But there was there was sound manipulation that band started introducing prior to that, right?
*  Like Hendrix started doing weird shit with pedals and.
*  You got a mellotron, which is like kind of recorded on tape and it's looped and you're playing the recorded sounds on these on these looping cassettes.
*  But that was still kind of analog.
*  And I'm having there's a specific keyboard and I'm bad at that.
*  It must be the 56, bro.
*  Dude, I'm 53.
*  I get it.
*  My my brain is my my memory is so inconsistent.
*  Like sometimes it's amazing.
*  And sometimes it's just straight dog shit.
*  Like people I've known for 10 years.
*  I can't remember the fucking name.
*  It doesn't make any sense.
*  Things that I know what that thing is and I can't fucking.
*  It's by the way, it's good to see George over here.
*  George, George, his name is Brian.
*  Oh, we should probably explain what's happened.
*  This almost doesn't happen.
*  Young Jamie got the covid.
*  Young Jamie's got a new lady friend and the new lady friend wanted to go to a bar and young Jamie was like, OK.
*  So he went to a bar and bars in Texas.
*  They do not give a fuck out here.
*  They they go outside and they're on a patio and they just drink like there's no covid.
*  And they're bumping a bumper with people all partying down.
*  And a few days later, Jamie thought he had a sinus infection.
*  He was just all stuffed up and felt like shit only for a day.
*  And the next day started to feel better.
*  The day after that, he's like, I can't be covid.
*  He's like, I know I have allergies.
*  He has allergies and it's ragweed season, apparently comes in, gets tested.
*  And the only one we were concerned with is our employee, Jeff, our friend Jeff.
*  And Jeff was actually fairly close to Jamie for a few minutes talking to him.
*  I never got any closer than 20 feet from him.
*  And most of the time I was about 30 to 40 feet from him.
*  Soon as I found because Jamie came in first and got tested first.
*  And as soon as I found he didn't feel well, I stayed the fuck away from him.
*  I thought because I was in the room with him, maybe I would have to quarantine.
*  But the doctor said, how close were you?
*  And I was like, no closer than 20 feet.
*  So you don't have to worry about it.
*  Just get tested every day.
*  And so I'm three negative tests in a row.
*  So I'm 99.999 percent sure I'm good.
*  But Jeff, I'm a little worried about.
*  So Jeff's not here today.
*  Poor bastard.
*  But we almost didn't do it because I thought the protocol was I was going to have to stay.
*  But they said, no, they consider close contact six feet or closer for more than 15 minutes.
*  Really close.
*  Oh, that kind of close.
*  Yeah.
*  I wonder if you do you get it from fucking Brian?
*  You would know.
*  Yeah, absolutely.
*  It's liquids.
*  That's how I got mine.
*  Did you?
*  Wow.
*  Amazing.
*  But you fuck so much.
*  How would you know that's how you got?
*  I fucked myself.
*  Oh, because you're not sure.
*  So anyway, we pulled it off and we did do it.
*  So here we are.
*  The other thing that's coming out tomorrow is a tape where apparently Rudy Giuliani tries to fuck a 15 year old.
*  Allegedly, allegedly, allegedly.
*  What's funny is like apparently his take on it.
*  And again, he's older than us.
*  So his memory is probably terrible because it happened quite a while ago that they filmed this.
*  His take on it was he was proud that they didn't get him to do it.
*  They were proud that they didn't get him the way they've got other people.
*  And the article that I was reading last night, it's the death of journalism is so goddamn apparent when you read articles and then you see the actual thing and you go, what the fuck did you just write?
*  Because this is not what it is.
*  Right.
*  This is like these takes on things that are so it's there.
*  There's so much hyperbole and there's so much exaggeration and bias until we watch it.
*  We won't be able to.
*  Yeah.
*  So I'm excited.
*  Tomorrow though.
*  But you know, you had me at Borat.
*  Yeah, I had Borat.
*  I mean, listen, I still think Ali G.
*  Into House is one of the most underrated comedy films of all time.
*  It is good.
*  Especially if you like weed.
*  I wouldn't recommend it this month, Sober October.
*  But when Sober October is over, Ali G.
*  Into House, I actually bought a UK version of a VHS player because it was only available on VHS from the UK.
*  Was it VHS or DVD?
*  Are you talking about the actual Ali G. series?
*  No, it was a movie.
*  Okay.
*  Oh yeah, that one too.
*  But even the series wasn't available over here for a long time.
*  Right.
*  You had to do the conversion.
*  But he had a movie.
*  You're right, Brian.
*  It was a DVD and it was in all regions.
*  I had to buy an all regions player.
*  And because players were limited to certain regions.
*  It was really weird.
*  I had that too.
*  Do you know what the science behind that is?
*  It was different frequencies.
*  I think it was PAL versus HSC.
*  NTSC.
*  NTSC or something like that.
*  And some of them were universal.
*  They would play everything.
*  Yeah, some of the cheaper ones that you could buy at Fry's had a secret menu.
*  You could switch it back and forth.
*  Yeah, that was the key, right?
*  It was like a cheaper one.
*  Yeah.
*  So I had to buy one.
*  I literally bought a DVD player specifically for this film.
*  Me and Eddie Bravo got barbecued.
*  And we watched this and could not stop laughing.
*  It's a fucking hilarious movie.
*  It's really ridiculous.
*  So apparently that comes out tomorrow.
*  And Rudy Giuliani is allegedly trying to fuck a 15 year old.
*  But it wasn't really a 15 year old.
*  She was in her 20s.
*  Playing a 15 year old.
*  Here goes Rudy Giuliani speaks out about on Borat 2 Controversy.
*  He calls it hit job over a Hunter Biden campaign.
*  How can it be a hit job over a Hunter Biden campaign if they shot it in July, bro?
*  There's no logic to it, right?
*  They're just trying to cover their ass.
*  I think they have to say that.
*  I want to know what the girl looked like.
*  Because they said she was playing a girl who was 15.
*  But I believe she's like 25 or something like that.
*  How old is the gal?
*  Oh, here's the...
*  Let's see what his hand does, pants.
*  Oh, Jesus Christ.
*  Looking for Hunter Biden's laptop in there somewhere.
*  I guess he was saying he was tucking it in his shirt.
*  Why would he do that?
*  Lying on the bed.
*  Imagine if that was him in your room lying on the bed.
*  You'd be like, hey man, what are you doing?
*  Unless, like you'd have to be a good friend.
*  Where they were so comfortable they could lie on their bed and adjust their balls.
*  But if you just met a person and you're lying on the bed with the hand on the Johnson.
*  Does he have sunglasses on too?
*  He looks like it.
*  He's on coke.
*  That's what I take.
*  He's probably smoking it.
*  Smoking coke.
*  He's on Viagra.
*  This girl's touching him too.
*  She's checking off his microphone.
*  Well, maybe he did have the wire tucked.
*  Because they do tuck them down your pants.
*  That is true.
*  I would like to see the film, the footage of it.
*  We're gonna. Tomorrow.
*  Tomorrow.
*  Because that's the only thing that does make sense in his defense.
*  Because sometimes they put those things down your pants and you do gotta get in there to get the wire out.
*  If he's taking the microphone off.
*  He could also.
*  I don't know, they just put mine back here, drop it down my jacket and put it on the back here.
*  I don't know why he's putting it in his pants.
*  True.
*  That's true too.
*  Yeah, why would you have it in the front?
*  He might have had it in the front pocket so he could sit down.
*  They often do that.
*  They'll put the mic in your front pocket as opposed to in your back.
*  The back area.
*  Because if you sit down on a chair that thing digs in your back.
*  I've had it in my front pocket before.
*  But the thing is like.
*  The gal.
*  See.
*  They're being pretty good about not showing her.
*  Yeah.
*  I want to know like did he know that she was supposed to be 15?
*  Or did he just think she was a girl?
*  Here's the thing.
*  If she is in her 20s.
*  And this is all speculation, right?
*  If she is in her 20s and she's beautiful.
*  The problem is he's gross and he's old.
*  And a beautiful girl, if she was, and we would have to see the footage.
*  But if she was being flirtatious.
*  Like he's helpless.
*  He's under a spell.
*  Nice.
*  Like an old fucked up looking dude like that.
*  If he thinks like oh my god this might.
*  Like that might be the last time.
*  I'm going to have a heart attack tonight.
*  Yeah.
*  A gal who's an attractive young gal.
*  Decides to fuck the famous lawyer.
*  A dude in his position has to know that that's coming.
*  Like that.
*  That a setup is coming?
*  A setup is coming.
*  Maybe not anymore.
*  Maybe he forgot.
*  Like he's old dude.
*  You know?
*  Yeah.
*  I mean you got to think.
*  Not only that but he's been under this tremendous stress of being a top lawyer.
*  For the most fucked up administration in the history of the United States.
*  So it's like the just the legal shit.
*  He's been battling back and forth.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a shit show.
*  It's a shit show.
*  His brain's probably hosed.
*  And he's probably in this hotel room going oh the universe is throwing me a bone.
*  Oh yes.
*  Yes it is.
*  Oh yes.
*  A big old bone.
*  Just not for you to chew on.
*  The hits never stop.
*  It just never stops.
*  There's like every time you think well the world's going to be normal today.
*  I mean we've gotten it all out of the way.
*  Nope.
*  Nope.
*  New thing.
*  The world is now spiking in the supposed cases of COVID.
*  Are they?
*  Yeah.
*  They were spiking for a while but it was young folks.
*  And it wasn't an issue.
*  It was like young folks were getting it but the deaths were very low.
*  You had a bad case right?
*  I didn't have a bad.
*  Yes and no.
*  A medium bad case.
*  So it was one of those.
*  You know I'm in Australia.
*  We went out to dinner.
*  My buddy Todd Fox and Chris.
*  And immediately food didn't taste right.
*  But this is all hindsight right?
*  I didn't know at the time.
*  We didn't know that these are the things you're looking for.
*  What month was this?
*  February.
*  February.
*  Oh this is early.
*  So nobody knew what to tell you.
*  I immediately was sick.
*  Then I had to get out on international flight the next morning.
*  Fly to New Zealand.
*  Oh you're a super spreader.
*  Yeah I'm a super spreader.
*  You brought it to New Zealand.
*  I brought it.
*  It was in me.
*  I'm going to put it in you.
*  So we got there.
*  I was like four days in the hotel.
*  Because we had four days off before the shows.
*  So I was just drinking water.
*  Hot showers.
*  Taking care of myself.
*  Hot tea.
*  Just trying to get through it.
*  And it sucked.
*  But it wasn't.
*  But you didn't know yet like how bad this thing could have been.
*  If I didn't know how bad it could have been I would have been freaking out.
*  Right you would have probably.
*  Yeah that's interesting right?
*  So we isolated pretty well.
*  I grabbed a mask before I even got on the plane.
*  Because I was just instinctually just having friends that are going to Taiwan.
*  And going to Japan.
*  You just see the mask.
*  I'm probably just going to wear the mask.
*  So this was pre-awareness of COVID?
*  No it was happening.
*  But you didn't connect the dots?
*  You didn't think you had COVID?
*  I asked the doctor when I got to New Zealand.
*  Do you think this is COVID?
*  He was like did you have a fever?
*  I'm like I don't remember if I had a fever.
*  Well then you didn't have COVID.
*  You don't have COVID.
*  Okay.
*  Doctors are cocky sometimes man.
*  Yeah so I got through that.
*  I was able to do the show.
*  I didn't close my throat down enough.
*  I would have to cancel.
*  Then the next shows were going to be in the Northwest.
*  How hard was it to sing?
*  It was not fun.
*  It was not fun.
*  We had to kind of adjust the set around a little bit.
*  Don't put the hard ones in.
*  I got to Hawaii to go train with Luis and some of the guys there.
*  Chad was a Muay Thai instructor.
*  I'm starting to do the Muay Thai and I'm like dude this hurts.
*  My hands have never hurt this bad.
*  I thought maybe I sprained them because right after I recovered in New Zealand,
*  I went trained in New Zealand thinking I'm just going to fucking gut it out.
*  I've got to walk it off, rub some dirt on it.
*  I felt okay then but when I finally got to Maui, I'm like this is not right.
*  This hurts.
*  I can't fucking do this.
*  I thought well maybe I sprained my wrist.
*  Months go by that they're not healing.
*  I'm going through harvest at this point and nothing's like they're not healing up.
*  Who's explained harvest?
*  Winery.
*  Winery yeah.
*  So getting into the grapes.
*  But I finally went to a doctor, arthritis doctor and he was like okay so walk me through when you first saw the da da da.
*  And I started walking him through everything.
*  He goes you had COVID and what some of the side effects that you find are that inflammation.
*  So whatever I guess.
*  So it's some kind of a rheumatoid response.
*  That alone would be well maybe I'm just 56 and I have arthritis but my blood work was completely clean everywhere else.
*  No other issues anywhere else in my body but just the wrists explaining that.
*  But I still have the cough.
*  So whatever cough I had, whatever cough I got in New Zealand like every other day I'll have a coughing fit for you know for 10 minutes.
*  Really?
*  Coughing up stuff so I have lung damage from it still.
*  Still?
*  Yeah.
*  Still every other day now?
*  Yeah.
*  Now when you train is your cardio diminished?
*  Yeah.
*  How much?
*  Enough to work and it's just my you know well A my motivation is diminished because I'm like trying to do stuff and my hands hurt.
*  Still?
*  Not anymore now that I'm on medication.
*  What medication did you put you on?
*  Methotrexate.
*  You're on meth?
*  Meth I'm smoking meth to get through it.
*  You look great.
*  Thank you.
*  I lost a lot of weight.
*  You know when you're on meth your heads they get sketchy.
*  It's much easier to push that second helping away now with the meth.
*  Right.
*  You get no appetite.
*  But no, methotrexate which is not fun to be on but my wrists have cleared up and now I'm back to you know doing stuff.
*  What is methotrexate normally?
*  It's like it's for rheumatoid arthritis but it's basically a chemotherapy.
*  Whoa.
*  Have you tried CBD?
*  I'm on CBD now.
*  Have you tried CBD without the methotrexoid stuff?
*  No.
*  No.
*  I've had a lot of friends with CBD.
*  The methotrexate goes for about it's like a you know I did I've done it for now 10 weeks.
*  I have another five weeks supposedly I'm gonna do but I'm gonna continue the CBD after that.
*  How much CBD are you taking a day?
*  A dropper.
*  Just one?
*  Yeah.
*  I'm taking I take a thousand milligrams a day.
*  It's a high dose but I find that.
*  How big is that?
*  It's a lot of droppers.
*  Okay.
*  It depends on I use CBD MD and I forget I think it's the 1300 milligram dropper.
*  I forget how many droppers I have to do it to hit a thousand a day but that seems to
*  be the magic number where I have it's kind of like turf toe but it's from kicking.
*  I have some some pretty intense pain sometimes in my big toe particularly after a hard heavy
*  back workout like yesterday I had a pretty bad.
*  But man I'll take the CBD and now today like I'm bending my toe right now on the ground
*  there's no pain at all.
*  Okay.
*  And it's it's amazing.
*  I fucking love it.
*  Okay.
*  I love it for so many I love it for anxiety.
*  I love it just for relaxation.
*  But I really love it for joint pain.
*  I think CBD is just I can't sing its praises enough.
*  I've had so many friends that have had like real joint problems like real pain and then
*  the CBD just completely takes it away.
*  I've had friends dog the dog was having a really hard time walking like walk with a
*  limp.
*  He gives the dog CBD and like two hours later the dog's like up and moving around and he's
*  like this is crazy.
*  Listening to chicken chow records.
*  Getting high.
*  Just chilling.
*  Dave Foley had pretty bad arthritis in his hands to the point where he couldn't straighten
*  his fingers out.
*  Got on CBD and now his hands are just mobile again.
*  Yeah.
*  Stuff's legit.
*  It's just that and adjusting the diet are the two main things.
*  That's what I noticed this fires up when I like I have more than a glass of wine and
*  some gluten in the in the dinner.
*  Yeah.
*  Then it flares up.
*  So there's it's connected.
*  That goddamn gluten.
*  There's something about it.
*  Have you but you your restaurant you use heirloom pasta though don't you.
*  We were.
*  I mean it's it's 50 50.
*  It's it's commercial flour with because we're finding that it's not holding up like your
*  expect pasta to hold up.
*  In what way.
*  And the texture.
*  Yeah.
*  Just texture doesn't hold.
*  So we're doing a blend of the heirloom along with commercial.
*  That's interesting.
*  It doesn't hold up.
*  But in Italy they use the heirloom wheat.
*  Right.
*  No.
*  Not necessarily.
*  Really.
*  They're getting a lot of Arizona.
*  There's a lot of Arizona wheat in the stuff you get from Italy.
*  Really.
*  Because the commodity that hard winter wheat that we grow is a great blender in.
*  And because they bring all the wheat they get it together and they send it to Italy.
*  They blend it.
*  They pick their their mix and they blend it.
*  So they actually sell our wheat back to us in the form of great Italian flour.
*  But it's actually grown in the United States.
*  That's interesting.
*  When I go over there even though he paused almost every day when I used to be able to
*  go over there I didn't get bloated.
*  But if I eat pasta here I just get thick.
*  Well there's so many other little things that are going on around it.
*  So you're probably over there you know for most for the average traveler you're in a
*  foreign country it's magical.
*  You're walking around more.
*  You know there's lots of stairs.
*  You're eating dinner probably earlier in the day or whatever.
*  But you're still walking around your activity.
*  Your activities are increased and the wines you're having are probably nice for quality
*  wines.
*  So all that stuff ends up being a better experience for you so your body's not reacting.
*  Over here you're like maybe I won't go for the walk.
*  Maybe I'll drink more than I should.
*  I like what you're saying but no not me.
*  All right.
*  Over here I work out like a fucking terrorist and over there I barely work out at all.
*  I'm getting hammered every day.
*  I'm eating until I literally can't stick another ravioli in my face.
*  No that's not what's going on.
*  I don't know what's going on.
*  I'm definitely walking around quite a bit you know but I work out.
*  I'm just always doing something here.
*  Yeah.
*  So and you know I don't know I don't know what the difference is honestly.
*  Because I had always thought it was an heirloom wheat and like there's a type of wheat you
*  would know this.
*  What is the zero zero like what is it?
*  Yeah Tee-Poo zero.
*  Tee-Poo zero zero.
*  So it's on the on the bag it actually says Tee-Poo T-I-P-O and then a zero zero and that's
*  a very fine ground white flour and you normally for pasta you're blending that with semolina
*  flour.
*  So it's usually about a two thirds to one third ratio.
*  And semolina is the Arizona hardy.
*  No no semolina is just another another version of what you know what you're you're putting
*  in that pasta to make those gluten stick together and so that's to give it like a bite so it
*  yeah chew to it.
*  Yeah.
*  Hmm.
*  Because there's a I don't remember the brand but I buy this particular spaghetti that's
*  just goddamn delicious and it's from Italy and it's that zero zero.
*  Okay.
*  Flour and it's just such a good pasta and that has a better effect on me than if I buy
*  like a standard American brand.
*  Well you know that if yeah so if you're if you're buying dry pasta in the states and
*  making your your food out of the dry pasta you probably have a lot better results if
*  you actually made your own fresh flour pasta.
*  Oh sure right.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah fresh pasta is the shit.
*  There's it's such a different taste right.
*  Yeah.
*  Like pasta is I like pasta period but fresh pasta like have you ever been to Felix in
*  Venice.
*  No.
*  Good Lord.
*  Next time you're there.
*  I brought you stuff.
*  What'd you bring?
*  I brought you stuff.
*  Felix in Venice.
*  We'll start here.
*  A must go to restaurant.
*  We're going to get to this other one in a minute but shout out to Janet and Evan.
*  You remember you heard me talk about Todd.
*  Yes.
*  So he just wrote this is another book he just wrote for it's like personal protection family
*  protection book.
*  Awesome.
*  We'll get to that in a minute.
*  Okay.
*  But I brought you.
*  You're kind of prepared.
*  Yeah.
*  You don't fuck around you have t-shirts.
*  Yeah.
*  That looks like a cooler.
*  Is that a cooler?
*  Yeah this is your cooler.
*  This is your t-shirts.
*  But I brought you our olives.
*  Ooh olives.
*  Couple wine glasses.
*  I realize at this studio we don't have your tarantula hawk.
*  That's at the old studio.
*  We must bring it back.
*  I'm leaving.
*  We will have it.
*  I'm just going to leave it.
*  Do not worry.
*  What is this?
*  What are these beverages?
*  Cider.
*  Is this alcoholic?
*  Yep.
*  I'm drinking it right now.
*  I know.
*  I have to wait.
*  It's November.
*  So sparkling cider, sparkling mead, sparkling white wine.
*  Sparkling mead.
*  Yeah.
*  Is it made with honey?
*  Yeah.
*  Whoa.
*  I've never had that.
*  Now you will.
*  What is that like?
*  I always read about that in the Conan books.
*  It's great.
*  It makes you want to crush your enemies.
*  Crush your enemies.
*  See them driven before you.
*  The lamentations of the women.
*  Of the women.
*  Yeah.
*  Damn.
*  These are for you.
*  Now are these things that you are making?
*  Yeah these are all Pusser for Wine.
*  Have you, when did you start doing that?
*  Beers and Meads.
*  A couple of years and a half ago.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  What was the motivation behind that?
*  I mean you were busy enough with your fucking wine.
*  Convenience.
*  And your food and your restaurants and your music and your three bands and your.
*  Right.
*  Jesus.
*  I got bored.
*  So I decided to take it up a notch.
*  Yeah.
*  You're a legit workaholic my friend.
*  Oh yeah.
*  So that's for you.
*  Thank you very much.
*  I'll leave it over here for you somewhere.
*  Fantastic.
*  I'm going to send a photograph when I'm drinking on November 1st.
*  Because this is for your marijuana cigarettes.
*  Oh dude.
*  You won't be able to fit your bongs in here.
*  I don't want to use the bongs anymore.
*  The bong, the long bong won't fit.
*  Oh that's a dope box though.
*  But this is for your marijuana cigarettes.
*  Or your mushrooms as it were.
*  That's a legit lunch box.
*  Yeah.
*  I had a lunch box, my last lunch box I had was in the.
*  Seventh grade?
*  Eighth grade?
*  Seventh grade or eighth grade I moved to a bad neighborhood.
*  And I realized you can't bring lunch boxes to school or kids get very upset with you.
*  So this is for you as well.
*  This is Todd's new book.
*  Protection for and from humanity.
*  And I'll let you read up on that.
*  For and from.
*  Yeah so he's the one that got me into doing the Muay Thai stuff.
*  And now for his book he's actually, this is kind of his promotional item he's doing with the book is.
*  Bucking gloves.
*  He's making his own gloves?
*  Yeah I'm having them made I'm sure.
*  Who makes these for him?
*  I don't know.
*  Find out.
*  Oh okay.
*  Nice.
*  You like these?
*  Yeah.
*  Now you've only been doing Muay Thai for how long now?
*  Not even a year.
*  And no problems with the hip?
*  Because you've.
*  No I mean.
*  You've replaced.
*  There's a weird shift that happens in the hip.
*  I got one of those little hammer thingies.
*  You know the little electric massager things.
*  Yeah.
*  So that's weird right?
*  No.
*  Those are good.
*  Theraguns.
*  Yeah so what happens is if I go a little too far what's happening is my hip joint kind of
*  just shifts forward a little bit and starts pinching something.
*  And I'll just stand on my left foot use that hammer on the hip.
*  Done.
*  We're fine.
*  You're a robot.
*  Get back to work.
*  You're kind of a cyborg now.
*  Kind of a cyborg.
*  A little bit.
*  Now did they give you a full hip replacement or is it just resurfacing?
*  Full hip.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah.
*  John Wayne Parr just got a hip resurfacing and there's videos of him 12 weeks after surgery
*  kicking the pads.
*  Now for.
*  They were telling me like I can't remember specifically but I want to say it was three
*  months before I actually got back on the mats.
*  They were like you're not going to want to do that for six months but you can probably
*  start getting back and doing some things in three months.
*  Just 12 weeks.
*  And of course nine weeks.
*  You kind of get a little itchy and you want to get out there and do stuff.
*  So yeah.
*  So you slowly moved around a little bit.
*  Yeah.
*  If you're doing just some basic positional drills and just doing that kind of stuff you're
*  fine.
*  But you know sparring is a you know.
*  Then you're.
*  Heavy loads.
*  Then you're being a dumb ass.
*  Yeah.
*  It's the one where they hack off the top of the hip bone.
*  They put a fake top and then they screw it deep into the bone.
*  And that kind of has to stay with you forever.
*  Yep.
*  But they can't really do that again right.
*  Nope.
*  That's it.
*  Yikes.
*  Done.
*  But I have a weapon so if something happens as long as I can balance on one foot.
*  You pull that out and beat it to death.
*  I can pull this thing out.
*  It's like a big blade in the middle of my bone and I can jam it into your juggler.
*  Right.
*  Like those canes that turn into a sword.
*  Yes.
*  Or umbrellas.
*  Don't recommend it.
*  The pain that you must have been in to agree to do that had to be pretty goddamn substantial.
*  Yeah.
*  Well the guy said like and it was a lot of stomping on stage that did it.
*  I pretty much damaged my right hip not my left because I did a lot of stomping with
*  my right foot.
*  Did you feel pain while you were stomping?
*  No.
*  It was like years later.
*  That's like a decade or more of doing that.
*  And then I just thought that I was being a wimp.
*  That I wasn't healing or I didn't push through it or whatever.
*  Or I wasn't working out enough.
*  They actually got in there like dude you have like a gob stopper for a hip.
*  So there's no padding.
*  There's nothing.
*  It's like a mangled chunk of pomace.
*  So all of the...
*  Gone.
*  Gone.
*  It was just like...
*  All the cartilage chewed up.
*  Gone.
*  Yeah.
*  There was no possible hope for stem cells or anything?
*  No.
*  They were like don't.
*  They just take that off the table.
*  It was like you've had this like this for seven years.
*  Minimum.
*  About the damage that was on the ball joint.
*  They were like this is...
*  We're surprised you weren't in here sooner.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  And were you limping at all when you were walking?
*  Yeah.
*  It was just all of a sudden fire off and I couldn't walk.
*  Because I remember you saying you were doing drills and you couldn't move your hip right
*  and you thought like you had like a hip impingement or something.
*  No.
*  It was just...
*  I didn't have a hip.
*  God.
*  Yeah.
*  Good times.
*  And then the hip impingement just got both of his knees replaced.
*  Ouch.
*  He's like 43 I believe.
*  Yeah.
*  I don't think he's much older than that.
*  But he's had some monsters kicking them so...
*  There's that but it's also running.
*  He runs a lot.
*  Okay yeah.
*  I ran in high school quite a bit.
*  And he runs on the concrete I believe.
*  I don't know where he runs but I know he's got a love of running.
*  They have concrete in a lot of places so it could be anywhere.
*  Could be.
*  It could be anywhere.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  And you know when you see a guy who's in his early 40s getting his knees completely replaced.
*  Yeah.
*  That's terrifying.
*  So what do you think went on with...
*  Is there something similar with bone structure and those kind of replacements that happened
*  with Anderson Silva's shin?
*  Or is it just like...
*  No.
*  He just checked.
*  Like when Weidman checked it he most likely cracked it on the first one and then the second
*  one he threw it again and just snapped it in half because...
*  But I mean after.
*  So after he healed and then he went back out and he started having some leg problems like
*  a year later even though it was healed.
*  Like it just wasn't healed enough or...
*  It takes a long time to heal a fracture like that.
*  When a bone snaps in half.
*  You remember Frank Mir when Frank Mir got hit by a car.
*  He was on his motorcycle.
*  He got hit by a car.
*  He was not the same for years.
*  He tried to fight again.
*  I think it was like a year and a half-ish later after the accident.
*  He wasn't the same.
*  So it took quite a long time for the old Frank...
*  And maybe you'd have to ask him.
*  Maybe he never really was the same again.
*  But just something about leg bones when they snap.
*  First of all you've got to think you can't put any weight on them for a long time.
*  So you've got all this atrophy.
*  So all the tissue around it atrophies.
*  And that's got to rebuild.
*  So you've got to rebuild that while you're also trying to make sure that the bone is
*  fully recovered and while you're pushing it who knows what kind of damage you're going
*  to do to the tendons and the ligaments.
*  It takes a long time unless you're doing some shit.
*  Unless you're on some steroids.
*  It takes a long time to build that muscle back up as well.
*  So there's a lot going on there.
*  Which is in a way it's not the opposite.
*  But for the hip replacement they had us walking within an hour.
*  Right just to make sure that as soon as you wake up they have you walking.
*  Yeah that is a weird...
*  Graham Hancock was in here.
*  Not here.
*  The other place.
*  Six weeks after hip replacement.
*  He was walking around and I was like that is...
*  You're walking like normal.
*  This is crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  They just make sure you start walking to make sure that you minimize the amount of atrophy.
*  Yeah.
*  I know Anderson got his knee blown out.
*  I think it was Jared Cannonier in that fight.
*  But Cannonier hit so fucking hard.
*  That could have happened at any point in time in his career.
*  You know.
*  It's amazing more guys don't have their knees blown out by leg kicks.
*  You know now doing Muay Thai.
*  If someone kicks your leg.
*  I'm sure...
*  I don't know.
*  Anthony Hardonk over at the...
*  That guy is terrifying.
*  Jesus dude.
*  We've got video of some dude going seriously just kick my leg.
*  I want to see what this is all about.
*  And Anthony is like you don't want that.
*  Seriously kick my leg.
*  It's like a guy crying.
*  He's on the ground crying.
*  And Anthony is like you can ask me to do that.
*  I don't know what you...
*  He's so big.
*  Hardonk was big for a heavyweight.
*  He's a thick fucking Dutchman.
*  Yeah.
*  Conk.
*  Yeah.
*  Those shins to the thigh.
*  It's one of the most underrated pains.
*  Yeah.
*  It's terrifying to ask a guy to do that.
*  I'm going to pursue that a little bit.
*  I'm not going to ever use it for anything.
*  But I just like that next level of awareness.
*  Striking awareness?
*  Yeah.
*  But the one thing I haven't done is I haven't gotten with an instructor to go just teach
*  me how to not get hit.
*  Just that awareness of seeing what's coming and starting to understand the sequence of
*  events that are going to lead up to that strike.
*  Then you have of course in the UFC you have unconventional strikers that are going to
*  come at you from angles you didn't expect.
*  But in general.
*  And not really because I want to get in a fight.
*  Just because I want to have that extra part of my brain exercised just to action reaction.
*  I know it's funny.
*  Like if you say I want to learn how to play piano.
*  Someone doesn't say what are you going to play in concerts?
*  They don't say that.
*  But if you say I want to learn Muay Thai.
*  Oh, you're going to fight?
*  Yeah.
*  Tomorrow.
*  I like to learn it.
*  It's a skill.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like you know I'd like to learn how to do a back handspring.
*  I'd like to learn how to do a lot of things.
*  Right.
*  Just seems like a cool thing to learn.
*  But that's one of those things if you even say you want to learn it.
*  People are like why do you want to learn that?
*  Are you going to fight people?
*  Right.
*  Like no it's an interesting thing.
*  First of all it's cool.
*  Right.
*  You know.
*  And it's an interesting thing to know.
*  So your coach doesn't work with you on defense?
*  I don't really have a coach.
*  You don't?
*  Because it was just Todd was kind of he and I were the ones going around the world and
*  training with insane instructors.
*  Really good coaches.
*  So you get.
*  Oh so he's a practitioner but he's not a coach.
*  Well Todd's a black belt under Rodrigo Faji for Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.
*  But he and I caught the bug.
*  Well he caught the bug before I caught the bug.
*  He made me catch the bug.
*  So you know with his connections traveling all the time as he did he would have insane
*  instructors and then this instructor would introduce you to that instructor when you
*  go into that town.
*  So we had great.
*  You know it was really cool to meet these people.
*  But the problem that I was having was when you're trying to have Carlos Condit teach
*  you how to do something he's like four feet taller than I am.
*  And like it doesn't what he does isn't necessarily going to translate to me.
*  So you could see him struggling to go how do I explain this to you as a midget.
*  Like how do you how do I how to make this work for you.
*  Because it works for me because I have length and I have an entire history of being.
*  Well a lot of the ties are very short.
*  You know. Yeah. So that's why I love when you get to like someplace like New Zealand it
*  has short people beating fuckers up.
*  That's great. So you know they're in there my height.
*  So I got a lot more out of out of that stuff in in Australia New Zealand.
*  Have you been to Thailand. No have not yet been.
*  That would be a move. Once everything opens up go there and do some training there.
*  There's a lot of people that go to Phuket because they have it set up where you know you
*  could stay there you could train there.
*  And one of my business managers went there he spent six days there just just doing
*  nothing but training and just enjoying it.
*  Going there and working out with like real Thai coaches every day.
*  They barely speak English. They've had 300 fights and they'll show you how to do everything.
*  Old school Thai you know classic Muay Thai stance.
*  I think we did that in Copenhagen. We went to an awesome gym there.
*  This guy barely spoke English but he's he was he could still instruct you because you know he's
*  pointing and grunting.
*  Yeah well also you mirror you know you see how they do it.
*  You know they'll say look look look and then they'll do it.
*  You're like OK. Right.
*  But you feel so dumb when you when you watch someone who's like really good at Muay Thai like
*  this it's so effortless you know that it's so graceful.
*  It's a really interesting art form you know because there's really only a few kicks like they
*  just got it down to mostly roundhouse kicks a couple of side kicks teeps you know front kicks.
*  And that's about it. Everything else is like they unless they're going to do a cartwheel kick or some
*  San Chai shit.
*  They're learning that from other people or just playing around having fun.
*  But the art itself when it comes down to the kicking but because they have that they've got it down to
*  like this smoothness and the efficiency.
*  Yeah the part that's really eluded me is that because I don't have enough hours in doing it I don't
*  really have the like you know French had the liaison of this words kind of slides into that.
*  That transition of understanding you're not going to you can't throw that kick because you didn't do
*  the thing before that set you up in the position to be in a position to throw that kick.
*  Right.
*  So that kind of stuff is very interesting and complicated and in a way kind of just I stop.
*  I'm like I'm in my head too much going like wait a minute.
*  I always equate it to like a vocabulary.
*  You talk to someone who's very articulate they have a lot of words at their disposal.
*  They have a lot they have a deep understanding of how the language works.
*  Whereas if you talk to a child they can say some things but it's kind of crude and that's how most
*  people are when it comes to martial arts.
*  You're in the beginning in particular you're basically like a child.
*  You're crude clumsy with your words.
*  Whereas you talk to a master you know someone like a bull cow or something like that.
*  And like there's the fluency the fluidity the efficiency of the movements.
*  It's just such a beautiful thing to watch.
*  Yeah.
*  Always in the right position you know like one of my favorites for sure.
*  Have you ever watched Giorgio Petrosian fight.
*  No.
*  Oh my God you got to watch that guy fight.
*  He is the doctor.
*  God's always it was always sending me videos of do you got to watch this guy fight.
*  So he most likely has sent me videos of Petrosian at one point in time when he was 23 I think he was 43 and 0.
*  And like some 35 knockouts or something like that by the time he was 23 he'd beaten a shitload of world
*  Muay Thai champions.
*  And if you have a UFC fight pass UFC fight pass is great because it has not just UFC fights but it has a
*  shitload of other promotions including it's showtime.
*  It's showtime goes way back to like the early 2000s like 20 years ago and it's showtime was the precursor to glory.
*  OK.
*  I am wearing a glory shirt.
*  Hey hey hey.
*  And glory is like the premier kickboxing event of today.
*  Right.
*  So Petrosian I think still fights for glory.
*  But Petrosian when he was in his 20s you could catch those on UFC fight pass.
*  I just was watching it yesterday in the gym.
*  I was watching him when he was 23 and it's probably like probably deep in his 30s now I think it's probably 37 or something like that.
*  But he's been around forever and he is just one of the smoothest most elegant fighters to watch but ruthlessly effective.
*  But his technique is just perfect.
*  He's always in a perfect position and he's a guy if you watch him train constantly drilling just drill drill drill over and over and over again and you know they'll do situational drills and positional drills.
*  And so his footwork and everything is all second nature.
*  Like when the guy comes to him he steps aside left hook right kick and like all these techniques that that flow together so perfectly in a match.
*  You could watch him rehearse them over and there's a ton of videos on YouTube and watch him watch him train.
*  But they call him the doctor because like literally like he it's like he's doing something different than all these other guys are doing.
*  And when you're talking like world champions and he was KO in them when he was in his early 20s.
*  Wild to watch just because it's like what is he doing different.
*  Like it's hard to see.
*  Like if you watch Mike Tyson in his prime it's pretty obvious what he's doing different.
*  You know you watch Roy Jones Jr.
*  in his prime pretty obvious faster than everybody ridiculous left hook you're seeing it all with Georgio it's like how is he able to do this to these guys like his understanding of position of when to be there and when to not be there.
*  It's just second to none.
*  So and I so you know the transition we're talking you know that's kind of the part that's always eluded even even with your jiu jitsu like those in-betweens and when you kind of lose the fight like the match kind of loses so.
*  You know we get we ended up here so Ortega this last fight that Ortega did I felt like the thing that really was like surprising to me was not necessarily that he's like oh now you've trained striking and you're doing really well at the striking it was like those in-between things that he was doing that I was like yes I've never I haven't seen that in most UFC fighters like just that in-between thing that he put the glue together to.
*  He wasn't leaving any holes.
*  There's no holes.
*  Yeah no holes.
*  Yeah it was brilliant it was a masterful performance because that guy the Korean Zombie Chan Sung Jung is very tough.
*  He's dangerous.
*  Very dangerous and Brian neutralized him he neutralized everything and he looked so smooth and professional like everything he was doing looked so good and the Korean Zombie said he doesn't remember anything of the last three rounds doesn't remember them because remember he got hit with that back spin elbow.
*  Yeah.
*  He got KO'd and apparently he was just on autopilot for the rest of the fight doesn't remember he says he's very embarrassed doesn't even remember the fight.
*  Wow.
*  Yeah that happens sometimes guys get KO'd and they'll go back to their corner they're like is it the second round it's the fifth round.
*  And like it is.
*  Yeah it's the fifth round.
*  Come on man you're losing the fight like I am.
*  Right.
*  I thought it just started like they literally don't remember fights and it's because they're they're literally concussed.
*  You get bumped.
*  While they're inside the ring.
*  Luckily there's no you know when we're doing shows I'm not getting bonked so if you lose track of the show and you don't know what song you're on.
*  Does that ever happen?
*  That's actually a good thing because you're like you're in you're in the zone.
*  Right.
*  And you're actually like you've kind of disappeared into that story you wrote you're no longer thinking about the story you wrote you're just you're now just delivering the story unconsciously but consciously.
*  Or you dipped into that Pussy for Lunch box and got some of that good shit.
*  The marijuana cigarette.
*  Woo!
*  That will do it.
*  There's been many a show where I'm in the middle of a bit going what bit is this?
*  Yeah.
*  He generally just takes a second like oh yeah airplane airplane.
*  Yeah.
*  Keep talking keep talking you're good.
*  But the the shows that you do have you ever been in a situation where you're in the middle of a song and you are you're so in the groove that you kind of forget what song it is?
*  Don't know where I am.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  Because you're so in it you're in the middle of it but then you make that mistake of thinking about it.
*  Or having a memory of like oh like a week ago I fucked this song up and as soon as you have that thought you're like pew!
*  Isn't that interesting about live performances?
*  Yeah.
*  Well that's kind of why you know that's kind of why you do those.
*  Yeah.
*  So this thing we got coming up is not it's a we already recorded it.
*  We filmed it at Arcosante.
*  What is Arcosante?
*  Arcosante is that is this insane concrete village that was I'm gonna get his name wrong.
*  Apollo Soleri.
*  Look that up buddy.
*  Apollo Soleri.
*  Apollo.
*  He was a student of Frank Lloyd Wright.
*  So he built his foundry in the middle of the desert on your way up to Flagstaff from Phoenix.
*  It's kind of off the 17.
*  And it's.
*  For what purpose?
*  For bells.
*  They make these kind of bell structures and they make you know so there's a kind of a school to you can go attend to understand how to do foundry work but also concrete.
*  Just understand these concrete structures.
*  And so it's all these locations and there's there's kind of a school there there's there's people that come come through and travel.
*  There you go Soleri.
*  Is there an image of this place?
*  Look up Arcosante.
*  Arcosante.
*  How do you spell that?
*  A-R-C-O.
*  S-A-N-T-I.
*  How did you find out about this place?
*  It's right near my house.
*  It's like an hour away.
*  Whoa.
*  How fucking cool is that spot?
*  Holy shit man.
*  Yeah.
*  That's all concrete?
*  Yeah.
*  Fuck.
*  So you know the added pressure like when you're playing live it's just a live show there's pressure because you know you're playing live but there's not a lot of pressure because when it goes by the next song don't worry about it.
*  But when you're playing live in front of a camera and it's going to capture you fucking up.
*  That's a lot of pressure.
*  So we filmed a couple like two weeks ago we filmed the entire album.
*  We did all the songs in these in these structures.
*  And did you have an outdoor audience?
*  No.
*  No audience for it because we had to do it.
*  We were doing it like mostly at night like early rising late rising.
*  It was quite it was not easy to do especially in this thing supposed to be kind of this integrated with the natural terrain.
*  So you've got you've got rattlesnakes and shit everywhere like it's your you're living in the desert.
*  Your your 360 views are the wilderness the hostile environment.
*  So and no audience and then you're saying no audience is singing so but it's also hot.
*  It's also cold.
*  It's also like your there's like there's black widows and you know so you're you know it's kind of a not an easy thing to do especially when you're trying to catch the sunrise and you want the song to land right on as the sun's coming up over the horizon.
*  Like all those kind of things that that and it's like fucking 6 a.m.
*  You're like fuck.
*  So you were recording as the sun was coming up trying.
*  Yeah. On song one song.
*  But like then you're you're trying to catch other things with the stars on the other songs and it's all timing and you know am I going to get bit.
*  That sounds amazing.
*  Fucking tired and I'm sure it sucked while you were doing that and getting up.
*  But the overall product.
*  Yeah I'm pretty I'm pretty stoked about it and that's what that's what we're doing is that's a that's that's streaming on the same day that the album comes out on the 30th.
*  And what's it streaming on.
*  I don't know what the actual service it is but it's post for live dot com is where you go to get a ticket to see it.
*  And I think it's the same one that did.
*  I want to say it's the it's the same service that Mr. Bungle is doing I think Mr. Bungle shows the day after ours.
*  So it's the same service and.
*  But it's available on the post for website.
*  No it's post for live dot com.
*  It's a separate website.
*  Is there a link to it on post for dot com.
*  There should be on the main page but if you just go to post for post for live dot com that's where it takes you there.
*  What's for performing the new album and its entirety from our costante in the Arizona desert.
*  Dude that is such a great idea.
*  I love it.
*  Well you know this whole lockdown thing not being able to tour.
*  This is our tour.
*  This is it.
*  So.
*  Yeah it's been a weird one right.
*  And the fact that everybody was like oh you know around June we'll probably be fine.
*  Here it is November almost.
*  Yeah and I think the big thing like you know kind of circling back is I'm still feeling residual effects of that thing and I feel like there's a bunch of people that that maybe I didn't almost die.
*  I have friends who almost died.
*  Yeah I do as well.
*  It was ugly.
*  So and then you have people going you guys are apparently I'm being paid to say this.
*  Eat a dick dude.
*  Oh you can't pay attention to those people.
*  Those those are people think that 5G is killing babies.
*  People are out of their fucking minds.
*  There's so much noise out there.
*  It's so hard.
*  It's so hard to pay attention.
*  It's so it's so hard to try to separate.
*  I have two friends that came real close to dying and then I have other friends that shook it off like it was nothing.
*  I have a couple of friends that didn't even know they had it.
*  They tested positive.
*  They said I didn't feel a thing.
*  Jamie was sick for a day and he was convinced it was ragweed.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah but my friend Michael Yo he came really close.
*  He was in the hospital for quite a long time and my friend Dr. Neil Reardon he was in the hospital.
*  It came very close to death a couple of times and he you know I think folks that got it early on before they knew how to treat it correctly and what was going on and what do they got their asses handed to them.
*  Yeah for sure.
*  Yeah our friend Dean his family and I'm going to get this wrong so I'm sure Dean's going to light me up but I think his wife tested positive.
*  The kids tested positive.
*  He tested positive.
*  I think the parents tested positive.
*  Then nobody showed any symptoms.
*  He showed symptoms on a Tuesday.
*  Finally got into the hospital almost died on a Sunday then recovered quickly after because he's in shape.
*  He's like mid 40s.
*  He does.
*  He's a runner.
*  He's not out of shape.
*  But like there was a touch and go moment where he couldn't speak to you couldn't talk to you on Sunday like that.
*  So on a Tuesday showed symptoms you know not fucking cool at all on a Sunday and then came out of it.
*  So meanwhile Fatso Trump 74 years old eating french fries kicks it in the weekend back on the campaign trail.
*  Yeah.
*  Looks a hundred times better than Biden.
*  They got him on steroids and Adderall.
*  He looks great.
*  He looks great.
*  I'm thinking about trying Adderall now.
*  He looks so good.
*  It's amazing.
*  I saw him give a speech the other day.
*  I'm like the guy has never looked better.
*  Like COVID like literally like he had a hermetic effect.
*  Yeah.
*  And his body is actually stronger because of COVID.
*  Still a douche bag.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Probably more.
*  Because now he thinks he's immune.
*  Cocky douche bag.
*  Doesn't have to worry anymore.
*  Yeah.
*  You know now he can go just have people spit in his mouth.
*  Please.
*  And he's fine.
*  It's so weird.
*  Please do.
*  The world doesn't seem real.
*  You know it just it seems like you have to remind yourself.
*  OK.
*  This is still real.
*  This is the world.
*  Yeah.
*  You know.
*  But I think that's kind of what you know you had those good you had those good aunts those good uncles good friends when you were a kid that you kind of learn there's a lot of influence you get from your parents.
*  You know my dad is you know my whole world as far as influence a good influence on decision making right.
*  But you also have those people around you that you should have around you if they're positive.
*  That it should be fairly easy to see right through bullshit and get to the core of a good decision.
*  It should.
*  It should.
*  But now with this fucking thing.
*  The phones.
*  It's very strange to think to the information you're getting to make that decision has been picked apart and it's all dopamine dump.
*  Yeah.
*  Charged.
*  So you can't really.
*  It's sensationalized.
*  Conversations start with an argument.
*  Mm hmm.
*  I really like I really like Frosted Flakes and if you don't like Frosted Flakes fuck you.
*  You must be racist.
*  Yeah you must be racist.
*  You must be a faggot.
*  Yeah.
*  I had Alan Levinovitz on the podcast and he had a really he's actually working on a book about this now.
*  But it was a series of tweets that he put up about what we're dealing with with social media.
*  There's the same thing that we're dealing with with processed food processed food with all these preservatives.
*  It fills you up it's terrible for you.
*  He's like this is processed information.
*  This is not how human beings are supposed to process exchange information.
*  You're not supposed to get it in this 280 character form.
*  It should be a faceless.
*  It should be a process you go through to digest the information.
*  Well it should be people are supposed to talk like this.
*  This is one of the things that people love about podcasting.
*  It is a digital thing and you're getting it and it's kind of impersonal in a way.
*  But it's also kind of personal because you and I are having a personal moment and it's recorded.
*  Like we're in front of each other we're looking at each other and this is how people are.
*  And we're nice to each other.
*  And you say something and I consider it.
*  We talk and you get in real time to exchange information back and forth and see how the other person responds to it.
*  And then respond to their response.
*  That's how people are supposed to talk man.
*  And this Twitter thing that people are doing the most mentally ill people I know spend the most time on Twitter.
*  And they're on it ranting and raving and blaming all these other people for their unhappiness.
*  And it's so weird to see.
*  So it's like you're watching people self, they're self-inflicting themselves with venom.
*  Yeah. That's why I kind of like what's you know one of the things that I noticed when I got into the wine industry is that you have all these different walks of life.
*  Various political bents, various religious bents, you know just various cultures all kind of coming together in this thing.
*  And I don't have in my circle of people, I can talk.
*  We can all talk to each other.
*  And all of those cultures are represented.
*  All those political beliefs, all those religious beliefs, all those things are all represented in all the people that we deal with.
*  And we have these civil conversations with each other face to face.
*  We're all busting our asses.
*  We're all doing a thing.
*  There's a puzzle we're trying to solve.
*  There's a problem we've encountered that I don't know how to solve and you know how to solve it.
*  I'm trying to build this thing and you're very good at building this thing.
*  We're solving puzzles.
*  You have a core common ground.
*  Yeah, yeah. We have a core common ground from just from life.
*  We're just we're making a living.
*  You have a living and we're just talking.
*  We're talking.
*  As soon as you go here and when you're anonymous it turns into this fucking ugly fight of polarized mess of like you have to pick a side and it's like.
*  Yeah, you're on the wrong side of the street.
*  And like there's the only thing we're really kind of massaging and trying to work around and picking a side on is weather is Mother Nature.
*  You're just trying to she smacks the shit out of you and you're trying to fucking navigate it.
*  And so that she's in charge and you are not in charge.
*  And so that's the thing about having a common having a common thing that you do like jujitsu.
*  Like if you train jujitsu you're going to have Republicans and Democrats and progressives and and libertarians.
*  They're all going to be training together and you know they'll laugh and smile at disagreements they have because the agreement they have is that jujitsu is awesome.
*  Right. So they're in there trying to choke each other and and then the other stuff is like I can choke you if I don't agree with you I can just disagree with it.
*  Then I get to choke you.
*  But it's just it's not as important as the jujitsu.
*  You know it's like somewhere along the line it became like you have to be on my side or fuck you.
*  And that these ideological echo bubbles that people these chambers that people get into it's just it's never before happened where you've had people that can so readily find people that agree with them wholeheartedly and have full confirmation bias like only only people that are on this side.
*  And this that believe these things and this core group and it's real obvious like it's it's real cut and dry what they believe and what they want what they see and what they don't.
*  And then it's reinforced by CNN and MSNBC and Fox News and you know all these biased news sources.
*  If there is a division I guess that I would make it would be fundamentalism versus fucking chill out ism.
*  I don't know.
*  It's because people are so you're you're you're far left and you're far right or bumping each other's asses on the other side of the circle.
*  They're the same.
*  They're they're they're all one fucking stroke away from Handmaid's Tale and they are burning books together.
*  Yeah.
*  Telling you what pronouns to use and what religion you're supposed to pick and write all this stuff.
*  It's they're the same person.
*  They're the same people.
*  And we're in the middle going I I just want some pasta.
*  It's super simple super similar and it's all coming together with this pandemic because people are being forced to be locked away.
*  You're locking away.
*  You're staying away from people.
*  So you have less interaction less actual real contact with people more digital contact more processed bullshit way of communicating with people.
*  And then there's the fear and then there's the lack of money because everybody's out of work.
*  And then there's all this panic that comes with that and this anger and anxiety and existential angst of the disease itself and the combination of all these factors together with a fucking douchebag for a president chaos and and no good choices for opponents.
*  You know everybody's just voting the people that are not voting for Trump.
*  They're just voting for not Trump.
*  They're not voting for Joe Biden like no one's super excited about Joe Biden.
*  They're voting for not Trump.
*  So you sit in there like if you're an observer watching this like we got to get out of here like this.
*  This is going to blow.
*  I think you start to default back to the position of OK well this I'm just to step back and just see in my lifetime what what haven't we seen.
*  OK well in my lifetime we haven't seen a female black president.
*  So if you're voting for Biden in a way you have to be a little honest about it.
*  You're actually voting for Kamala Harris because it's very possible she's going to be the next president.
*  Possible.
*  100 percent.
*  But is she an awful person is she a bad person is she a good person.
*  I don't know.
*  I just know that it's a step forward.
*  It's something that hasn't happened before me and I get to be alive when we've when we have a female president.
*  Well we've never had a Nazi president either.
*  Right.
*  Is that a step forward.
*  Well we already have that.
*  Oh I don't think he's a Nazi.
*  He's got a Jewish son-in-law.
*  His son-in-law though is the Antichrist.
*  Have you ever seen him next to Damien.
*  Have you ever seen.
*  That's great.
*  From the movie.
*  We've done it multiple times.
*  Come on put it up there.
*  Him and Damien from the movie Damien the Omen.
*  You look at the two of them together like oh there he is.
*  He's the Antichrist.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  So it's not like the devil's son's devil son-in-law.
*  Son in law.
*  That's what it is.
*  I like it.
*  Well maybe he's the devil son and Trump's son-in-law.
*  Yeah maybe he's got like there's a he's got the handle.
*  Maybe he's just a nice guy with great hair and a beautiful suit.
*  And you're just making it up.
*  Yeah maybe he's just got really good bone structure and I'm jealous.
*  Could be that.
*  And a beautiful wife that happens to be Trump's daughter.
*  Maybe that.
*  Maybe I'm just a bitch.
*  Could be that.
*  But so.
*  You see a photo.
*  You got a picture of him.
*  Look at the two of them side next to each other.
*  Damien the Omen.
*  The Omen.
*  God damn it Brian.
*  You're not that young.
*  You should know who the fuck.
*  How old are you man?
*  46.
*  You should fucking know who the Omen is bro.
*  Oh yeah look at right there.
*  The fifth photo over.
*  Yeah just say that's some.
*  Yeah come on son.
*  He's actually right now not looking at the camera.
*  He's talking to the wolves across the fence.
*  Right.
*  On the other side.
*  They're just making eye contact.
*  Yeah.
*  Delivering a message.
*  That literally is straight out of the Omen.
*  Yeah.
*  Damien the Omen.
*  Jared Kushner.
*  Google those two things together and go to images.
*  I've seen it.
*  We've pulled it up multiple times on this podcast.
*  It's 100 percent accurate.
*  Jared Kushman.
*  Here watch this.
*  I just felt Kushman.
*  Images.
*  There you go.
*  You can do there.
*  You can watch this.
*  Nope.
*  Who's that guy?
*  Well he's famous now.
*  Is it Kushner right?
*  Yeah.
*  We were.
*  Yeah.
*  There's got to be an image of.
*  Right there.
*  Where?
*  Down.
*  Oh yeah down on the bottom.
*  Yeah look come on son.
*  I mean that's the Omen.
*  That's him.
*  That is him.
*  Now go back to the images again and there's one with him.
*  It's like a portrait mode with up there right where you're right above that one right above that one.
*  Yeah click on that.
*  So look at Trump is blurry and look at him.
*  The devil.
*  He's got his hand right up his puppet ass.
*  He's like making him say the Satan thing.
*  We are so close.
*  So close.
*  So close to the final confrontation.
*  Maybe I'm just being a bitch.
*  Order some goats blood on Amazon.
*  A really handsome man with a slender neck.
*  A beautiful wife.
*  Maybe I should just shut the fuck up.
*  Maybe maybe it's me man.
*  It's probably you.
*  Probably you.
*  No matter who gets in that office they get skewered.
*  Yeah.
*  I was interested to see what they say about Bernie.
*  I was really hoping we could see what would happen if that guy would get in place.
*  That was that was interesting to me.
*  What would happen if somebody got in place and said you know what we're going to make college free.
*  We're going to completely absolve you of student debt.
*  We're going to make Medicare for all.
*  We're going to make a lot of money.
*  We're going to make Medicare for all.
*  We're going to raise the minimum wage to fifteen dollars an hour.
*  All those things that are.
*  I'm not an economist.
*  Maybe it wouldn't have worked.
*  But I was interested to see.
*  I'm like that seems like to be a good use of taxpayer money.
*  Like if you're going to use taxpayer money and most of them are using it for.
*  Well the problem now it is if you want if you want to know that scenario you don't have anybody who's going to go OK.
*  Let's honestly look at it and we're going to present the case for or for against.
*  In the middle like what the possibilities might be.
*  You don't have anybody that's going to actually be loud enough to tell you the answer that you're that you're.
*  Yeah it was only Bernie.
*  But as far as like actually somebody breaking it down because if you try to Google that what is that information.
*  All this shit's going to be in the way talking about you know socialism and whatever.
*  So you don't know.
*  And I and I'm not necessarily for Bernie.
*  I'm just saying I don't know because I can't find the the paper that isn't biased to present that argument to me.
*  Well to me it was pretty shocking that the only people that I was interested at all were blocked out by the system.
*  Tulsi Gabbard Bernie Sanders Andrew Yang was the only people I was interested in.
*  And they were completely blackballed and pushed out by the system.
*  They're like fuck you.
*  Fuck you.
*  So then you know so follow you know normally when you're to find something out about a history of a place you kind of follow the money to release records.
*  So follow follow the follow the reason you know why were they.
*  So who's who's blocking them out and why would they be blocking them out and follow that and follow that breadcrumb trail to see why.
*  I just want it to be over.
*  Yeah.
*  And I want civil war to be here already so I know how many bullets to buy.
*  That's like Tuesday.
*  It seems like it's coming.
*  Yeah.
*  Seems like it's coming.
*  But I feel like this is a good place to be.
*  First of all this is a very neutral ground because it's a blue spot in a red state.
*  It really is.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  And a red room.
*  Yeah.
*  Arizona is it seems like it's well and on paper and you never know the polls don't mean shit.
*  But you know they're saying Biden's ahead in Arizona.
*  How is that possible.
*  I don't know.
*  But that's a red state because where I'm where I live like that's all day long you've got to do like with the Trump flag driving around in the car.
*  And it's like I can we just have a coffee.
*  Can we just talk.
*  No.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Fuck yeah.
*  Fuck you.
*  Hunk for freedom.
*  It's just it's what can we just.
*  How can we not honking.
*  Yeah.
*  And then you're in a fight because you didn't honk like you didn't even fucking honk for freedom.
*  Too busy sucking cock.
*  Yeah.
*  Like for for enslavement.
*  I suck cock for enslavement.
*  I'm into it.
*  Some people are into that.
*  They want you to tie them up.
*  Now what are you going to do.
*  It's it's it's a confusing time too because a lot of these states that were read are getting infiltrated by people like me that are abandoning the blue states.
*  They're abandoning California.
*  But taking the blue states to the red states.
*  Yeah.
*  They're like I'm going to go to this place with freedom and then just take it all away.
*  Yeah.
*  You don't need that many guns.
*  And what are you going to do.
*  Do whatever you want.
*  That doesn't seem right.
*  We need some regulation.
*  And then yeah.
*  It all becomes California.
*  And then you know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  I don't know.
*  It all becomes California.
*  Yeah.
*  That's like you know there are things in.
*  It is funny the business that I'm in.
*  They're in the alcohol business.
*  It's almost it's completely contrary to what you would think about the people who like
*  less government less regulation less all those things like the one that comes to wine and
*  and you know that kind of thing in Arizona.
*  It's the it's very California.
*  They're like they want to control everything you're doing.
*  They want to know every move you're making.
*  There's all these hoops you got to jump through to get things done.
*  It's it's funny.
*  How so?
*  In what way?
*  Just just in the regulation of alcohol and how they interpret you know they're very.
*  That's Arizona in general.
*  Yeah.
*  And specific brother.
*  Yeah.
*  For the winemaking there's a lot of hoops we have to jump through as winemakers.
*  Come on here in Texas bro.
*  You can make wine with a gun.
*  They don't give a fuck.
*  Fredericksburg.
*  Right out here man.
*  Not far from here.
*  Yeah.
*  They have great wine.
*  Yeah.
*  Allegedly.
*  I like your wine.
*  Yeah.
*  I know it tastes good.
*  You're gonna like more of my wine.
*  Oh shit.
*  I like your first.
*  I like your wine.
*  I just don't know why I like it.
*  You know have you seen sour grapes?
*  Because it's made with love.
*  That too.
*  Have you seen sour grapes?
*  The documentary?
*  No.
*  Yes.
*  Parts of it.
*  I haven't seen the whole.
*  I haven't.
*  It's pretty amazing.
*  That's what I keep hearing.
*  It's amazing.
*  Yeah.
*  That this guy made fake wine that was supposed to be these really expensive bottles and duped
*  all these like real one.
*  Jesus.
*  Well so when I first heard about the film I was under the impression like that I sat
*  next to that guy.
*  I was at a Australian consulate wine dinner in Beverly Hills with Peter Gago from Penfold
*  sitting next to me and that guy was sitting next to me.
*  What is that guy's name?
*  Sour grapes.
*  Sour grapes.
*  The documentary.
*  Ruby?
*  Ruby.
*  Yeah.
*  So he, I met that guy.
*  I sat next to him.
*  I didn't buy any wine from him.
*  Luckily.
*  But you know I met him.
*  You bought some Walmart wine.
*  So initially I was like you know fuck that guy for like duping all these people but the
*  thing that they're basically saying was that yeah that aside yeah he fucked a lot of people
*  up but his ability to do what he was doing to put these wines in bottle and mimic what
*  the nature, the color, everything about it and being able to duplicate what's in the
*  bottle to the point where it would fool Assam.
*  He was like he's an alchemist.
*  Like he was really good at like making it.
*  He wasn't just like putting wine in a bottle and selling you the bottle.
*  Like if you opened it and you tasted it.
*  You really thought it was that wine.
*  You would go that seems like a that seems like not a great version of that wine but
*  that's that wine.
*  Oh so you could tell that it was slightly off.
*  In some cases that's that's you know.
*  Did you try any of this wine?
*  No.
*  No.
*  God I would want to try it.
*  But like they were just saying the guy really was able to get close to mimicking the palates
*  and structure of these wines.
*  So that's why.
*  What's his name again Brian?
*  Rudy Kumul Yuma.
*  How do you say it?
*  Ruby.
*  Kurnawan.
*  It's right here.
*  Kurnawan.
*  Kurnawan.
*  Kurnawan.
*  Kurnawan.
*  Kurnawan.
*  Kurnawan.
*  Kurnawan.
*  Kurnawan.
*  Kurnawan.
*  Kurnawan.
*  Kurnawan.
*  Kurnawan.
*  Rudy Kurnawan.
*  Okay.
*  Rudy.
*  Interesting.
*  So how did this guy do this?
*  Like if you.
*  No idea.
*  If it's such a fine art to create a great wine and I know you I've tried multiple different
*  wines from you.
*  Well the thing is what he was doing you know and I'm just I'm speculating on this I haven't
*  seen the film but what he was doing was just to fool you right now.
*  That wine might not last.
*  In that bottle once.
*  Oh.
*  It's not going to hold up.
*  It's not the structure.
*  It's not the structure of wine.
*  I mean he was literally putting dirt and things in to create that initial impression so that
*  when you taste it to investigate it you know okay I think that's what that is and then
*  he write the check and he's like bitch.
*  There is a fucking great book that I am in the middle of that you would love that's based
*  on the history of the wine.
*  You're going to read this one next right.
*  Yes I'll read that one.
*  It's my friend Graham Hancock wrote the forward to it and then it's a Brian Murrow rescues
*  book and here we find it's in my library here.
*  It's called the immortality key and whoops and it is all about ancient wine and the ancient
*  Greeks and the ancient Greeks and the ancient Greeks and the ancient Greeks and the ancient
*  Greeks and the ancient Greeks and the ancient Greeks and the ancient Greeks and the ancient
*  wine and the ancient Greeks how they used they put all kinds of stuff.
*  I'm going to take a note if you don't mind.
*  Yeah the immortality key this is the oh there Brian's got it right there.
*  It's a really just listen to the podcast the recent podcast that I did with this guy it's
*  amazing.
*  He's a scholar of the Greek classics and Greek history and he focused on the what did they
*  call it the Lucinian mysteries.
*  Okay.
*  Where they would they have these rituals where they would all elucis and they would all get
*  together and they would have these rituals where they would drink this spiked wine and
*  the wine was they they've proven now the wine was spiked with LSD like components was
*  spiked with ergot and they believe with probably a bunch of other different psychedelics maybe
*  psilocybin maybe a bunch but it was wines that had these psychedelic compounds and they
*  would have these incredible rituals and people would go there and this is like literally
*  like the foundation of Western civilization came from these these rituals and then these
*  rituals were forbidden by the Roman emperors and then they started doing these rituals
*  outside of Greek outside of Greece and they started doing them in Spain and they found
*  images of them doing it in Italy and they found a residue of these substances in pottery
*  and they've proven that it traveled all over the place but what was fascinating to me is
*  that their wine was never just wine they would put all sorts of different things in the wine
*  and like wine was in that back then was not just simply grapes that were fermented they
*  would add cinnamon and honey and all these different things to the wine which I thought
*  it was really fascinating.
*  Okay.
*  Yeah but the the fact that it was the source of their psychedelic rituals was wine.
*  All right I'm gonna read that.
*  Yeah watch the podcast.
*  Okay.
*  He's just he's really great at describing it and it's a very condensed thing and then
*  to further go get into the book.
*  Did you did you watch the Fantastic Fungi film.
*  I haven't seen that yet.
*  I started watching I was about halfway through like this been I've been kind of busy Joe but.
*  But you have 50 jobs I would imagine you're a little and you have a family I don't know
*  how the fuck you do it.
*  It seems.
*  Well my wife is a fucking badass she's more of a badass than I am and she can she holds
*  a lot of other things down that that I wouldn't be able to do without her.
*  So we have a nice symbiotic energetic relationship.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  If I find someone who is has that many jobs they almost always have an awesome wife.
*  Yeah she's amazing.
*  Yeah.
*  I couldn't I could not do any of this shit without her.
*  Absolutely.
*  That's a great thing man.
*  Have a great team like that because when I look at this all the things you do I'm like
*  restaurants wines now you're making mead and then you have from going to Michigan now
*  to like meet with a couple of winemakers there because I'm going to probably put a facility
*  there because my dad's house is there.
*  So I'm going to go ask for I'm going to my dad's house.
*  Well they're trying to kill Michigan.
*  So it's a good place to go right now.
*  They're literally it's the governor's making everything fall apart.
*  I'm going to find out.
*  So you get land for like a buck.
*  I'm going to fix it.
*  Do whatever you need to do.
*  So we're going to go and I'm going to make me cider and possibly wine in Michigan.
*  I just had a friend came back from Michigan.
*  He told me horror stories.
*  Now where I live.
*  You look at look at my porch and there's like a 16 acres of trees.
*  You know deer walking through your yard.
*  I don't talk about I don't know either.
*  I'm just repeating what other people tell me.
*  Yeah.
*  I want to do.
*  Yeah.
*  You can pretend you know what you're saying.
*  Yeah.
*  So what part of Michigan.
*  Upper right on Lake Michigan.
*  Oh nice.
*  Yeah.
*  Mason County.
*  Oh so that's pretty rural.
*  Yeah.
*  Why did you choose that area.
*  That's where my dad was a teacher.
*  So I went when I lived when I left Ohio I went to live with my dad in Michigan and that's
*  where he was wrestling coach and teacher in Western Michigan.
*  So he built a house.
*  He and Nick to Tarchik this big motherfucker.
*  He and his sons and my dad built the house that I own now in in Scottville.
*  Oh wow.
*  So it's that's why I'm going back to check in on the house.
*  Look at these buildings that we've been looking at set up a situation.
*  So I have my friend Tim White's with me in the car.
*  Nice my winemaking partner.
*  So we're going to we're just exploring a building going to talk to some growers.
*  There's definitely cider there.
*  I mean there's apples everywhere and I can make mead tomorrow because you can get honey.
*  What keeps you motivated to constantly do like these new projects another project like
*  this puzzles.
*  I just fucking love puzzles.
*  You know physical large scale sculptural and big space puzzles.
*  So you think of like almost like constructing a new business or a warehouse or a factory
*  like this or a creation of like like an art piece.
*  Yeah that and also watching what we just went through with this lockdown.
*  You know we have I have three greenhouses so we were able to feed a bunch of people
*  in our in our hundred you know family extended family with the businesses and everything.
*  We were able to like provide a little bit of food not not as much as they would need
*  but we certainly saved them at least one or two trips to the grocery store by by providing
*  them pasta you know some of the fresh vegetables a roll of toilet paper you know some soap
*  like that kind of shit that they just couldn't get at the store.
*  We had to go through commercial channels to get some of this these materials together.
*  That's a severely underrated pleasure to be able to provide for people.
*  Yeah I mean it's so we were able to do that for over 100 families you know in our in our
*  little circle.
*  I want to build I want to build more of that.
*  I want to do more of that.
*  So I think that's awesome.
*  So I think in a little town like there's all these little towns all over the United States
*  that dried up because they put the bypass in and put the Wal-Mart and the Home Depot
*  out away from the little town.
*  Beautiful structures you know solid buildings that just dried up.
*  So you're now you're seeing a resurgence of these little towns turning around from what
*  they were to being these little thriving things and the kind of cornerstone of that stuff
*  is you know food lodging restaurant brewery or winery distillery.
*  You know there's there's that little concentration of things.
*  Old Town Cottonwood Arizona that's a hot spot for wineries even though the vineyards and the
*  winemakers are down in Wilcox or Senoita or Elgin one of their tasting rooms is in this little
*  old town that was just beat to shit like 15 years ago you could you could you know pick up the
*  property for you know they pay you to take it.
*  But now it's like a little thriving metropolis because you have this concentration of restaurants
*  and wineries in this one little spot.
*  That's interesting.
*  I think we're also starting to be aware of the value and having everything you need in
*  close proximity where you're not shipping things in.
*  Right.
*  It used to be like the idea of buy American was sort of this xenophobic you know semi racist
*  notion that fuck the rest of the world we're number one.
*  But now people going oh but you know what wouldn't it be great if we can get our medicine
*  here we don't have to rely on boats that come over from China.
*  Like wouldn't it be wouldn't it be great if all the components that we need to make an
*  automobile were actually manufactured and constructed right here.
*  Wouldn't it be great if a fucking single cell phone was made in America.
*  I mean they don't make a goddamn one of them here.
*  Everything is made in Asia.
*  I still think you're going to need you're going to need to trade the trade routes have to stay
*  open.
*  There's things that you can't do well or as well as somebody else in terms of just you
*  know the spice trade was exactly that you couldn't grow that you couldn't grow these spices
*  here.
*  You had to get them from someone else and they were desirable.
*  You know tulips in Holland.
*  Like there's just there's something that's that's wanted and desired by other places.
*  And there's things you can do really well for sure.
*  It would be nice to be self sustainable.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  Like trade is always going to be significant.
*  And those end up being those end up being the side dishes that are like the icing on
*  the cake in a way.
*  But you should be able to figure out what grows in your area what's sustainable in your
*  area and what you know what you can do to kind of like you don't have to shut your borders
*  off just right.
*  Just be open to understanding that when the shit hits the fan you guys are kind of have
*  a little self contained thing that you can weather it.
*  Yeah that would be nice.
*  And this is this is a new feeling like I never I never thought about that before.
*  But in the beginning of the lockdown one of the things I was thinking I was like are we
*  going to come to a point where we don't have enough food.
*  Like how is the food going to get here.
*  Are people if they're not working are they going to grow the food.
*  What happens if the like the early predictions were terrifying right.
*  They're going to lose two million Americans like everybody is terrified.
*  That didn't come to pass.
*  But it was a moment where you're like well what if this gets way worse than that even.
*  Like how are we going to get to a point where there's no power.
*  Are we going to get to a point.
*  I mean what are we relying on that's not necessarily going to be here.
*  When we think about what do we need to sustain ourselves.
*  What are we relying on that may or may not be here if the shit hits the fan.
*  And I feel like this was kind of a practice run.
*  Yes.
*  I feel like it's good.
*  There's another one coming and you're going to have a shit ton of people that don't make it because you're like that first one was fake and this one is too.
*  Cool.
*  Can I can I get a set of keys to your house.
*  Because I think it's strange.
*  It's strange.
*  I'm just going to had a friend a long time ago who had been in in Iraq and he had taken some whatever he had to take for anthrax or whatever.
*  And he used to joke like if we get hit with anthrax it's going to affect you.
*  It's not going to affect me and I'm just going to tell you now I'm going through your pockets.
*  No offense.
*  Yeah I think this is a practice run and I wonder you know I wonder how many people are going to relax again after this is over because if something really big happens like and this is.
*  And I'm not trying to diminish anybody that lost a loved one or to diminish the significance of this disease a 200 plus thousand people that died in this country but compared to a super volcano compared to solar flare or an asteroid impact or an entire state on fire.
*  Well that well that's California to two states now Colorado.
*  Yeah California's lost more than a million acres.
*  Yeah.
*  So you add all those things up and they start to really look like something little pieces.
*  Yeah. So remember how to grow shit.
*  That's what I'm saying. Yes.
*  Remember how to grow shit.
*  That'd be very nice and don't go to a place where it doesn't rain.
*  Yeah.
*  Things light on fire a place where it doesn't rain.
*  Yeah.
*  Does it rain out in Jerome.
*  It hasn't rained for a long time but we had so much snow two years ago and this last year that the snowpack actually fed the ground the water the groundwater.
*  So Jerome has a decent amount of water this year.
*  It hasn't rained.
*  So that's distressing.
*  You get all your stuff with well water.
*  Yeah.
*  It's all around spring mountain spring so we are guys.
*  Yeah.
*  So we.
*  And it's all the stuff that's gathered from the snowpack that's coming down through the rocks.
*  Now what during this whole pandemic what about your Austria and like serving.
*  It did okay.
*  We just we did everything you know whatever the rules were we went above and beyond the rules but we made sure we were providing food and we were making sure that we had stuff to serve you and making sure that people got fed.
*  What were the rules out there with it because it's not.
*  It was we were completely shut down for like six weeks seven weeks and then they said okay if you're if you're serving if you're serving food you have alcohol and you're serving food.
*  You can sell the bottles to go.
*  You can serve food to go.
*  So we did that set the table up did that as soon as they said okay you can be at 50 percent occupancy.
*  Okay great.
*  So you separate the tables out and let people come in you know wear your mask on your way to the bathroom just be cool just right.
*  Yeah.
*  And we did okay.
*  I mean we're not you know we're definitely down from last year but there's restaurants there's I mean the restaurant industry is fucking hammered.
*  I don't know if you're keeping up on that.
*  Oh believe me I've had it's Adam Perry Lang and Janet's agreement.
*  Yeah.
*  And she got Bobby Stuckey in here.
*  Who's Bobby Bobby Stuckey from Froska Food and Wine in Boulder Colorado.
*  Okay.
*  He's he's one of the I see him out there championing like trying to get this funding for the for the small restaurants.
*  These people that have these amazing restaurants I was telling you about Felix Felix is in Venice they're very lucky that they have this outside area there they could set up there and it's they're very fortunate they have that outside area.
*  They're very fortunate they have that kind of space.
*  Yeah.
*  But so many people do not.
*  Yeah.
*  And they're in L.A. just won't let them open.
*  I mean they won't let them open at half capacity they won't let them open.
*  Well you can't survive at half capacity.
*  Most restaurants are operating at a 10 percent margin if they're doing great.
*  They were Janet was explaining that when she was in here.
*  That's a it's a it's not it's not what you think.
*  It's like right.
*  What blows my mind though jumping you know several hats here is watching people go I'm just going to get my I'm going to get my relief money and hang out.
*  Hey you want a job.
*  We have this job we need to do where there's this job that continues to need to be done even when all this shit's going on like we're still digging holes we're still pulling my check then I won't get my check.
*  Okay.
*  So let's just be clear.
*  So you don't want to do help me do the job.
*  You want to get your money.
*  Okay.
*  It's not a lot of money and it's not going to be forever but I'm going to figure out a way to do this job without you.
*  And then when you come looking for the job and the money runs out I'm going to say fuck you eat a dick.
*  Hmm.
*  Bag of salty dicks or sweet salty whichever pick your dick you choose.
*  So is your salty bag of dicks for you because we figured out how to do without you.
*  We needed you.
*  We needed you.
*  And then you didn't want to do it.
*  So the amount of money is going to patch this up like it's where there's a thing we're actually doing.
*  We have to tend the vines.
*  We have to tend the greenhouse.
*  There's things we have to do to get there.
*  So you're talking about specific instances and inside of your community.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Okay.
*  I'm not I'm talking about in Los Angeles or in a big city.
*  You get that sort of diffusion of responsibility thing with so many people and there's a lot of people that just rather take that check just take what you're getting that out of employees.
*  Yeah.
*  Well used to be.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  We found a way around you.
*  But it's funny though some people will be angry at you for that.
*  They'll say well why should they risk their lives to work.
*  Yeah.
*  Why should you.
*  Well do you if you are going to do this with your employees do you give them precautions on how to protect themselves.
*  Oh absolutely.
*  We do.
*  The our employees are our first and first and foremost our employees are the first consideration keeping them safe.
*  So any any policies if I have to take the hit for the policy I'll take the hit for the policy because I'm protecting the employee.
*  Have you thought about providing them with vitamins and zinc and that kind of thing.
*  We just you know we put them in rubber suits.
*  Rubber suits.
*  I'm just kidding.
*  I got the Devo masks with that.
*  No just you just have you just have policies in place and you you arm them with the authority to have a person not be able to be in your store if they're not going to respect the constant interaction that that employee has to go through all day long.
*  It's the same thing as a plane like that.
*  That flight attendant had just breathe your cigarette smoke for years and do all of them die of cancer.
*  No.
*  Did some of them get cancer.
*  Not all of them got cancer.
*  Not all of them died of cancer but they risk getting.
*  That was the argument about bars too right.
*  They should be able to smoke in bars.
*  Like what about the people that have to work in those bars.
*  Every day they're exposing that person to that thing.
*  That's why you don't.
*  Not because of you.
*  Not because of my clothing being stinking like cigarettes.
*  No it's because that person is being exposed to that every day and the more they're exposed to it the more they're being put at risk.
*  That's your that responsibility for your fellow human is that.
*  But on the bright side we have been provided with videos of these fucking non-mask protesting douchebags that just scream at Walmart and scream at people about the taking away my rights.
*  Comedy is like the cornucopia of comedy is just like billowing out like all year long.
*  It's been incredible.
*  It's amazing how many people are just fine.
*  I have to cut you off pretty soon.
*  I got to get.
*  Yeah you got to get your flight.
*  So one more time let's go over the thing.
*  It's the what is the date of the last stream.
*  October 30th.
*  October 30th is the concert film being streamed online at PussiforLive.com.
*  You can get tickets.
*  The album itself is out on the 30th as well.
