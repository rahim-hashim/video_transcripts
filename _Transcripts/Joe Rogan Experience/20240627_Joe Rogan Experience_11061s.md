**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ)
*  Welcome aboard, John. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  Very nice to meet you, man. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  I've been admiring your Instagram page and all the social media stuff forever, and it's [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  crazy and perplexing, and so I couldn't wait to get you in here and see how the hell did [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=19.76s)]
*  you acquire this magical spot that you have in Alaska? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=23.8s)]
*  I'd have to give you some context. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=28.52s)]
*  And I grew up on an Indian mound in North Florida, to give you an idea. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=31.88s)]
*  An Indian mound? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=37.16s)]
*  Yeah, my parents moved this family down from Ohio and bought nine acres on the St. Johns [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=38.16s)]
*  River in 1962. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=42.36s)]
*  This is where I grew up, and it was on top of an Indian mound. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=44.64s)]
*  We didn't know it at the time, so I was always out digging in the mound looking for pottery, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  and I was always captivated by looking for treasure. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=52.16s)]
*  I did that as a kid, and then did a lot of surfing and stuff like that, as you might [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=56.52s)]
*  think, in Florida, and got to be pretty good at swimming. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=64.52000000000001s)]
*  Ended up in high school setting the American record in a 50-yard freestyle. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=69.2s)]
*  And there was a fellow, an assistant coach at the University of Florida named Eddie Reese. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=76.32000000000001s)]
*  You might recognize his name. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=81.4s)]
*  He's the head coach at the University of Texas right here. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=82.68s)]
*  Three-time Olympic coach, widely regarded now as the greatest swim coach of all time. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=86.68s)]
*  I gave him a call before we came over here just to say hello. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=91.96000000000001s)]
*  We're in and out quick. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=96.12s)]
*  But he recruited me to Florida, and I got recruited at a couple other colleges because [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=97.12s)]
*  I was a pretty quick swimmer. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=102.80000000000001s)]
*  University of Alabama, I met Bear Bryant, the swim coach, took me by the practice field [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=105.12s)]
*  and introduced me to him. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=109.96000000000001s)]
*  He said, can you catch a football? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=113.48s)]
*  You should be a football player. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=115.92s)]
*  You're too big to be a swimmer. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=116.92s)]
*  That was a couple hundred pounds ago, by the way, I should mention. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=121.08s)]
*  He says, can you catch a football? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=125.76s)]
*  I said, yeah, I think so. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=128.24s)]
*  He said, hey, Joe, Joe, come over here. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=129.24s)]
*  Throw this guy a pass. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=131.8s)]
*  There's Joe and Ameth. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=132.8s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=134.84s)]
*  He says, go long. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=135.84s)]
*  I start running down the field, threw me a ball, and I said, you've got to catch this. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=137.84s)]
*  You've got to catch this. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=141.64s)]
*  And I caught it. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=142.64s)]
*  He says, throw it back. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=143.64s)]
*  And I did. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=145.16s)]
*  And then went to the swimming pool, met all the swimmers and all that kind of stuff. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=146.52s)]
*  And then I got recruited by Florida at Coach Eddie Reese and decided I want to go to Florida [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=151.48s)]
*  that seemed like a lot more fun. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=157.28s)]
*  I went to Florida. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  The first year I was there, I was an All-American swimmer. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=162.48s)]
*  And I got seventh place at West Point in the NCAAs. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=167.95999999999998s)]
*  The next year, my coach, the NCAAs were in Knoxville, Tennessee. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=173.2s)]
*  He says, coach says, you don't win this. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=179.76s)]
*  I'm going to send you to Alaska. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=183.35999999999999s)]
*  Alaska? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=186.28s)]
*  What's that? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=187.83999999999997s)]
*  I hadn't even thought about Alaska. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=189.12s)]
*  I got second place. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=191.52s)]
*  So OK. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=194.16000000000003s)]
*  I'm going to Alaska. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=196.76000000000002s)]
*  I didn't win it. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=199.48000000000002s)]
*  Now here I am, full scholarship, great family. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=201.08s)]
*  I had five sisters growing up and doing real good. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=207.16000000000003s)]
*  I said, fuck it, I only got second place. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=214.32000000000002s)]
*  I'm going to Alaska. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=216.76000000000002s)]
*  So I dropped out of college. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=217.76000000000002s)]
*  So just because he said that? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=218.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=221.23999999999998s)]
*  Obviously, he was probably fucking around, right? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=222.23999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, he was fucking around. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=226.16s)]
*  But the thing is, I was such a shitty student, if I didn't drop out, I was going to flunk [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=227.56s)]
*  out. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=231.04s)]
*  And I talked to the registrar there by the name of Wendy Smallwood, who took care of [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=232.51999999999998s)]
*  all the athletes coming in. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=236.35999999999999s)]
*  He said, man, if you don't get out of here, you're going to flunk out. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=237.35999999999999s)]
*  So I said, well, if I drop out, can I come back my junior year? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=243.44s)]
*  And she goes, oh, yeah, you can do that. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=247.44s)]
*  But if you flunk out, no. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=250.08s)]
*  I said, OK, I think I will. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=252.4s)]
*  Then I saw a movie called Jeremiah Johnson. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=254.08s)]
*  I said, you know what? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=257.52s)]
*  I won't be a mountain man. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=259.6s)]
*  And then after that, I went down to the registrar's office, took the dropout sheet, wrote Gone [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=263.32s)]
*  Fishing on it as my excuse, hung it on my college door. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=268.84000000000003s)]
*  I had played two card gut poker game the night before. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=273.28000000000003s)]
*  I had $50. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=277.12s)]
*  I got enough. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=279.96000000000004s)]
*  Put that in the next morning, 6 o'clock in the morning, taped that to my door and out [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=282.16s)]
*  the door I went with a backpack and shotgun. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=285.28000000000003s)]
*  And that's about all I had. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=288.44s)]
*  Hitchhiked, got down to I-75 and started hitchhiking. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=290.68s)]
*  Somebody picked you up with a shotgun? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=292.68s)]
*  It was in a case. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=294.68s)]
*  Oh. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=295.68s)]
*  Got me in trouble in Seattle. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=296.68s)]
*  I got arrested for being the I-5 sniper. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=297.68s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=300.16s)]
*  And that was, you know. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=301.16s)]
*  Sniper with a shotgun? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=303.08000000000004s)]
*  Well, they had to look at the shotgun to find out I wasn't the sniper because the sniper [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=304.12s)]
*  used a rifle. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=307.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=308.88s)]
*  I just walked into that. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=309.88s)]
*  I mean, it was like I made a phone call at a gas station and pretty soon all the nearby [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=311.68s)]
*  where the sniper was shooting the day before. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=316.96s)]
*  So all these cops showed up. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=320.52s)]
*  I had only time I'd been arrested by 60 police officers. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=321.71999999999997s)]
*  And I was, he goes, okay, killer, where's the gun? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=325.96s)]
*  I go, what are you talking about? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=328.59999999999997s)]
*  I forgot where I put the shotgun. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=331.8s)]
*  So I'm wandering around the gas station looking for it. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=334.24s)]
*  Found it tucked between the water cooler and a wall where I'd stopped to take a drink of [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=337.8s)]
*  water when all the action started. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=341.24s)]
*  So they, yeah, it's a shotgun. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=343.68s)]
*  They took me back to the University of Seattle. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=346.24s)]
*  I told them I had been sleeping in the brush. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=348.96000000000004s)]
*  You know, there was a board there that said, writers needed to Alaska must be mechanically [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=351.76000000000005s)]
*  and kind. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=357.16s)]
*  So I called that number. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=358.16s)]
*  I said, oh yeah, fuck yeah. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=359.8s)]
*  I'm a mechanic. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=360.88s)]
*  No idea. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=365.28000000000003s)]
*  But I said, what do you got? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=366.28000000000003s)]
*  He goes, a Volkswagen van. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=367.96000000000004s)]
*  Oh, luckily that was the only vehicle I'd ever turned a wrench on because earlier, like [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=369.88s)]
*  two years earlier, three years earlier, I went on a surfing safari from Florida to California, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=376.56s)]
*  you know, Volkswagen van. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=382.52s)]
*  We had to drop the engine out in Tempe, Arizona. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=383.52s)]
*  It's only four bolts, but we had a spare engine because we figured that might happen. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=386.44s)]
*  So anyways, I got ahold of the guy, rode up to Alaska with him and got about six jobs [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=391.36s)]
*  because one thing I couldn't do as a swimmer is you're always working out. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=400.64s)]
*  You know, swim six hours a day for six years and never made any money. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=405.04s)]
*  I got up there and I had like part time jobs, swim coach, working as a film editor from [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=412.44s)]
*  the University of Alaska. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=417.35999999999996s)]
*  Just different bullshit jobs that I could make. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=419.88s)]
*  Money man, I'm making money. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=422.76s)]
*  I like this. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=423.76s)]
*  So I came back after that, Joe, and I went back to college. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=425.32s)]
*  And I mentioned, I think that I was a shitty student. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=431.67999999999995s)]
*  I didn't get any better my junior year. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=435.15999999999997s)]
*  So junior year, I go, I'm done. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=438.76s)]
*  I went to the NCAAs in Long Beach. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=443.44s)]
*  Didn't do very well. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=446.15999999999997s)]
*  And knew I was going to go. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=449.59999999999997s)]
*  They had the swim banquet at the end of the year and the head coach told me by now, Eddie [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=451.48s)]
*  Reese had moved on to another college. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=457.24s)]
*  I think he went to Auburn. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=459.71999999999997s)]
*  He looked at our team and he said, I'm going to go places. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=462.34s)]
*  Instead of being an assistant coach, I'm going to be a head coach. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=465.68s)]
*  And then he ended up at Texas where he's been Olympic coach three times, countless national [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=469.68s)]
*  championships. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=474.84000000000003s)]
*  Just a good guy. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=476.96000000000004s)]
*  And I know you love sports. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=477.96000000000004s)]
*  He's the winning coach in swimming history. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=481.56s)]
*  If you ever get a chance to meet that guy, he's awesome. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=485.88s)]
*  And so I went back and the coach said at the banquet, you've been elected captain for [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=491.12s)]
*  the senior year. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=496.12s)]
*  I said, I ain't doing it. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=498.28000000000003s)]
*  I'm going to Alaska. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=499.28000000000003s)]
*  I'm out of here, man. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=500.28000000000003s)]
*  So off I went. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=502.44s)]
*  I went back to Alaska and I've been there since. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=503.92s)]
*  What made you want to go back? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=507.42s)]
*  Just Alaska's a big country, man. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=509.6s)]
*  Big country. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=512.84s)]
*  And just spacious. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=515.04s)]
*  I wanted to be a gold miner too. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=521.12s)]
*  And I had done some gold panning up there and I'm going to go be a gold miner. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=524.08s)]
*  Well, I got there in 74 and I got a job up there as a teamster. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=528.12s)]
*  It was right before the pipeline. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=533.28s)]
*  Started hauling freight as a teamster and put my money into a little gold mining operation [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=536.88s)]
*  on a creek that some guy sold me. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=543.8s)]
*  He said, there's a lot of gold on this creek. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=545.48s)]
*  There wasn't shit on that creek, but he got my money. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=548.5200000000001s)]
*  And so went out there and did our best for the summer and ended up going broke mining. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=552.24s)]
*  And I said, well, I didn't do it right. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=557.72s)]
*  So ended up getting a job running air freight, working prior to the pipeline. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=561.9200000000001s)]
*  Then the pipeline started getting going. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=569.6400000000001s)]
*  And a buddy of mine who's a diver at the University of Florida, he came up to Alaska. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=572.44s)]
*  And he got on as an air freight driver for CF Air Freight, Consolidated Freightways. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=578.68s)]
*  I was a teamster for him. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=584.76s)]
*  And he was driving a truck for the terminal manager who owned the truck for the air freight [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=587.08s)]
*  division. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=593.8s)]
*  And they said, that's a conflict of interest. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=595.56s)]
*  You need to sell the truck to somebody else. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=597.04s)]
*  Let them hire a company to do it. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=598.88s)]
*  So he said, you guys want to buy this truck, this business? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=602.4s)]
*  And how much? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=606.6s)]
*  He said, 10,000 bucks. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=608.2s)]
*  We had nothing. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=610.52s)]
*  We went to every bank in town. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=611.52s)]
*  Now, you guys are 20 somethings, 24. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=614.4s)]
*  You got no collateral. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=618.52s)]
*  You want to buy a $10,000 truck. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=620.44s)]
*  You know, there's going to be a business associated with it. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=621.9200000000001s)]
*  Last bank we went to was the first national bank. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=626.88s)]
*  And the guy standing at the counter heard us talking to the manager. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=631.12s)]
*  And he goes, hey Bill, Bill was the name of the manager at the bank. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=636.64s)]
*  He goes, hey Bill, I'll back their play. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=640.52s)]
*  We looked at the guy. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=644.0s)]
*  He looked familiar because we had delivered some windshields to him. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=645.0s)]
*  He was a windshield guy. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=648.48s)]
*  He had a junkyard and spare parts and stuff like that. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=649.96s)]
*  So he co-signed a note. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=654.64s)]
*  I knew him as well as I know you right now. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=656.84s)]
*  And pretty soon, the manager of the air freight company called us in. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=660.72s)]
*  He says, boys, your life's about to change. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=664.88s)]
*  And we said, what's that mean? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=667.6s)]
*  He goes, we just got the contract to handle all the air freight for the Aliesco pipeline. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=670.24s)]
*  We said, what's the Aliesco pipeline? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=677.4s)]
*  Well, the big pipeline they're going to be building up here. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=679.64s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=684.84s)]
*  What's that mean to us? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=685.84s)]
*  He says, that means you're going to get rich. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=687.24s)]
*  Your first delivery sitting over at Reed Tool. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=688.52s)]
*  What is it? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=692.6s)]
*  Drill bits. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=693.6s)]
*  How much? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=694.6s)]
*  10,000 pounds. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=695.6s)]
*  You got to remember, we're getting paid by the pound to deliver air freight. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=696.6s)]
*  Generally speaking, a minimum piece of freight, less than 50 pounds, was like $5.40 a pound [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=703.6s)]
*  or a delivery. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=712.28s)]
*  We made 700 bucks or something in minutes for them to drive a forklift up, unload the [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=714.4s)]
*  pallet and haul it off. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=720.36s)]
*  I looked at my partner, Ken, and I said, man, we're going to do good. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=722.88s)]
*  And within a short amount of time, within a year and a half, we handled all the air [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=726.8s)]
*  freight north of the Alaska Range. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=732.08s)]
*  We're bringing in 747 Flying Tigers into Anchorage every night, three of them, solid freight. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=734.6s)]
*  Tranship the freight from the plane to a flatbed truck. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=740.36s)]
*  We get 10 or 12 trucks every morning before 8 o'clock. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=744.32s)]
*  We take it over to the North Star Terminals where it was unloaded. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=749.66s)]
*  And we weren't allowed to touch it because those guys were a different union. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=753.2199999999999s)]
*  And we'd just drink coffee. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=757.9s)]
*  Then they'd sign our bill of ladings. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=760.3399999999999s)]
*  We'd be out of there every morning by about, well, before the coffee even got cold. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=763.0999999999999s)]
*  With about 30, 40 grand worth of revenue. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=768.14s)]
*  I did that to a couple of young guys that had never had money in Alaska during a pipeline. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=772.26s)]
*  That's the recipe for disaster. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=779.54s)]
*  And boy, did we go through it. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=783.14s)]
*  You know, it was crazy. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=788.9s)]
*  We'd walk into a, a buddy of mine had a restaurant named Jack O'Brien and he called them, I. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=790.5s)]
*  Re. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=794.5s)]
*  Jacks up there in Fairbanks. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=795.5s)]
*  Good man. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=796.5s)]
*  And we'd go in and go, there'd be 200 people in that restaurant. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=798.38s)]
*  And I didn't know the guy very well, but we lived in the same area out in the woods nearby [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=802.24s)]
*  his restaurant. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=806.02s)]
*  We go there on occasion. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=807.88s)]
*  I say, Jack, dinner's on me tonight for everybody in here. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=810.4s)]
*  And drinks. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=815.0s)]
*  You know, really? [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=816.0s)]
*  I said, yeah, really. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=817.0s)]
*  At the end of the night, it was like 40 grand. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=818.0s)]
*  Boom. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=822.92s)]
*  I'm telling you, all of a sudden I had a little money. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=823.92s)]
*  Didn't know any better. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=829.48s)]
*  And we spent it and we had fun and we built a pipeline. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=832.5999999999999s)]
*  A lot of stuff happened during that pipeline that people don't even realize. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=835.9599999999999s)]
*  That thing was only supposed to cost $800 million to build. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=839.16s)]
*  It cost $9 billion. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=842.3199999999999s)]
*  It seems like the companies that were building it, they call them the Seven Sisters, you [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=848.8s)]
*  know, all the big oil companies were grouped together. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=854.88s)]
*  And the operating company was called Alaska Pipeline. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=859.32s)]
*  And it was like somebody flew over Alaska and said, let's drop $9 billion on these guys [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=861.52s)]
*  and see what they do with it. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=867.92s)]
*  It was totally unbelievable. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=869.96s)]
*  OK, so you got all this money? [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=871.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=874.4s)]
*  Got all this money. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=875.4s)]
*  And then at the end of the pipeline, I told my partner, you want to buy this company for [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=878.16s)]
*  me or you want me to buy it from you? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=882.52s)]
*  Well, flip the coin, come over the fair price. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=884.08s)]
*  Flip the coin, he won, he bought me out. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=887.76s)]
*  And I said, OK, now I had a little money. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=889.52s)]
*  Went to work drilling for uranium for Exxon and Chevron up in the Seward Peninsula for [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=892.04s)]
*  a company called Resource Associates and it was just a guy hauling the drill rig around. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=899.68s)]
*  And from there, I started getting more interested in the mining end of things. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=905.72s)]
*  And keep in mind, I'm still a young guy. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=911.24s)]
*  I'm not married yet. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=912.72s)]
*  And we'd go to Costa Rica. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=914.28s)]
*  I bought a farm down there and decided I'd be a coffee farmer. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=916.24s)]
*  I wasn't worth a shit at that either. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=919.08s)]
*  I had some lemon trees growing and the first deal I made, I sold 500 lemons for three bucks. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=922.6s)]
*  I said, I don't think I'm going to make money, not farming. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=927.12s)]
*  So I go back to Alaska and I protected the little wealth I had. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=932.08s)]
*  I was able to protect by going to Costa Rica. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=935.32s)]
*  Costa Rica is named Costa Rica because of its beauty, not because it's got a lot of [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=938.9200000000001s)]
*  treasure. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=943.76s)]
*  You have conquistadors going by going, let's call this place Costa Rica. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=944.76s)]
*  These murderous guys going totally in the Incas and the Aztecs can attest to this. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=948.4399999999999s)]
*  They're there for its treasure. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=954.92s)]
*  And so I got back to Alaska, started getting serious. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=956.4399999999999s)]
*  My wife's name is Ramona. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=960.96s)]
*  We got married when I was 28 and we have five kids of our own, the youngest out there, Laura [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=962.12s)]
*  and Drew is my CEO and her husband. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=968.72s)]
*  Her sister, just older than her, they own a company called Gold Daughters. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=973.3599999999999s)]
*  My wife and I bought an old dredge after I'd gone, I decided to go mining for somebody [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=979.4799999999999s)]
*  else as an equipment operator. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=984.4s)]
*  So I went up and I drove a loader, 712s, and was able to get paid in gold and that would [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=988.28s)]
*  help get me through Costa Rica. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=997.4s)]
*  The price of gold when I started was 250 bucks an ounce and when I ended it was 800 bucks [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1000.68s)]
*  an ounce and I said, oh this is glorious. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1005.2399999999999s)]
*  So I was making money gold mining and learned a lot about gold mining. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1008.7199999999999s)]
*  I learned a lot about how to do it and I learned a lot about how not to do it. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1013.64s)]
*  And so after that I decided, well, I've got to get into something else. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1018.0799999999999s)]
*  I was driving back to town and I had to stop, had been drinking some beers. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1024.76s)]
*  I had not had a beer all summer. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1030.56s)]
*  And through the trees I see these big metal pipes sticking out of the ground. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1033.2s)]
*  It was the fall time. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1040.8s)]
*  So I walked back there and it's a gold dredge. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1041.96s)]
*  Are you familiar with what a gold dredge looks like? [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1044.3999999999999s)]
*  The machine? [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1046.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1047.84s)]
*  It's a big, huge, floating barge with a digging ladder and a tailing stacker and a trommel. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1048.84s)]
*  This one was about, it's a six cubic foot dredge. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1053.9199999999998s)]
*  Each bucket would hold six cubic feet of dirt. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1057.3600000000001s)]
*  And while I was there some other people drove in. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1061.44s)]
*  They walked in and I'd never seen one. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1063.8s)]
*  I didn't know it was there just outside of town. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1066.52s)]
*  And these people were going on it and I said, man, this would be a cool tourist attraction. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1069.68s)]
*  So I found out who owned it. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1076.68s)]
*  I got ahold of the guys that owned it and I said, hey, you guys want to sell that dredge? [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1077.8400000000001s)]
*  They said, sure, we'll sell it. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1082.6000000000001s)]
*  We were going to turn it into a tourist attraction, but we bought some leases in a place called [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1085.82s)]
*  Prudhoe Bay. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1091.26s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1092.26s)]
*  You guys don't want to be in tourism anymore. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1093.26s)]
*  They had some of the best leases in Prudhoe Bay where the oil was coming from. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1097.74s)]
*  So I bought it. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1102.3799999999999s)]
*  We bought it. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1103.3799999999999s)]
*  Moved to Bunkhouse over there to it. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1104.3799999999999s)]
*  Turned it into a really nice tourist attraction. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1107.34s)]
*  And then I said, you know, Carnival Cruise Lines owned a company called Holland America [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1112.9s)]
*  West Tours. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1118.9s)]
*  And they came up and said, hey, I was in my 40s. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1119.9s)]
*  They say, you're a pretty young guy. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1124.8200000000002s)]
*  We don't think you should ever have to work again. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1126.5s)]
*  I said, I've been thinking the same fucking thing. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1128.26s)]
*  So they bought it from us. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1131.7s)]
*  Okay, now I'm out of tourism. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1133.5s)]
*  I want to go mining. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1137.5400000000002s)]
*  I got to know the owners of a company called Alaska Gold Company. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1139.46s)]
*  Prior to that was called Fairbanks Exploration Company and a parent company. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1146.1399999999999s)]
*  So that was called the United States Smelting, Refining and Mining Company. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1150.22s)]
*  So I was the next guy in line. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1154.36s)]
*  It was a privately owned company all that time. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1155.5s)]
*  And at the time I bought that company, I became the largest private landowner in Alaska with [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1159.1s)]
*  10,000 acres of patented land with proven reserves close to 800,000 ounces. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1167.82s)]
*  And gold was low. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1173.46s)]
*  These guys were tired of it. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1174.78s)]
*  They'd run it from 1925 until I bought it. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1175.94s)]
*  Took out over 8 million ounces. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1180.66s)]
*  I'm going to say over 8 million, but records indicate a little bit different. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1182.62s)]
*  And in the process of that, I went down to Utah and got all their archive material, which [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1188.74s)]
*  included all the notes and the correspondence files and exploration files and stratigraphic [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1194.1s)]
*  files and the researches. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1199.98s)]
*  All the paperwork they had in Boston because Boston is where USSR and M was headquartered. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1203.38s)]
*  So I had kind of an advantage in the gold mining business because now I have 10,000 [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1209.26s)]
*  acres of land. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1215.02s)]
*  A lot of it already mined out by the dredges, but the dredges only took what they could [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1216.02s)]
*  make at $20 an ounce. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1220.02s)]
*  When they stopped, it was $35 an ounce. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1223.18s)]
*  And I didn't check today, but I think it's close to $1,800 an ounce. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1226.7s)]
*  And they only mined what was good at that time. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1231.3000000000002s)]
*  It's like if you imagine a chicken, you got the white meat, which is where all the pay [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1235.26s)]
*  was, and then you got your drumsticks and your wings on the margins. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1241.5400000000002s)]
*  And that's the kind of stuff that was left. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1245.7800000000002s)]
*  It wasn't worth mining back when I bought the company, but it is now. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1249.26s)]
*  So now we have some really good properties and the exploration files that cover the entire [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1253.34s)]
*  state of Alaska. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1259.4199999999998s)]
*  And Drew out there, he's got hard rock claims in Valdez that we picked a file out of the [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1261.6599999999999s)]
*  exploration files and identified an area that no one even knew about, except our company [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1267.3s)]
*  engineers who died decades ago. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1273.1399999999999s)]
*  Our consultants are all dead. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1277.54s)]
*  All these reports that we read were written in the 20s and 30s and 40s. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1281.62s)]
*  But they're all gone. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1287.26s)]
*  And they weren't trying to promote mining. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1289.06s)]
*  They were trying to find gold. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1290.38s)]
*  So if they say there's gold here, there's gold there. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1292.62s)]
*  And that's what we're doing now. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1298.18s)]
*  We're a mining company. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1300.86s)]
*  But now we've morphed into a land management company because we've got a half a dozen [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1302.94s)]
*  mines that are on different pieces of our ground, mining. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1308.14s)]
*  And we just manage the land. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1312.22s)]
*  Make sure that we got legitimate people mining. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1314.5800000000002s)]
*  OK, so this is how you get to the land. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1318.26s)]
*  How do you get these bones? [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1320.7800000000002s)]
*  How does this all start? [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1322.38s)]
*  Well, get into that. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1323.38s)]
*  And the way I discovered the bones was after I bought the property. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1325.46s)]
*  There was a stripping pile done by an adjacent miner that was dumping overburden on these [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1334.06s)]
*  flat tailings. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1342.14s)]
*  And I had a tour guide, a big guy. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1343.9s)]
*  I said, Josh, run over there and find me a mammoth tusk. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1347.1000000000001s)]
*  I'd never found a mammoth tusk, but I'd heard they were finding them over there. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1352.34s)]
*  And the ground they were dumping on was on my ground. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1355.8999999999999s)]
*  So he went and he says, what do they look like? [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1359.46s)]
*  I said, well, they look like tree trunks, only they've got a curve to them. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1363.34s)]
*  So he went and he was gone half an hour. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1366.6599999999999s)]
*  He comes back with a seven-foot tusk over his shoulder. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1368.6599999999999s)]
*  I went, holy shit. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1372.6599999999999s)]
*  I said, go get me another one. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1373.6599999999999s)]
*  He went and came back an hour later with another one about three feet long, a broken one. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1376.58s)]
*  So I walked over there to look at this area where the mining was going to take place. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1381.46s)]
*  And they ended up mining it. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1388.06s)]
*  They had a right to mine it. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1389.98s)]
*  The company took out about 3,000 ounces out of this one little area. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1391.98s)]
*  And I was like, god damn, this stuff stinks. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1396.58s)]
*  So one day we were walking around the area after they had mined it, moved on to another [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1400.1000000000001s)]
*  place and we fell off the smell. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1405.3400000000001s)]
*  We walked around the side of this hill and we got up in this little draw and we were [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1408.38s)]
*  picking, my kids were with me too, we were picking bones off the ground, little shards, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1413.46s)]
*  little leg bones and stuff. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1417.7s)]
*  So we filled up a garbage bag with those. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1420.3400000000001s)]
*  We went back again and again and again and then I took an excavator back, built a little [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1423.5400000000002s)]
*  road around the side so we could get back to it with a machine. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1428.42s)]
*  Took a couple digs out of the muck, found a mammoth tusk. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1432.66s)]
*  I said, oh boy, let's get something going. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1436.9s)]
*  So we got a big floating barge and put a pump on it, 471 Jimmy, with a giant. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1440.8200000000002s)]
*  They're called giants but they're actually hydraulic monitors. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1446.9s)]
*  They look like big long pipes that you spray water out of. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1449.8200000000002s)]
*  And our pump was an 8 inch intake, 6 inch outtake and we nozzled it down to 2 inches, [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1454.22s)]
*  2 and a half inches. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1459.3s)]
*  We could fire the water way out there and wash the overburden away. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1461.22s)]
*  The overburden there is about 60 feet high. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1464.42s)]
*  It's permafrost, silt. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1467.14s)]
*  Underneath that you have your gravel layer. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1470.14s)]
*  Underneath the gravel you have the gold and the bedrock. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1472.5800000000002s)]
*  And the gravel layer and the muck interface is where most of the bones are. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1476.54s)]
*  So we started finding lots of bones. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1482.66s)]
*  I mean, a lot of bones. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1484.42s)]
*  And in the first three years we found thousands and thousands of tusks and bison heads and [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1487.38s)]
*  bones. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1493.22s)]
*  And by the way, all those skulls you got out there in your building here, you ain't got [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1494.22s)]
*  a step bison skull. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1501.1000000000001s)]
*  I'm going to fix that shit. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1503.1000000000001s)]
*  Okay? [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1505.1000000000001s)]
*  I'm going to. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1506.1000000000001s)]
*  And then I don't even know how many we have. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1508.94s)]
*  We stopped counting. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1513.5s)]
*  And mammoth tusks, same thing. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1515.0600000000002s)]
*  When did step bisons go extinct? [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1517.18s)]
*  12,000 years ago. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1518.98s)]
*  Wow. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1520.98s)]
*  And so the permafrost is slowly melting. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1521.98s)]
*  And you're hosing it down and pulling it. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1527.46s)]
*  So the stench is literally like this ancient rotting biological material. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1529.5800000000002s)]
*  It stinks. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1535.3000000000002s)]
*  Wow. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1536.3000000000002s)]
*  It's organic. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1537.3000000000002s)]
*  But it's been frozen forever. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1538.3000000000002s)]
*  Thousands. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1541.3000000000002s)]
*  20,000 years. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1542.3000000000002s)]
*  30,000 years. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1543.3000000000002s)]
*  50,000. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1544.3000000000002s)]
*  You with the hose spraying it onto the side of this wall. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1545.46s)]
*  So the way you do it is you just spray the side of these, like what would you call that [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1549.3s)]
*  hill? [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1554.18s)]
*  It's a muck bench. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1555.18s)]
*  A muck bench. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1556.18s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1557.18s)]
*  So you spray that until you see something poking through? [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1558.18s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1560.3799999999999s)]
*  Well, you spray it and then you walk up there and you turn the nozzle off the side and you'll [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1561.3799999999999s)]
*  pick up the bones, the little pieces, leg bones, backbones. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1565.5s)]
*  Why is there so much in this one area? [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1569.5s)]
*  Nobody knows. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1572.1s)]
*  Really? [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1573.1s)]
*  Nobody. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1574.1s)]
*  It's so crazy. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1575.8999999999999s)]
*  When I watch the documentary on your place, when you show this giant room where you have [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1576.8999999999999s)]
*  all these buckets of femurs and skulls and tusks and you have those paleontologists who [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1583.34s)]
*  are just like, they can't even believe what they're seeing. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1592.2199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1594.82s)]
*  That's because a lot of those animals, they say never lived up there during the ice age. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1595.82s)]
*  So when they see it and they still think that, I just say, well, they sure as fuck [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1601.2s)]
*  died here. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1606.4s)]
*  So it's changing their ideas of what existed in that area. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1610.8s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1614.92s)]
*  Wow. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1616.48s)]
*  And what's the oldest bones you guys have found? [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1617.48s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1619.4s)]
*  We've sampled maybe four or five of them. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1621.4s)]
*  It costs 400 bucks a sample to do a carbon-14 test on them. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1623.76s)]
*  If I was to sample my entire collection today, it'd cost $100 million. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1628.16s)]
*  Because we have close to a quarter million fossils now. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1634.88s)]
*  The whole place is crazy. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1638.28s)]
*  I mean, it's so hard to believe that this one area has so many bones. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1639.28s)]
*  They have no idea of like, did these animals fall into a muck pit? [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1645.6000000000001s)]
*  Why are they there? [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1652.28s)]
*  They don't know. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1653.28s)]
*  No. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1654.28s)]
*  Because there's so many of them. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1655.28s)]
*  And we're talking bones. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1656.28s)]
*  We're not even talking fossils. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1657.3999999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1658.8799999999999s)]
*  Right? [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1659.8799999999999s)]
*  Because they froze, which is very, very unusual. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1660.8799999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1663.8s)]
*  The documentary, you saw that Dick Mole, a paleontologist. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1664.8s)]
*  What an unfortunate name, by the way. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1669.56s)]
*  Dick Mole. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1672.32s)]
*  You know, I see what you're saying there. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1675.32s)]
*  I know you do. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1676.6s)]
*  Yeah, he's one of the good ones. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1678.36s)]
*  You know, he came up and spent a few days with us, with the filmmaker that made that [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1681.2s)]
*  film, by the way. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1685.92s)]
*  The filmmaker is an artist pure, just through and through. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1687.5600000000002s)]
*  And I met him when he was working for National Geographic. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1691.3600000000001s)]
*  And then he came to me and he says, hey, I'd like to make a documentary about the boneyard. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1695.48s)]
*  So I gave him unfettered access for four years. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1700.28s)]
*  I said, do what you got to do. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1702.28s)]
*  Just stay out of our way. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1704.0s)]
*  Don't make me worry about finding you under a muck bench or a tree falling on you. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1706.0s)]
*  Just go do your thing. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1710.0s)]
*  So he did. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1711.96s)]
*  And the stuff that you're seeing there, and you saw in that video that you watched, the [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1713.0s)]
*  documentary, it's like nobody knows why any of that stuff is there. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1719.52s)]
*  Is that the most unusual sight that they've ever discovered in terms of just the sheer [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1726.72s)]
*  quantity of bones? [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1731.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1732.72s)]
*  Wow. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1733.72s)]
*  And you just found it by accident. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1734.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1736.16s)]
*  It just makes you think, how many more of those are out there? [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1737.16s)]
*  Well, I know one more. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1739.68s)]
*  Really? [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1741.2s)]
*  Just the next creek down. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1742.44s)]
*  Yep. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1744.44s)]
*  So this area where you're extracting these bones from, how big is the actual area where [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1746.0s)]
*  you're finding these? [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1750.0800000000002s)]
*  Five acres. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1751.0800000000002s)]
*  That's it? [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1752.0800000000002s)]
*  That's it. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1753.0800000000002s)]
*  Wow. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1754.0800000000002s)]
*  And I get blamed. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1755.0800000000002s)]
*  Well, I have a, you're the, I got to be honest with you on a little thing here. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1756.0800000000002s)]
*  When you first mentioned the boneyard Alaska and talked about our site, I don't know how [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1763.5s)]
*  you found it, but you found it, and you had, who did you have on here? [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1769.64s)]
*  I think it was Forrest Galant. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1775.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, it was Forrest Galant. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1776.0800000000002s)]
*  And I picked up 5,000 followers on my Instagram account that day, and I said to myself, the [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1778.4s)]
*  only guy I remember to talk to about this site is Joe Rogan, ever. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1787.3200000000002s)]
*  And I used you as a crutch for three solid fucking years, because I didn't want to talk [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1793.64s)]
*  to anybody about this. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1799.28s)]
*  But everybody's so interested in it, and I said, I'll talk to Joe Rogan. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1802.44s)]
*  That's it. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1807.2s)]
*  I've had countless opportunities to talk to newscasters and network reality TV people [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1808.2s)]
*  that want to do blah, blah, blah, blah. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1814.2s)]
*  No, I ain't going to do it. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1816.0s)]
*  I'll talk to Joe Rogan about it. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1817.8799999999999s)]
*  Well, thank you for that. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1819.3999999999999s)]
*  No, thank you for that. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1820.68s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1822.2s)]
*  Well, it's just so unusual. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1823.2s)]
*  At first, I just thought, oh, you probably found a couple things on this place. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1825.32s)]
*  And then as I'm going over your Instagram page, I'm seeing all the stuff that you're [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1829.84s)]
*  pulling out of there. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1835.52s)]
*  I'm like, this doesn't even seem real. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1836.52s)]
*  How could this one area have so many bones and so many tusks? [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1839.36s)]
*  How many tusks do you have? [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1844.84s)]
*  Mammoth tusks. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1846.36s)]
*  We stopped counting. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1847.4399999999998s)]
*  Not because we can't count that high. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1849.72s)]
*  It's just because what's the point? [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1853.8s)]
*  Thousands? [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1856.84s)]
*  I have a friend that says I got 10,000 dead woolly mammoth on my ground. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1858.52s)]
*  Wow, in five acres. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1862.88s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1866.28s)]
*  Have any of these paleontologists speculated on why this one area would have so many dead [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1868.1200000000001s)]
*  animals? [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1874.16s)]
*  No. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1875.88s)]
*  If they have, they haven't told me. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1877.96s)]
*  So you dated a few of them, and what were the dates from those few? [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1881.6000000000001s)]
*  They went from as recent as 3,000 years ago to 22,000 years ago. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1885.78s)]
*  And the reason this site is so interesting to them is because it's all from one little [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1893.4s)]
*  area. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1899.08s)]
*  So the context is there. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1900.72s)]
*  And it spans what's called the extinction event. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1903.44s)]
*  Graham is on Randall. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1908.3200000000002s)]
*  The Younger Dryas Impact Theory. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1911.16s)]
*  And so I'm kind of going along with them. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1913.68s)]
*  That would make sense why they're all there. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1916.56s)]
*  Well you've got to remember that the world, the Pleistocene started what, two and a half [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1919.6000000000001s)]
*  million years ago. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1923.76s)]
*  And stopped about 11,800 years ago. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1925.88s)]
*  So that whole area was ice, except for an ice-free corridor between Siberia and Alaska [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1930.14s)]
*  in the lower 48. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1936.5800000000002s)]
*  They went right through where we're at. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1937.5800000000002s)]
*  So there was migration happening coming through there. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1940.5200000000002s)]
*  And these animals lived there for tens of thousands of years. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1944.5s)]
*  The grazers. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1950.46s)]
*  Well, wherever there's grazers, there's going to be carnivores. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1951.46s)]
*  You have the short-faced bear, you've got the cave lions. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1955.66s)]
*  We found all that stuff. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1959.62s)]
*  You found short-faced bears? [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1960.82s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1962.1s)]
*  Really? [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1963.1s)]
*  You got a short-faced bear head? [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1964.1s)]
*  Yes. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1965.62s)]
*  What does that look like? [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1966.62s)]
*  It's huge. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1968.3799999999999s)]
*  How big is it? [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1969.3799999999999s)]
*  Right about that long. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1971.3799999999999s)]
*  When they stood up on their hind legs, they were 12 feet. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1974.6999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, we've shown photos of these replicas standing next to people. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1977.26s)]
*  Yeah, no, they're huge. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1981.54s)]
*  Nuts. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1983.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1984.54s)]
*  You have a little mini-factoid for you. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1986.46s)]
*  It takes a mammal 21 seconds to take a leak. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1989.58s)]
*  Did you know that? [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1993.3799999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1994.3799999999999s)]
*  Check it out. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1995.3799999999999s)]
*  By the way, I hope you have your bullshit detector on. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1996.3799999999999s)]
*  I know you got one. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=1998.6599999999999s)]
*  And any time you want to throw it on, you throw it on me. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2000.1399999999999s)]
*  I believe you. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2002.3799999999999s)]
*  No, I'm just telling you. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2003.3799999999999s)]
*  Some of this stuff sounds no fucking way. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2005.8999999999999s)]
*  There it goes. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2008.8999999999999s)]
*  20 seconds. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2009.8999999999999s)]
*  Empty their bladders in about 20 seconds. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2010.8999999999999s)]
*  That's the golden rule. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2014.86s)]
*  All mammals weighing more than 2.2 pounds empty their full bladders in about 20 seconds. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2016.9399999999998s)]
*  Unless you've been drinking. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2022.3799999999999s)]
*  I've gone 100 seconds before. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2023.3799999999999s)]
*  I bet you have. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2025.6599999999999s)]
*  It's kind of a contest. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2028.6599999999999s)]
*  So anyways, you've got to remember also that a grizzly bear can cover about 100 yards in [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2033.8999999999999s)]
*  8 seconds. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2038.8999999999999s)]
*  And they've got some pretty powerful noses on them. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2040.86s)]
*  So all these animals that stop to take a piss, they get whacked. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2043.34s)]
*  That's my theory. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2047.74s)]
*  I don't think that's a good theory. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2048.74s)]
*  It probably not. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2050.74s)]
*  I have another theory though that I discovered in Florida. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2051.74s)]
*  What? [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2055.42s)]
*  Pelicans flying groups of prime mummers. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2056.42s)]
*  They do? [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2059.46s)]
*  Seems like that to me. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2062.14s)]
*  I pay attention to shit like that, Joe. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2063.14s)]
*  If you say, look, there's a group of eight pelicans flying over there. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2065.38s)]
*  So bullshit, there's one and then there's seven behind it. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2069.74s)]
*  There, there's 23 of them. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2073.74s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2077.74s)]
*  Prime number. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2078.74s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2079.74s)]
*  But I threw that out on my Instagram one time to challenge people. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2080.74s)]
*  Go find a group of pelicans flying in an odd number. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2086.22s)]
*  And it was kind of hard for them. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2093.3399999999997s)]
*  So you ain't got pelicans around here, but... [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2096.66s)]
*  No, I'm not a fan. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2100.2999999999997s)]
*  You ever see pelicans swallow seagulls? [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2102.5s)]
*  They just grab a seagull, swallow it whole. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2105.02s)]
*  They're ruthless motherfuckers. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2108.14s)]
*  Oh, they are. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2109.14s)]
*  Like people think of pelicans, oh, they carry, it's like a stork. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2110.14s)]
*  They carry the baby. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2113.7799999999997s)]
*  Those are big birds. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2114.7799999999997s)]
*  No, that thing is to swallow giant things. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2116.98s)]
*  That's why their mouth is so big. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2120.2999999999997s)]
*  I saw a pelican last year. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2121.66s)]
*  Drew was with me and it has a fish stuck sideways in its gullet. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2123.2999999999997s)]
*  He couldn't hack it out. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2128.9399999999996s)]
*  He couldn't get it out. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2129.9399999999996s)]
*  And there went another pelican around there to help it put his beak in there and pull [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2130.9399999999996s)]
*  it out. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2134.8599999999997s)]
*  I mean, this thing was gagging on it. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2135.8599999999997s)]
*  Don't even know what happened to them. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2138.2999999999997s)]
*  They probably figured it out. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2139.7s)]
*  You'd think. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2141.58s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, they're evolutionarily designed to swallow enormous things. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2142.58s)]
*  Just think they were they were goddamn dinosaurs about 60 million years ago. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2147.5s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2151.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2153.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2154.34s)]
*  So it's a it's a wild place. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2155.34s)]
*  So this mass extinction event theory does explain why there would be so many all in [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2157.66s)]
*  this one area. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2163.98s)]
*  If they all died very quickly and then they just got sunk into the muck and permafrost. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2166.02s)]
*  So the the Randall Carlson, Graham Hancock theory, which is not really their theory, [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2172.46s)]
*  it's an actual scientific theory called the Younger Dryas Impact Theory that says that [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2177.14s)]
*  there's a certain period of time somewhere around between twelve thousand eight hundred [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2182.6600000000003s)]
*  years ago. And then Graham thinks it's probably happened multiple times since then, maybe [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2188.7000000000003s)]
*  not as big or maybe but similar impacts. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2194.38s)]
*  Well, we pass through this comet cloud and the United States, which was covered in, you [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2197.5400000000004s)]
*  know, half a mile of ice or as much as a mile high of ice, half the half the country. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2205.0200000000004s)]
*  All that was wiped out almost instantaneously and that these things hit all over the world, [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2210.2599999999998s)]
*  probably reset civilization and probably cause the mass extinction of in North America was [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2217.4199999999996s)]
*  like 65 percent of the megafauna died very quickly. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2222.98s)]
*  Geologically speaking, real quick. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2226.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. But to add a little interest to our site, you know, we do have excavators, we [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2230.18s)]
*  do dig around, we'd have mining, gravel operations and stuff like that. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2236.78s)]
*  But in the boneyard, we use the excavators primarily to keep the drains open. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2240.86s)]
*  And we were digging one day and we found burnt bedrock. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2246.98s)]
*  And you've probably seen a picture of that. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2252.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. But the bedrock is actually burned. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2254.3s)]
*  I mean, you can tell it's burned. It's rubbed. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2258.7400000000002s)]
*  It's got charcoal. I mean, it's like. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2260.9s)]
*  And then the gravels right above it are burned. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2262.3s)]
*  Now, to go along with that theory, we had sea levels that rose three to four hundred [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2267.26s)]
*  feet in a relatively short period of time. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2275.98s)]
*  And Beringia, which was that land bridge that came across, suddenly it was no longer a [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2278.54s)]
*  land bridge. It was underwater. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2283.94s)]
*  Worldwide sea levels rose three to four hundred feet around the globe. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2285.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, quickly. Real quick. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2289.86s)]
*  And might have been quicker than the megafauna could adopt to. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2292.38s)]
*  Megafauna had to have. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2297.5800000000004s)]
*  They had to have the right ecosystem to live in and it changed too quick and they [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2301.2200000000003s)]
*  couldn't adopt. That's my theory. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2306.2200000000003s)]
*  Adapt. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2307.9s)]
*  Adapt. Yeah. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2308.9s)]
*  Yeah. So that's probably part of it, too, right? [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2309.78s)]
*  Because some of the things probably survived. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2314.46s)]
*  They think a lot of things died on the impacts or during the floods and during. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2316.6200000000003s)]
*  If you found charcoal, I mean, they found this stuff that they call nuclear glass. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2321.3s)]
*  It's called the Trinitite. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2327.46s)]
*  I believe this way, the way they pronounce it. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2329.1800000000003s)]
*  But it's the same sort of material they found during the Trinity explosion, which is [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2332.1400000000003s)]
*  like from the immense impact of the explosion, it turns sand and, you know, [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2336.78s)]
*  particles into glass. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2342.54s)]
*  And they found they find that all around the world at that same when they do core [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2344.38s)]
*  samples of that same time period. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2348.26s)]
*  And so if there's impacts like that, there's most likely fires. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2350.46s)]
*  And so there's probably that's probably what you're looking at. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2354.86s)]
*  It could be. It could be. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2357.7400000000002s)]
*  Or it could be some other sort of mass fire that hit that area. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2358.98s)]
*  But it's under 60 feet of silt, 10 to 15 feet of gravel. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2362.34s)]
*  And where this is located is the whitest pastry in the interior. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2369.34s)]
*  It's about a mile wide, this pastry where the gold is. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2375.7000000000003s)]
*  The mountains used to be, you know, a couple of few thousand feet taller than they [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2379.2200000000003s)]
*  are right now, where the pay was coming out of that host rock. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2384.2200000000003s)]
*  And gold's got a specific gravity of 19, meaning it'll displace itself 19 times in [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2388.5400000000004s)]
*  water. So that's how sluice boxes work. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2393.98s)]
*  Gold pans, you mix the dirt with the water, the gold goes right to the bottom. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2398.98s)]
*  Same way of the pastry. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2403.94s)]
*  The gold's moving down the creek. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2406.46s)]
*  It goes deeper and deeper and deeper. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2407.78s)]
*  The gravel goes over the top of it pretty soon. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2409.1s)]
*  It hits bedrock. You can't go any deeper. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2410.86s)]
*  That's where it stays. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2413.58s)]
*  And the gravel just keeps moving down. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2414.9s)]
*  So there was a lot of water that went through this valley. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2417.54s)]
*  This creek there now is not 15 feet wide, but the valley itself with the pay gravels [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2419.46s)]
*  is a mile wide. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2425.38s)]
*  Wow. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2426.94s)]
*  And there's gold throughout the whole thing. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2428.38s)]
*  So at one point in time, there could have been a river that's a mile wide that was [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2430.82s)]
*  running through there. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2434.1s)]
*  Could have been. I don't know. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2434.9s)]
*  And these animals that they said that aren't supposed to be there. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2437.5s)]
*  What animals are those? [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2441.3s)]
*  Dire wolves being one of them. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2443.06s)]
*  Dire wolves. You found dire wolves? [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2444.54s)]
*  Dire wolves. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2446.34s)]
*  Do you have photos of this stuff? [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2447.1800000000003s)]
*  Is it all up on your Instagram? [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2449.34s)]
*  Yeah. Well, Jamie's looking. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2450.82s)]
*  There might be some on that on my page. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2454.5s)]
*  So when you found dire wolves, like in what condition? [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2458.54s)]
*  Just the bones? [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2461.3s)]
*  You found some tissue, too, which is kind of crazy. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2462.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Like a lot of these animals died and you found little pieces of soft tissue [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2465.8599999999997s)]
*  and tendons and ligaments, which those paleontologists were thrilled by. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2471.8199999999997s)]
*  They couldn't believe it. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2476.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. They had bones with marrow still in them. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2477.2999999999997s)]
*  Wow. And there's the carnivores had pretty strong jaws. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2481.62s)]
*  They like the marrow. That might explain why so many bones are broken where they're [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2487.3399999999997s)]
*  broken. You know, they chewed into these animals. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2491.78s)]
*  And one of the other extinct, not just dead, but extinct animals we found up there [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2495.02s)]
*  is we've never found elk before. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2503.1400000000003s)]
*  Well, we found some elk, but the experts say they didn't exist up there. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2507.5800000000004s)]
*  And I know you're you'd like to hunt elk and eat elk. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2512.0600000000004s)]
*  But elk exist in Alaska. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2515.7000000000003s)]
*  They exist down. I think they do. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2519.6200000000003s)]
*  They do. They do. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2521.38s)]
*  So that's a dire wolf skull. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2523.0200000000004s)]
*  Yeah. Wow. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2524.34s)]
*  They have Roosevelt elk in Alaska. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2526.42s)]
*  They have them on some of the islands on the coast. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2529.82s)]
*  A Fog Nack. A Fog Nack has Roosevelt elk on it because it's a it's a very difficult [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2534.5800000000004s)]
*  hunt that people go on. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2540.42s)]
*  And the problem is there's enormous brown bears on there. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2542.2200000000003s)]
*  And my friend Steve Rinella told a story on the podcast of how they shot an elk up [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2544.94s)]
*  there. And it's an incredibly difficult hike in and hike out. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2549.54s)]
*  You go into very thick brush and terrain at a very steep angle. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2553.62s)]
*  It's very hard to get through with anything. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2559.7s)]
*  So they take this elk, they hang it in a tree and they start they come back the next [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2561.98s)]
*  day to start to cut it up and to take it apart. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2569.7s)]
*  But by the time they get back, a bear has already claimed it. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2572.7s)]
*  And they don't know this yet. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2575.1s)]
*  And they get rushed by this bear. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2576.94s)]
*  He said it's the crazy. It ran straight through their camp, but it found so many people [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2579.7000000000003s)]
*  didn't know exactly what to do. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2583.5s)]
*  And it ran through. One of their guys winds up on top of the bear's back somehow. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2585.1800000000003s)]
*  So it literally plows through the camp and he's riding this bear's back for like 15, [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2590.98s)]
*  20 yards and then falls off the bear's back. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2596.02s)]
*  The bear runs into the woods and the bears huffing at him. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2598.7000000000003s)]
*  And then they get out the rifles like they were eating lunch. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2601.02s)]
*  They had no idea. So there are elk up there. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2603.6200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. But they're not in the interior. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2606.06s)]
*  And we're which is crazy because they're on the island. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2609.06s)]
*  Like how are they on a Fog Nack if they're not in the interior? [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2612.06s)]
*  How did they get on that island? [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2614.34s)]
*  How did little mini mammoths get down to one of the islands on the southeast? [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2616.3s)]
*  They say little these miniature mammoths lived there till three, four thousand years ago. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2621.34s)]
*  That's interesting. That's island dwarfism. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2626.06s)]
*  Right. That happens with elephants too. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2628.2200000000003s)]
*  When elephants live in an island, they get smaller. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2630.26s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2632.46s)]
*  Yeah. No, there's a mystery up here. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2634.06s)]
*  And so is that one you found? [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2636.14s)]
*  That's not one we found. That's one they found in Siberia. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2639.3s)]
*  Oh, but the same sort of situation. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2641.98s)]
*  Yeah. We found one frost is melting and that one actually has tissue all over it. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2644.9s)]
*  Yeah. We have we have a specimen that was found called Effie for Fairbanks exploration. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2648.86s)]
*  It's a mammoth trunk and his leg and his skull cap and stuff. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2655.86s)]
*  We have we have found a lot over the years and they all you know, there was a deal with AMNH. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2661.7799999999997s)]
*  You might have heard me rant about that a little. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2670.34s)]
*  No. What's AMNH? [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2672.98s)]
*  Alaska American Museum of Natural History. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2674.7799999999997s)]
*  Back in 1920s, when the company started hydraulicking, they started unearthing all these fossils. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2678.38s)]
*  The company had eight bucket line dredges running. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2686.9s)]
*  So they were moving millions of yards. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2690.3s)]
*  They moved two hundred and seventy seven million yards of silt hydraulically, which was just 17 million more yards than they dug out of the Panama Canal. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2692.7000000000003s)]
*  And so all those bones, there was a guy named Childs Frick in New York. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2708.06s)]
*  His father was Henry Frick, the U.S. Steel Magnet with Carnegie. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2713.58s)]
*  They decided to get a hold of the USS R&M Company in Boston. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2718.82s)]
*  They said, hey, how about we finance to get these bones out of Alaska and bring them to AMNH? [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2724.42s)]
*  So they worked a three way deal with the University of Alaska Fairbanks. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2731.1000000000004s)]
*  President Bunnell up there and a guy named Otto Geist started going out with a bone wagon. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2735.42s)]
*  They collected bones for from 1928 till 1958. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2741.6600000000003s)]
*  Now, they were only supposed to collect scientifically important bones. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2746.6200000000003s)]
*  And for those, they were supposed to do research on them and write reports and submit them to my company. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2751.9s)]
*  Well, they didn't do that. They collected the bones, sent them to New York City. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2757.78s)]
*  Where they just languished in the basements of the AMNH. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2763.94s)]
*  When I bought the company, I started going through my files and I found this deal. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2769.5800000000004s)]
*  And I got a hold of the University of Alaska and I said, these are our company bones. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2774.26s)]
*  Let's go find out what's going on with them. They haven't done the reporting they're supposed to. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2780.1400000000003s)]
*  So myself, along with a guy named, I got the reports right here, Dick Osborne, who was the author of this report. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2785.5800000000004s)]
*  I'm going to give you this report, by the way, because I've told everybody that I'm going to start a bone rush. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2799.1s)]
*  A bone rush? [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2807.62s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2808.46s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2810.2599999999998s)]
*  Well, they took 500,000 or so bones from Fairbanks to New York City, left them in the crates. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2811.2599999999998s)]
*  And there's a picture on there someplace when I went there to visit in crates that have yet to be open. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2822.42s)]
*  But in the 40s, they took about a whole boxcar load of these bones. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2829.58s)]
*  They ran out of storage and they dumped them in the East River. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2838.46s)]
*  What? [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2842.5s)]
*  In the East River. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2843.2999999999997s)]
*  And I've told everybody that, again, with Joe Rogan, the only place I'm going to divulge that location. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2845.2599999999998s)]
*  So all that stuff in those pictures is all from your property? [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2852.1s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2854.94s)]
*  What a crazy piece of land you stumbled upon. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2855.78s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2858.78s)]
*  And so they dumped how much in the East River? [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2860.46s)]
*  I'm told by Dick Osborne, a boxcar load, 50,000 or 50 tons. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2863.7400000000002s)]
*  Just threw it in the water? [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2868.78s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2870.02s)]
*  Is it still there? [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2871.02s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2872.6600000000003s)]
*  Could it be still there? [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2874.2200000000003s)]
*  Could be. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2875.46s)]
*  Some of it, maybe? [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2876.46s)]
*  Certainly the tusks. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2878.02s)]
*  Do you know where it was? [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2879.2200000000003s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2880.38s)]
*  So you're going to hire some divers? [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2882.1800000000003s)]
*  So you're going to hire some divers? [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2883.62s)]
*  What are you going to do? [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2885.14s)]
*  I've told... [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2886.86s)]
*  You have a lot of people that follow you on your Instagram. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2888.5s)]
*  I got a lot of people that follow me, thanks to you. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2890.98s)]
*  And I said, you know, those bones, as far as I'm concerned, that they dumped in the East River, they're no longer mine. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2895.66s)]
*  They're finder's keepers. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2903.02s)]
*  So if any of you guys want to go out and find some bones, I'll tell you exactly where the fuck they're at. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2905.02s)]
*  But I'll only tell Joe Rogan. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2910.74s)]
*  So I have to tell people? [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2914.34s)]
*  Tell them right now. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2916.7s)]
*  Okay, tell them right now. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2917.58s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2918.7799999999997s)]
*  Where is it? [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2919.34s)]
*  Do you know what street they pulled up to where they dumped them off? [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2921.1s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2923.74s)]
*  Really? [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2924.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2924.98s)]
*  Would you like to announce it to everybody? [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2926.62s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2928.1s)]
*  You do it. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2928.46s)]
*  You want me to? [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2930.02s)]
*  Yeah, please. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2930.66s)]
*  Okay. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2931.7s)]
*  Only makes sense. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2932.18s)]
*  Imagine, imagine you see a bunch of divers pulling wooly mammoth tusks out of the East River. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2935.66s)]
*  The title of this draft report is early man in Eastern Beringia, late Pleistocene and early Holocene, artifacts and associated fauna recovered from Fairbanks Mining District, Alaska. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2942.18s)]
*  Authored by Richard Osborne, the Coordinary Center, University of Alaska Museum, Professor Emeritus, University of Wisconsin-Madison. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2956.3799999999997s)]
*  Robert Evander, vertebrate paleontology, American Museum of Natural History, and a fellow named Robert Sattler, Tanana Chiefs, Fairbanks, Alaska. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2964.18s)]
*  They wrote the introduction and the report, this associated draft never released goes through the history of the bone collecting in Alaska, at least off my ground. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2974.66s)]
*  So the part that I want to reveal to people, because I said I would, we'll see if anybody's out there got a sense of adventure. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=2989.02s)]
*  Because if I was, and I'm not going to tell people you're allowed to do this, but if I was listening to your podcast and I happen to have a boat and I happen to have a scuba, little scuba equipment, because I'm gonna tell them everybody right now where the fuck they're at. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3000.78s)]
*  Where the fuck are they? [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3017.42s)]
*  Okay. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3018.4199999999996s)]
*  Looking for the address? [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3031.9399999999996s)]
*  No, I'm just gonna take the part off where I had this posted on my Instagram, it was redacted where the location was. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3033.4599999999996s)]
*  Because I want to make sure everybody in the world has a chance to hear it at the same time. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3043.06s)]
*  Okay. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3046.7s)]
*  Because this is gonna be a bone rush. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3047.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3049.34s)]
*  Okay. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3051.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3057.74s)]
*  So here we go. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3058.14s)]
*  Alright, here we go. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3058.94s)]
*  Mistakes made in the field as to acceptable condition of the large, of the bone shipped to New York City were dumped in the East River. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3062.58s)]
*  Okay. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3070.9s)]
*  The dump site at that time was off. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3072.14s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3075.2999999999997s)]
*  No, it's redacted. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3075.94s)]
*  Here I'm gonna read what's redacted. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3077.5s)]
*  Okay. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3078.86s)]
*  The dump site was off. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3079.74s)]
*  The East River Drive at about 65th Street. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3081.46s)]
*  The common New York City hospital dump site as well for difficult to dispose of materials. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3087.22s)]
*  Potentially a challenging archaeological dig for archaeologists in the distant future. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3094.14s)]
*  Now, I'm gonna say this about that. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3100.06s)]
*  These bones that we find, they're paleontological in nature. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3102.4199999999996s)]
*  Archaeology is a study of human stuff. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3108.02s)]
*  What happened there? [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3113.66s)]
*  Did they mix a bunch of the bones in with a bunch of the stuff from the hospital? [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3114.8599999999997s)]
*  Is there stuff in the hospital? [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3119.1s)]
*  Or is there even more stuff from the, from AM&H that was dumped there that they didn't have room to store? [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3121.3799999999997s)]
*  Like human stuff. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3127.14s)]
*  Could be human stuff. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3128.2999999999997s)]
*  I just can't imagine that they just didn't have any room for it. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3129.38s)]
*  So they dumped valuable bones. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3131.9s)]
*  They were of no value to these guys. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3135.3s)]
*  That is so crazy. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3137.7400000000002s)]
*  But you got to remember this was in 1928 to 1958. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3139.02s)]
*  People, you know, miners didn't collect the bones. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3145.2200000000003s)]
*  That's what makes me such an oddball. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3148.02s)]
*  I have friends going, when I first started this 15 years ago, going, what the fuck are you doing? [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3150.78s)]
*  There's a lot of garbage in the dump site. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3156.62s)]
*  There's a lot of gold under those. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3158.94s)]
*  Go get the gold. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3161.18s)]
*  Right. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3162.42s)]
*  The bones, man. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3163.5s)]
*  We've got to get the bones and we'll get the gold. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3164.34s)]
*  Don't worry about it. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3166.1s)]
*  So 15 years later, I'm saying, we'll get the goddamn gold. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3167.78s)]
*  Don't worry about it. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3172.42s)]
*  I take a, I take a pretty long view of history and I appreciate your view of history. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3173.54s)]
*  And I'll tell you something else about history. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3178.66s)]
*  History is just not about what happened in the past. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3181.02s)]
*  History is about what's about to fucking happen. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3185.66s)]
*  No, what we just talked about is about to happen. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3189.46s)]
*  Now people are going to go and they're going to go, he just told us where the, where it is. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3193.58s)]
*  You can pull it up on Google earth and find that site. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3198.2599999999998s)]
*  And how far into the water was it? [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3201.46s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3203.2999999999997s)]
*  Did they dump it off of boats? [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3204.46s)]
*  Did they dump it right off the shore? [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3205.9s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3208.3799999999997s)]
*  How wide is the East river? [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3210.02s)]
*  The dump site at the time was off the East river drive at about 65th street. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3212.0600000000004s)]
*  So that ain't that wide. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3219.02s)]
*  Is that right? [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3221.6200000000003s)]
*  Is that what I'm looking at? [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3222.1000000000004s)]
*  Is this 65th street? [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3222.7400000000002s)]
*  This East river drive? [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3223.82s)]
*  I think so. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3224.6600000000003s)]
*  It says right there, 53rd street tunnel. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3225.26s)]
*  So that's the neighborhood. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3227.5s)]
*  So there's 65th street. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3229.86s)]
*  And so somewhere right off of that. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3231.9s)]
*  I'd say right, right alongside. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3235.34s)]
*  Cause right here is a train bridge. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3236.98s)]
*  Do you know how crazy it would be if there's fucking mammoth bones right there in the East [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3239.3399999999997s)]
*  river, tusks right there in the East river. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3244.2999999999997s)]
*  Dude, let me tell you something about mammoth bones, mammoth tusks. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3248.98s)]
*  They're extremely valuable and a complete set of tusks. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3254.54s)]
*  Like the day, did you see that little video snippet? [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3259.5s)]
*  I said about the day we found a full grown, wooly mammoth. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3263.5s)]
*  I mean, all of it. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3267.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3269.1s)]
*  Yeah, I did see that. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3269.66s)]
*  Well, and thousands of thousands of bones within a week and another mammoth the next [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3270.74s)]
*  day, tusks don't float. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3277.9s)]
*  They don't roll along the bottom. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3281.3399999999997s)]
*  They sit where they're at. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3283.42s)]
*  They're curved. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3285.54s)]
*  They weigh a lot. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3286.62s)]
*  They're very dense. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3287.2599999999998s)]
*  Same with the leg bones. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3289.18s)]
*  They're dense too. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3290.46s)]
*  I don't know what kind of current that river has, if even has a current. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3291.94s)]
*  All I know is this is where they say they dumped them. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3295.7799999999997s)]
*  And I got to go with that. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3298.5400000000004s)]
*  This is where they say they dumped them. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3301.1400000000003s)]
*  This is where they dumped them. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3303.1000000000004s)]
*  So all it would take is just a well-heeled expedition of guys who know how to scuba. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3304.98s)]
*  Yeah, I wouldn't even be well-heeled. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3313.5s)]
*  I, you know, you can take an underwater camera and drop it over with your fishing pole. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3315.9s)]
*  Or like they have those underwater drones now too. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3320.5800000000004s)]
*  And they got the side scanning sonar and stuff that you can use. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3323.3s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3329.1000000000004s)]
*  We've tried looking at using those kinds of things at the boneyard, but they can't [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3330.54s)]
*  pick up tusks buried 10 feet down. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3335.7400000000002s)]
*  You know, they shoot pulses into the earth and it's supposed to refract back up. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3340.02s)]
*  You just got to find them where they're at. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3345.6200000000003s)]
*  And I was going to tell you how valuable these tusks are. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3347.42s)]
*  The set we found on the day, we had an offer for $485,000 for the pair the next day. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3352.42s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3359.9s)]
*  And guess what, Joe? [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3361.02s)]
*  You and I both know what $485,000 looks like. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3363.42s)]
*  What would you rather look at? [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3367.1000000000004s)]
*  Set a 12 foot mammoth tusk or a bunch of hondos sitting on a... [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3369.38s)]
*  Depends on what phase of my life I'm at. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3375.58s)]
*  Yeah, well, I think at this point in your life, you'd rather look [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3378.1400000000003s)]
*  at the tusks. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3382.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3383.14s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3383.7799999999997s)]
*  12 foot tusks? [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3384.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3385.8999999999996s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3386.4599999999996s)]
*  But I'm not inter... [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3387.7s)]
*  I want to see the tusks. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3388.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3390.06s)]
*  Now, I don't have as many sunsets in front of me as I do behind me, but I have an [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3390.3799999999997s)]
*  idea I won't have to sell those in my lifetime. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3396.74s)]
*  I'll let Drew out there and Allora decide what happens to those things. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3400.58s)]
*  We just built our own, you know, they said, well, storage is a problem. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3405.8999999999996s)]
*  We just built this fall before we came down here, framed up a 5,000 square foot [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3408.58s)]
*  building to house some of the collection. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3413.7799999999997s)]
*  We have so many bones. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3417.9s)]
*  I've filled up four vans, delivery trucks, big, you know, semi trailer filled. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3419.66s)]
*  Started off with, eh, we got a few. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3426.38s)]
*  Now we got a few hundred thousand. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3429.86s)]
*  And you're not even done, ding it. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3431.62s)]
*  Oh, fuck no. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3433.42s)]

*  Thank you. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3455.2999999999997s)]
*  Tell people, go get it. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3458.34s)]
*  Go get them tusks. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3459.8199999999997s)]
*  I mean, you know how amazing it would be if someone came on? [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3461.54s)]
*  Tell you what, if somebody goes there and they gets a tusk, I'll have you on the podcast. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3464.2599999999998s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3469.02s)]
*  They're, uh, buddy of mine just sold a broken tusk for a hundred thousand bucks. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3469.8199999999997s)]
*  That's wild. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3476.8199999999997s)]
*  So, I mean, they're not making any new ones. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3477.9s)]
*  It's just weird that you could even own them. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3480.66s)]
*  You know, like, I know a guy who, uh, was on a ranch in Montana and, um, um, I [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3483.18s)]
*  think the story was someone was elk hunting on the ranch and they saw something in the [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3492.66s)]
*  ground and they contacted the ranch owner and it turned out there was a T-Rex skeleton [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3496.86s)]
*  and they, someone purchased it for over a million dollars. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3502.86s)]
*  Yep. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3506.06s)]
*  Uh, there's a guy on Instagram. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3507.94s)]
*  I want to say Bucky the fingerlets or something like that. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3511.78s)]
*  That found. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3515.7000000000003s)]
*  He should get together with Dick mole. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3516.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3518.6600000000003s)]
*  But he, uh, found the best preserved T-Rex I think ever found on his ranch or in the, [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3519.7400000000002s)]

*  I was scared to ask because it looks like you just have so many stack. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3818.7799999999997s)]
*  What's in that box right there that where it looks like skin below that, Jamie? [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3822.3799999999997s)]
*  There's a short, yeah, that's a, what is that? [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3827.2599999999998s)]
*  I think that's a caribou. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3829.42s)]
*  Wow. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3831.18s)]
*  A mummified caribou. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3831.8999999999996s)]
*  We find horses. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3834.94s)]
*  We found a different species of horse. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3835.8199999999997s)]
*  What? [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3837.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3838.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3839.22s)]
*  The Harrington horse. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3839.8199999999997s)]
*  We found that paleontologist come on court when they see shit like that. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3841.9s)]
*  Cause it's not supposed to be there either. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3845.9s)]
*  They've never found them in, they found them in the Yukon, but they didn't. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3848.9s)]
*  What do they base whether or not an animal lived there on? [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3854.42s)]
*  Is it whether or not they found bones of them? [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3858.42s)]
*  And when you're dealing with something that's 20,000 years ago, how do they really [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3861.38s)]
*  know what was where unless they find a dead one? [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3865.02s)]
*  Well, how do you know what they're telling you is the truth? [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3868.5800000000004s)]
*  How do they know what the truth is? [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3871.3s)]
*  They don't, but they're in a business. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3872.98s)]
*  They, yeah, this happened 20,000 years ago and I've got a doctorate in this field. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3874.46s)]
*  So that's what happened. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3879.1000000000004s)]
*  Right. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3880.1000000000004s)]
*  But they're only basing it on evidence that's been discovered. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3880.26s)]
*  And when you have a place like yours, we're discovering an insane amount of new [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3882.9s)]
*  evidence, you could literally rewrite paleontological history. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3886.2200000000003s)]
*  I can't. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3891.3s)]
*  No, they can't, but your place can't. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3892.3s)]
*  Well, it looks like now I'm going to have to accommodate somebody. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3894.86s)]
*  It's only going to happen if Joe Rogan's involved. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3897.46s)]
*  So how many people do you have that are paleontologists that are involved in this? [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3901.34s)]
*  Zero. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3907.46s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3908.2200000000003s)]
*  That's insane. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3910.6200000000003s)]
*  Here's the qualifications. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3912.38s)]

*  No, I have not. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3916.38s)]

*  And if you do, I want you to come up in the fall so you can go moose hunting. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3919.2200000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3923.3s)]
*  Have you tipped them? [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3923.98s)]
*  You ever tipped a moose over? [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3924.82s)]

*  Do you like moose meat? [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3928.0600000000004s)]
*  I love it. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3929.1800000000003s)]
*  We'll put you on your own creek. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3929.9s)]
*  We'll give you a four-wheeler, a truck, or whatever you need. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3931.46s)]
*  Come up, bag a moose, take you to the boneyard. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3934.5s)]
*  Within minutes, you will be a boner. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3939.46s)]

*  I'm sure. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3945.2200000000003s)]

*  That's incredible. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3954.38s)]
*  And Dick Mole. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3955.02s)]
*  Do we have to be called boners? [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3956.7s)]
*  Yeah, you have to, Jamie. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3961.02s)]
*  Don't be scared of a name. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3962.3799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, no. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3964.06s)]
*  Well, my kids are all master boners because in order to be a master boner, you got to [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3964.7s)]
*  find 10,000 of them. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3970.58s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3972.1s)]
*  You're not going to be there long enough to find 10,000. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3972.8599999999997s)]
*  No. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3975.14s)]
*  Do you got a lot of moose up there? [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3975.66s)]
*  A lot of moose. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3976.98s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3988.4199999999996s)]
*  Moose. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3991.3399999999997s)]
*  When we bag a moose, we want to make sure it's near someplace we can get a front end [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=3998.7s)]
*  loader to. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4002.54s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4003.18s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4003.8999999999996s)]
*  You don't want to try to shoot. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4004.66s)]
*  I shot one off Yukon in the Hanzana River once and it fell into the river. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4007.2599999999998s)]
*  Oh my goodness. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4012.18s)]
*  Right as the sunset. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4013.14s)]
*  How'd you get them out? [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4014.46s)]
*  I tried to chop them up in half with an axe underwater. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4016.2999999999997s)]
*  It didn't work. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4018.94s)]
*  Spent the night on a gravel bar. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4020.42s)]
*  The guys I had upstream, they got caught in the dark and they didn't come floating down [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4022.46s)]
*  till the next day. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4026.62s)]
*  So I started a fire by the bank and they finally came down and we got it out. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4027.2999999999997s)]
*  I'd prefer a road hunt. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4034.22s)]
*  A buddy of mine had the same thing happen last year. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4035.9399999999996s)]
*  He shot a moose and it ran into the river and died in the river. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4038.18s)]
*  And they're like, fuck. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4042.3799999999997s)]
*  2,000 pound animal. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4044.8999999999996s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4046.46s)]
*  No, that's horrible. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4046.8999999999996s)]
*  And that happens. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4047.8599999999997s)]
*  But they're so unusual. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4048.58s)]
*  Like when you see them, they don't look real. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4052.18s)]
*  Like they're so big and you see these goddamn barn doors coming off the side of their [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4054.9399999999996s)]
*  heads. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4060.98s)]
*  Like that is a real animal. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4061.46s)]
*  And you shoot one of those. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4063.9399999999996s)]
*  You're eating good meat for a year. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4065.18s)]
*  Every day you could have moose meat for a year. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4068.1s)]
*  It's incredible. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4070.8599999999997s)]
*  I let guys, I have different areas and I have one group of guys that likes to go to the [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4072.02s)]
*  certain areas. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4077.3799999999997s)]
*  So my rule is you can hunt there, but I get a quarter of whatever. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4078.06s)]
*  Nice. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4082.3399999999997s)]
*  That's a good deal. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4082.94s)]
*  Every time they, if they get a moose, I get a quarter of it. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4083.58s)]
*  And then another group, same thing. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4086.8599999999997s)]
*  So last year I got five quarters of moose and I really went hunting. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4088.3399999999997s)]
*  Wow. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4092.3s)]
*  But it helps me. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4092.94s)]
*  I give the moose away to, you know, I got out of the pioneers or some food bank or [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4094.26s)]
*  someplace. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4098.9400000000005s)]
*  Oh, that's nice. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4099.54s)]
*  Pass a little bit of around the guys that can't hunt anymore that are no longer able [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4100.3s)]
*  to go hunting. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4104.58s)]
*  I'll take some, give them some moose meat. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4105.1s)]
*  That's nice. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4106.7s)]
*  And we always have a freezer full of it just in case. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4107.46s)]
*  It's so good for you. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4110.9800000000005s)]
*  Oh, that's great. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4112.06s)]
*  It's the best meat, like wild game meat in particular. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4112.66s)]
*  And moose is unusual. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4115.74s)]
*  It's a very different taste and elk, very different than deer. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4116.860000000001s)]
*  It's like similar, but not, you know, I've never had elk. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4119.98s)]
*  It's delicious. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4123.5s)]

*  Okay. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4135.46s)]
*  I'll hook you up. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4135.78s)]
*  Oh, that'd be great. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4136.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4137.5s)]
*  Cause we're going to, I got summer sausage for the plane. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4138.0199999999995s)]
*  You could eat it on the plane flight. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4142.26s)]
*  I got some roasts for you. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4143.74s)]
*  So stakes. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4145.54s)]
*  Don't do all that. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4146.5s)]
*  Come on, man. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4147.34s)]
*  No. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4148.98s)]
*  Take it with you. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4149.38s)]
*  It's the best meat. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4151.34s)]
*  I'll set you up with some moose meat though. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4152.74s)]
*  I'll, I'll send you. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4155.5s)]
*  Just set me up near a moose. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4156.74s)]
*  We'll get her. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4158.18s)]
*  Oh, I'll put you on a moose. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4158.66s)]
*  Are there a lot up there? [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4159.9800000000005s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4160.9400000000005s)]
*  The problem with moose is moose are usually around grizzlies. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4162.1s)]
*  That is a problem. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4167.06s)]
*  That's a fucking big problem. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4170.74s)]
*  I shot a black bear once it was tearing a door off a cabin where my sister was the [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4172.74s)]
*  camp cook. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4177.3s)]
*  Oh boy. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4178.06s)]
*  And the night before I'd seen bear tracks all over the place. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4179.22s)]
*  And I said, I ain't, I'm not going to eat much for dinner. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4182.98s)]
*  I'm just going to be a light sleeper tonight, about three o'clock in the morning. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4185.34s)]
*  I hear this boom, John, boom, another rifle shot. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4189.14s)]
*  I step up. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4193.38s)]
*  My six was right there. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4193.98s)]
*  I blasted that black bear right on the doorstep and wounded it pretty good. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4195.14s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4200.54s)]
*  They die hard, man. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4201.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4202.74s)]
*  They're a, they're a big, strong animal, a big spooky animal. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4202.94s)]
*  And they're not, I mean, black bears, they're not even nearly as big as grizzlies, [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4206.98s)]
*  but they're still terrible. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4211.74s)]
*  They, they sound like a dying man. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4214.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4216.0199999999995s)]
*  If you don't kill them first shot, that's it. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4217.0599999999995s)]
*  They're going, Oh, a buddy of mine, Mike Hawkeridge. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4218.86s)]
*  He's got a place called a BC out for, I think it's a big country outfitters. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4221.94s)]
*  And, uh, I hunted with him up in British Columbia and he had a, one of them was [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4228.099999999999s)]
*  coming into a cabin. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4234.38s)]
*  A grizzly was coming into a cabin. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4236.5s)]
*  He'd literally shot it at the doorstep of the cabin. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4238.46s)]
*  It's like right there coming in and the heat, they're, they're terrifying up there. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4243.42s)]
*  And they, they put a ban on hunting them too, because all the people from Vancouver [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4248.740000000001s)]
*  are like doing killer grizzly. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4252.3s)]
*  They're grizzlies. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4254.34s)]
*  Your friend. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4254.9800000000005s)]
*  It's like the biggest, scariest fucking thing in the woods. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4256.18s)]
*  And it also the wildlife biologists say they have to be managed. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4259.06s)]
*  If you don't manage their population, then they decimate the population of deer [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4262.86s)]
*  and elk and moose and, and everything that lives up there. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4266.26s)]
*  And so there's all these people that understand the balance of nature and these [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4269.3s)]
*  well-trained, well-educated wildlife biologists who make recommendations. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4274.22s)]
*  And then people vote on it, which is crazy because you're having people vote [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4278.58s)]
*  who are never even in the woods. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4282.94s)]
*  You got people voting in Vancouver and they're like, don't kill the bear. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4284.74s)]
*  The bear is your friend. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4288.78s)]
*  We don't want churvy hunters. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4289.82s)]
*  But what they don't understand is like that you're making life extremely difficult [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4292.14s)]
*  for all the people that live up there. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4297.06s)]
*  If you don't manage those populations, you lower the amount of game that are there, [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4298.26s)]
*  the game animals, and also you make it very dangerous for those people, because now [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4302.26s)]
*  those bears are no longer scared of people because they used to associate people with [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4306.38s)]
*  gunshots and fear and, you know, people will hunt them. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4310.46s)]
*  Now they think of people as food. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4313.9s)]
*  When the wolves come into town, if you have a dog out on a train, [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4317.22s)]
*  you go out the next day and all you got is a collar and a head. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4321.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4325.5s)]
*  Wolves are unbelievable hunters. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4326.22s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4328.22s)]
*  They really are. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4329.26s)]
*  I got a couple of creeks with different packs. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4329.9400000000005s)]
*  If they get a moose, they'll camp there for a week and a half eating it. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4333.9s)]
*  That must be so wild to see. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4337.1s)]
*  I was out at one of my creeks. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4340.1s)]
*  There was a calf moose stuck down in a tailing pile. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4342.18s)]
*  Couldn't make up the side of the tailings because they're so loose. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4345.86s)]
*  So I called fish a game. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4349.38s)]
*  I said, there's a calf out here if you want to come rescue it. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4350.42s)]
*  And it was towards the end of the day. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4353.66s)]
*  And they said, nah. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4355.02s)]
*  I said, well, what about tomorrow? [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4356.7s)]
*  He said, it won't be there tomorrow. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4358.14s)]
*  I went out there the next day. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4360.5s)]
*  It was just bones. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4361.58s)]
*  Wolves came in, hit it, ate it. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4363.38s)]
*  How often do you see wolves? [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4365.34s)]
*  All the time. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4367.14s)]
*  That's awesome. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4369.02s)]
*  I got, I got wolves within. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4369.9s)]
*  I see wolves come into the boneyard. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4371.9800000000005s)]
*  Really? [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4374.3s)]
*  Fuck. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4374.82s)]
*  They smell that and they go, it's time to eat. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4375.58s)]
*  Oh, they like that. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4378.54s)]
*  Rotten meat. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4380.26s)]
*  God. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4381.14s)]
*  We got links there that hang out. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4381.860000000001s)]
*  Drew was walking up the draw one day and there he looked up and there's a big links [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4384.02s)]
*  about 15 feet away from just looking at him. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4389.66s)]
*  Like, what the fuck are you doing, man? [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4392.18s)]
*  You coming up here in my neighborhood for, and he kind of backed away. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4394.900000000001s)]
*  And I'm going to get out of here. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4398.7s)]
*  I only saw links once. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4400.46s)]
*  I saw a link in links in Alberta. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4401.7s)]
*  Wild looking cat. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4405.780000000001s)]
*  Cool looking animal. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4407.860000000001s)]
*  Yep. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4408.9400000000005s)]
*  So those wolves, are they ever a threat to people up there? [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4410.26s)]
*  When there's a pack of them, they're a threat to anything. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4415.58s)]
*  You know, they, but they generally don't fuck with people. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4418.22s)]
*  It's hard to see wolves. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4421.54s)]
*  It actually is hard to find them. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4422.900000000001s)]
*  But sometimes like where we're at, you can hear them howling. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4424.900000000001s)]
*  You can, you can, they're actually out there making noise, looking for each other. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4428.7s)]
*  And, you know, we're in their neck of the woods. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4433.46s)]
*  They're not in my neck of the woods. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4435.7s)]
*  You know, suddenly there's a road there and they're going, what the fuck? [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4438.02s)]
*  Put this in here. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4440.9800000000005s)]
*  This is good walking. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4441.780000000001s)]
*  I can walk. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4443.900000000001s)]
*  I got a picture in my phone of a pack of wolves that went by an underground [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4444.54s)]
*  miners, this one on one of my creeks. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4448.860000000001s)]
*  There's, you know, they've got signs up to say no trespassing and all that. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4451.26s)]
*  Wolves are just walking by like, we don't care. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4456.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4458.18s)]
*  Come on. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4458.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4460.740000000001s)]
*  I asked the same guy. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4461.02s)]
*  I said, you never see bears out here. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4461.9400000000005s)]
*  No, this guy did several tours in Vietnam as a sniper because he liked his job. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4464.0599999999995s)]
*  I said, do you see a lot of bears out here? [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4472.62s)]
*  Cause I hate bears. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4476.82s)]
*  I said, have you ever shot one out here? [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4479.58s)]
*  He goes, I've shot 57 of them. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4480.98s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4487.5s)]
*  You probably shouldn't say that on the podcast. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4488.26s)]
*  That guy might be in trouble. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4489.86s)]
*  No. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4491.58s)]
*  No. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4492.54s)]
*  Life and property, man. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4493.82s)]
*  Well, and they will take life and they will take property. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4496.299999999999s)]
*  Yep. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4499.379999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4500.099999999999s)]
*  He, uh, he will take their life. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4500.259999999999s)]
*  He doesn't like them. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4502.54s)]
*  No, I've only shot one bear. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4504.54s)]
*  They tried to shoot a grizzly once and my rifle jammed. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4506.42s)]
*  Have you ever eaten bear? [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4512.7s)]
*  No. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4514.219999999999s)]
*  Tastes good. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4514.66s)]
*  Believe it or not, especially black bear. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4515.46s)]
*  Black bears. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4518.0199999999995s)]
*  Good. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4518.42s)]
*  Black bears. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4519.62s)]
*  Good. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4520.0599999999995s)]
*  Uh, my friend Steve Rinella, um, said that some of the best meat he's ever [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4520.86s)]
*  eaten is black bear that had been eating blueberries. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4524.42s)]
*  Oh, I bet. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4527.0199999999995s)]
*  And he shot them up in Alaska too. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4527.66s)]
*  That's where he got it. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4529.3s)]
*  I would have probably eaten black bear that day. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4531.0199999999995s)]
*  I shot the black bear at the cabin. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4533.9s)]
*  If we had more time, but we were running up to the cut to go to work. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4536.46s)]
*  I cut a couple of his claws off and we buried it. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4540.42s)]
*  Just didn't have time, but he was again, life and property, [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4543.58s)]
*  tearing the door off to get inside where the food was. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4547.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4551.0199999999995s)]
*  Well, they're predatory too. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4551.099999999999s)]
*  They'll kill people. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4552.099999999999s)]
*  Black bears will kill people. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4553.42s)]
*  And a kid got killed at Rutgers university. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4554.62s)]
*  And he was in the woods outside of Rutgers university a few years back in New Jersey. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4557.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4561.78s)]
*  New Jersey has the highest amount of black bears per capita in the United States. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4562.139999999999s)]
*  How crazy is that? [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4568.3s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4569.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4570.0199999999995s)]
*  And they banned hunting. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4570.3s)]
*  We have to stop the bear hunt. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4572.3s)]
*  The bears are your friends. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4573.94s)]
*  And then bear human encounters increased by over 200% over the term of this new [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4576.42s)]
*  governor. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4581.34s)]
*  And then he finally relinquished and now reopened the bear hunt. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4581.9800000000005s)]
*  Now they're going to extend the bear hunt. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4585.22s)]
*  They're going to have more of them because bears are not easy to hunt too. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4587.62s)]
*  And unless you're in open fields in the, in the spring where they're coming out [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4590.900000000001s)]
*  and they're eating grass, generally they hunt them in the thick shit with bait. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4595.14s)]
*  And people like, Oh, that's so wrong. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4599.9400000000005s)]
*  You're using bait, but it's literally the only way to control their populations. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4602.02s)]
*  You won't find them. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4606.9400000000005s)]
*  Like when, when we're up in Alberta and you go through the woods, you hardly ever [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4608.34s)]
*  see black bears. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4612.14s)]
*  You hardly, but they're everywhere. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4612.9800000000005s)]
*  They're all over the place. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4614.22s)]
*  They just smell you coming a million miles away and they steer clear. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4615.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they do. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4619.58s)]
*  So, so to wolves. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4620.42s)]
*  Yep. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4621.46s)]
*  We got a lot of coyotes out there at the boneyard. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4622.1s)]
*  I'll show you a picture that my friend, John Rivett sent me from Alberta. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4626.42s)]
*  He sent me this recently. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4629.700000000001s)]
*  A couple of weeks ago, there was wolves up there in front of one of his trail [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4631.3s)]
*  camps and it's a pretty fucking cool pictures. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4635.98s)]
*  Let me find this. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4642.339999999999s)]
*  I know he sent it to me recently. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4643.259999999999s)]
*  Oh, he might've sent it with Jen too. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4645.58s)]
*  Uh, but they live in a very remote part of Alberta where it's, you know, it's [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4649.58s)]
*  all what they call crown land up there, you know, so it's just, well, you know [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4659.0199999999995s)]
*  when it might be on Instagram, I'm not going to find it. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4665.42s)]
*  I know he sent it to me recently, but it's pretty fucking cool. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4668.46s)]
*  These bears that are up there or these wolves rather that are up there. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4671.3s)]
*  Uh, they killed something and they're all surrounding it, tearing it apart. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4674.38s)]
*  And it just happened to be in front of one of his trail cameras. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4678.7s)]
*  They caught it because they have, they have trail cameras set up on all these [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4680.9800000000005s)]
*  various roads to see what's walking in and walking out and they killed something [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4684.38s)]
*  right, you know, a few hundred yards or a few yards rather. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4687.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4692.22s)]
*  I let guys trap beaver on my ground and beavers can fuck up a water system [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4693.18s)]
*  pretty quick, especially if you have flowing water, you need to keep flowing [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4700.34s)]
*  and they'll dam it up and then you got problems. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4705.34s)]
*  So we have guys that go out and trap beavers in the winter. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4707.9s)]
*  I ate beaver. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4711.06s)]
*  I've never had beaver. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4712.38s)]
*  I had beaver with Steve Rinelli. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4713.62s)]
*  He cooked it. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4714.94s)]
*  He made like a beaver pot roast. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4715.42s)]
*  It was delicious. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4716.82s)]
*  It tasted almost like beef. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4717.86s)]
*  It was very good. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4719.54s)]
*  Oh, that kind of beaver. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4720.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4722.219999999999s)]
*  Oh, you're talking about the other guy. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4722.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4724.7s)]
*  The other, the other thing they used to eat, we, we tried, but it's [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4724.94s)]
*  disgusting is the tail. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4727.9s)]
*  They used to eat be like pioneers used to eat beaver tail. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4729.82s)]
*  The trappers used to eat it because it was a very good source of fat. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4732.74s)]
*  Cause the tail is basically all fat, but it's pretty nasty. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4736.5s)]
*  Did you try that? [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4740.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I ate it. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4741.139999999999s)]
*  I've never had that. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4742.5s)]
*  It's kind of weird. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4745.38s)]
*  It's not something you're interested in, but if you're starving, you know, it'd [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4746.54s)]
*  be a source of fat. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4750.46s)]
*  And I think that's what they were doing it for. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4751.9s)]
*  But the meat itself, like I said, he, he braised it and then he slow cooked. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4754.02s)]
*  It was very good. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4758.86s)]
*  It was like surprising to me that people don't hunt beavers for food. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4761.7s)]
*  That's how good it was. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4765.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4766.7s)]
*  Because they hunt them primarily for their pelts. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4766.9400000000005s)]
*  Yep. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4769.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4770.58s)]
*  It's a warm pelt too. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4771.06s)]
*  You know, it's great for. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4772.66s)]
*  So when you're up there, you have, you got wolves in that area. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4774.7s)]
*  You have bears in that area. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4779.5s)]
*  You got moose. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4781.34s)]
*  You got all this wildlife. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4782.74s)]
*  And then you have this piece of ground where all these animals from [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4785.02s)]

*  That is a special place you have. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4792.74s)]
*  It is. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4794.66s)]
*  It really is. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4795.42s)]
*  And it's been fairly unknown about. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4796.9s)]
*  Till now. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4800.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4801.06s)]
*  Have you had a problem with people going up there and looking around? [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4801.26s)]
*  Well, one of the things that we do. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4805.3s)]
*  My company has a, we're in a solid waste business. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4808.54s)]
*  We have a construction debris landfill close by. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4812.339999999999s)]
*  So we have really good access control. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4816.099999999999s)]
*  At one point in my life, when I had all this land, I was going, okay, I got to [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4819.099999999999s)]
*  somehow make a living with all this property if I'm not going to mine it. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4824.299999999999s)]
*  And I had a piece that was all mined out. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4829.179999999999s)]
*  We got it permitted to be a construction debris landfill. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4831.0599999999995s)]
*  I had looking around and go, how does, who owns it? [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4834.3s)]
*  Who owns a solid waste business in this country? [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4837.38s)]
*  Well, the mafia. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4841.26s)]
*  Okay. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4844.7s)]
*  I want to get in on what they're doing. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4845.86s)]
*  Cause that's where the money's at. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4848.38s)]
*  Solid waste. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4849.74s)]
*  Solid waste. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4850.9s)]
*  Landfills. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4852.54s)]
*  Yep. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4853.54s)]
*  Wouldn't that be dirty? [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4854.3s)]
*  Isn't that like, if you're dumping waste on your land, doesn't that leak into the [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4855.94s)]
*  ground and get into the water supply? [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4859.66s)]
*  Not if it would, but we only take construction debris. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4861.14s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4864.900000000001s)]
*  We have the airport sitting in our landfill. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4865.660000000001s)]
*  The Fairbanks old international airport, 700 houses from Isles and Air Force base. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4868.22s)]
*  You just chop them up, throw them in there? [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4873.780000000001s)]
*  No, we don't. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4875.34s)]
*  We just smash them. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4876.22s)]
*  We don't do the demolition. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4877.9400000000005s)]
*  We just have the place where the guys that do the demolition can take them. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4879.06s)]
*  So that's kind of how our company, even though we're a gold mining company, we're [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4882.860000000001s)]
*  actually land managers. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4888.42s)]
*  But when you're digging a hole like that, are you concerned that maybe they could dig [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4889.86s)]
*  a hole and there would be wooly mammoths in there too? [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4893.66s)]
*  Well, they're right next to where we're digging. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4896.5s)]
*  So, yeah. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4898.74s)]
*  I mean, wouldn't you think that unfortunately that they could smash and [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4899.58s)]
*  destroy valuable bones? [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4903.54s)]
*  No, no. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4905.26s)]
*  They're, they're just delivering the refuse. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4905.94s)]
*  Right. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4908.06s)]
*  But I mean, to dig that hole, right? [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4908.38s)]
*  No, the hole's already been dug. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4910.06s)]
*  Okay. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4912.02s)]
*  All that part has already been mined out. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4912.42s)]
*  And you're sure there's nothing in there? [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4915.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4917.34s)]
*  Okay. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4917.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4919.1s)]
*  There's stuff adjacent to it, but we don't impose on that. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4919.34s)]
*  So what is it about this one particular five acre area? [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4922.66s)]
*  Like, why are there so many animals in this one spot? [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4928.26s)]
*  And do you think there's multiple other spots? [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4931.22s)]
*  You said, you know, one, but you have 10,000 acres. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4933.34s)]
*  Yep. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4937.820000000001s)]
*  I mean, how many more of those are out there and how many more in the surrounding [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4938.1s)]
*  land that's not yours might also hold these similar piles of these dead ancient [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4942.58s)]
*  animals? [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4949.42s)]
*  We have no way of knowing. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4950.74s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4952.02s)]
*  We, we, listen, I've spent 15 years on this one piece. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4953.3s)]
*  15 years on five acres. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4958.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4959.5s)]
*  And my wife, by the way, my wife calls it my adorable little hobby. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4960.7s)]
*  So when she sees this, if she ever discovers how much money we spend on [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4965.5s)]
*  fuel and equipment, you know, I'm in trouble. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4969.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4974.34s)]
*  But historically, I mean, it's so significant. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4974.54s)]
*  I mean, it's, it's such an unusual place. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4978.7s)]
*  Like when I first found your page, I thought some, I'm, something's wrong here. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4980.42s)]
*  I'm reading something wrong. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4985.38s)]
*  I can't always come in from this one place. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4986.26s)]
*  Like this guy, maybe this guy collects it, brings it in from other places. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4987.82s)]
*  Maybe he's a paleontologist. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4991.099999999999s)]
*  And then I'm like, no, this guy's just fucking finding this shit on his land. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4993.22s)]
*  And the way you were going about it, it's like, I just put it over there. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=4997.299999999999s)]
*  I was like, this is bananas. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5001.339999999999s)]
*  Like these are huge scientific discoveries. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5002.94s)]
*  Yep. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5005.7s)]
*  I'm not a scientist. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5007.62s)]
*  Well, I guarantee you a lot of them. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5009.139999999999s)]
*  Well, many must already know about you, right? [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5011.379999999999s)]
*  No. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5014.179999999999s)]
*  No. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5014.94s)]
*  No. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5015.58s)]
*  They might after this. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5016.0599999999995s)]
*  How do they not know if you're a paleontologist and you're studying short [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5017.54s)]
*  face bears or if you're studying, you know, these ancient deceased mammoths and all [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5021.5s)]
*  these, wouldn't you be, wouldn't you be drawn to your place? [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5027.42s)]
*  You would think now the fellow that made that documentary film, he's really, he [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5031.94s)]
*  did a beautiful job on that documentary. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5039.34s)]
*  He's won several film contests. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5041.3s)]
*  Most recent was the Denali film contest last summer. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5044.9800000000005s)]
*  It's no, this hasn't gotten really seen by anybody, but we went up to the [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5049.3s)]
*  explorers club in New York city for a screening of it several years ago when [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5054.3s)]
*  it was done and those people were really interested in it and I'm in the explorers [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5058.9800000000005s)]
*  club, Drew's in the explorers club. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5066.02s)]
*  We do some pretty neat shit, but I don't know any, we don't, we're not looking [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5067.54s)]
*  for anybody to come out there. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5074.58s)]
*  We're kind of like, I'll only tell Joe Rogan about this. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5076.78s)]
*  You've lasted three fucking years and now look what happened. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5081.62s)]
*  But you're, I mean, I don't want to say you're obligated, but it's like, I think [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5084.74s)]
*  what you're sitting on is of immense historical significance. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5090.219999999999s)]
*  Not only that, but it's going to be very expensive for those guys, whoever does [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5095.94s)]
*  this kind of work to do the proper research because it's a moving body of [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5099.179999999999s)]
*  frozen ice and muck with trees that can topple down the size of your chunks of [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5105.34s)]

*  So that's why we don't want a bunch of people out there wandering around. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5115.26s)]
*  Right. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5119.02s)]
*  And you've developed a method to do it. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5119.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah, we have. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5122.06s)]
*  And you're just kind of doing it for yourself. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5123.34s)]
*  We're just doing it. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5125.46s)]
*  It's like going Easter egg hunting every day. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5126.9400000000005s)]

*  The whole story is crazy, but it's just crazy that you've got this five acre [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5141.26s)]
*  patch of land that's yielded dire wolves, short-faced bears. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5145.3s)]

*  So he just goes in this washout and pulls out these tusks. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5162.620000000001s)]
*  How many more do you think are in there? [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5167.14s)]
*  We have no clue. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5169.780000000001s)]
*  That is so insane. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5172.780000000001s)]
*  This was the day after the day. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5174.54s)]
*  You know, the day before we had pulled out a mammoth and a half. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5176.900000000001s)]
*  And that's another tusk over there he's grabbing? [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5181.42s)]

*  So they're just everywhere in there. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5185.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5187.18s)]
*  There had to be just thousands of animals that died and died in a way where they [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5188.1s)]
*  froze and sunk into the muck. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5194.54s)]
*  I think they were transported there by water. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5197.5s)]
*  I don't, I don't think they died right there. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5201.94s)]
*  We, we found some mummies. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5204.02s)]
*  Oh, like they died in a flood. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5205.26s)]
*  They could have wherever they died and that just happened to end up there. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5207.74s)]
*  But so many of them? [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5211.86s)]
*  Just guessing, right? [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5215.62s)]

*  Cause so you found physical tissue like muscle and tissue and you cooked it. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5253.1s)]
*  I have a friend up there that found a bison blue babe is what it's called. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5259.82s)]

*  Yep. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5293.1s)]
*  And, uh, you guys cut a chunk off that and threw it in the Traeger? [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5294.9s)]
*  Not off that one. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5299.42s)]
*  But when he found it, he got ahold of the museum. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5300.62s)]
*  He says, Hey, I have, I have something coming out of the muck here. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5303.06s)]
*  You guys might want to come look at it. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5305.5s)]
*  But before I tell you about it, what's the process? [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5306.780000000001s)]
*  Well, what do you think it is? [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5310.9800000000005s)]
*  Well, I think it's a, I think it's an ice age animal. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5312.3s)]
*  Well, and it's right where I'm mining. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5315.58s)]
*  And they said, well, we can do an emergency excavation. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5317.740000000001s)]
*  We can come in and have it out of there in a day. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5321.820000000001s)]

*  And he said, well, I'm gonna go get it. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5327.34s)]
*  He said, okay, come get it. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5328.66s)]
*  And he told him where it was. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5329.78s)]
*  They went in there and this is significant. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5331.86s)]
*  Uh, you're done mining here. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5337.74s)]

*  It's going to take us a while. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5348.42s)]
*  So he's a friend of mine. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5350.26s)]

*  And he goes, I had to go mine another Creek the rest of that summer. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5353.22s)]
*  You want to know the name of that Creek? [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5357.74s)]

*  No. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5522.42s)]
*  Property. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5522.98s)]
*  Nobody likes those guys. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5525.14s)]
*  Stealing shit. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5528.46s)]
*  And the guy didn't file charges for being wounded. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5531.18s)]
*  He just kind of went someplace. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5534.94s)]
*  Jesus Christ. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5539.34s)]
*  But, but my buddy, his mom came up to visit and go to the museum up there to see, he [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5541.62s)]
*  says, come on, mom, I want to show you Blue Babe. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5548.58s)]
*  So they went up there and it was a $3 admission per person. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5551.58s)]
*  He gets to the front and he says, yeah, this is my mom. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5556.06s)]
*  And there'll be two of us, but I'm the guy that discovered Blue Babe and [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5560.34s)]
*  the girl there taking the money. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5565.9s)]
*  She didn't know any better. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5567.18s)]
*  She goes, Oh, that's nice. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5568.02s)]
*  Let me, he says, yeah, he says, let me make a call. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5570.86s)]
*  So she calls somebody. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5575.22s)]
*  She comes back and says, I'll tell you what, we're going to let you in for free, [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5576.9s)]
*  but it's going to be three bucks for your mom. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5580.86s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5582.98s)]
*  Oh my God is right. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5584.06s)]
*  They made a big mistake because the same guy found a full wooly mammoth. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5585.339999999999s)]
*  You asked if I ate wooly mammoth before he didn't make no fucking phone call. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5592.259999999999s)]
*  Had a little bit of a barbecue. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5600.62s)]
*  Jesus. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5602.299999999999s)]
*  A lot of Jack Daniels and shit like that went down. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5603.98s)]
*  Now explain what the, what condition the meat was in. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5607.339999999999s)]
*  Was it frozen solid? [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5609.98s)]
*  No, not by the time we ate it. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5611.54s)]
*  Right. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5613.46s)]
*  When he found it. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5614.46s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5615.299999999999s)]
*  It was frozen solid. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5615.86s)]
*  Yes sir. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5616.74s)]
*  And so he just thaws it out. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5618.0199999999995s)]
*  And once, once it's out of the permafrost, it starts melting. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5622.34s)]
*  And then what was it like? [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5626.299999999999s)]
*  Like, like a steak? [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5628.219999999999s)]
*  Oh fuck no. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5630.58s)]
*  Like a shoe leather. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5631.9s)]
*  Well, of course they're very thick. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5633.78s)]
*  You got a saute. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5635.62s)]
*  You got to, you got to put them in some kind of, you know, you got to let them [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5636.54s)]
*  soak into it, some kind of marinated. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5640.219999999999s)]
*  Did you have any apprehension about eating a 20,000 year old mammoth? [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5642.14s)]
*  Not after the first few drinks. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5647.54s)]
*  How much of it did you guys cook? [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5652.02s)]
*  Wasn't very much. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5654.38s)]
*  He sold the whole animal to a collector. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5656.46s)]
*  Got close to half a million bucks for it. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5660.5s)]
*  Wow. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5662.22s)]
*  And so how does, how does one even transport? [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5663.5s)]
*  Do you have to refreeze it? [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5666.740000000001s)]
*  Like, what do you do? [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5668.58s)]
*  I think the buyer just wanted the bones. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5669.82s)]
*  He wanted the skeleton. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5671.74s)]
*  Oh, because the skeleton of a wooly mammoth is very expensive. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5672.98s)]
*  You know, you talk about tusks. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5677.26s)]
*  It wouldn't that tissue be very valuable? [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5678.58s)]
*  I'm not the only guy around. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5683.54s)]
*  It's eating mammoth up there. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5684.58s)]
*  What? [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5686.7s)]
*  No, it's sort of small club of you guys. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5688.54s)]
*  I don't know what, I don't know if it's a small club. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5691.18s)]
*  We don't recognize it in each other, but it's a, you got no choice. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5693.54s)]
*  You find a wooly mammoth with meat on it. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5698.14s)]
*  You're going to have to eat some of it. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5700.54s)]
*  You just have to. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5702.58s)]
*  Why? [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5703.700000000001s)]
*  What's the point if you don't? [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5705.660000000001s)]
*  Well, you didn't even eat that bear. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5707.26s)]
*  What's that? [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5710.34s)]
*  The bear you shot. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5711.42s)]
*  You didn't eat him. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5712.34s)]
*  No, he was too fresh. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5713.22s)]
*  That's so ridiculous. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5715.54s)]
*  Too fresh. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5717.58s)]
*  So how did they cook it? [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5718.3s)]
*  They sauteed it and slow cooked it. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5719.860000000001s)]
*  Like what'd they do? [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5721.9800000000005s)]
*  No, just carved it. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5722.780000000001s)]
*  Carved meat off, threw it on a stick and over a campfire. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5723.820000000001s)]
*  Really? [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5727.5s)]
*  Caveman style. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5728.42s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5729.38s)]
*  Until you go caveman, you know, you're the kind of guy to go caveman in an instant. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5731.900000000001s)]
*  You'd be up there fucking running around a campfire, chewing on a wooly mammoth, [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5737.3s)]
*  prime rib, you'd be... [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5742.02s)]
*  So you put a little salt on it? [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5745.38s)]
*  How are you eating it? [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5746.78s)]
*  It's just whiskey. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5747.5s)]
*  No, I've changed my, I've changed my drink to tequila because I know it's healthy for me. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5750.34s)]
*  Healthy. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5754.74s)]
*  Air quotes healthy. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5755.78s)]
*  So how many of you ate this mammoth? [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5757.58s)]
*  Yeah, about 10 of us. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5761.66s)]
*  10 of you. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5763.06s)]
*  Just everybody has a couple of bites or do you like have a full meal? [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5764.14s)]
*  Oh fuck no. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5767.18s)]
*  Just a few bites. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5768.18s)]
*  That's all you want. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5769.02s)]
*  Does it taste good? [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5770.54s)]
*  You know, it's like when you jump into your ice water, it's different. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5772.900000000001s)]
*  How many people do that? [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5780.5s)]
*  I think a lot now. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5782.78s)]
*  Probably a few people. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5784.9400000000005s)]
*  It's pretty common amongst the kind of people that I associate with. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5786.98s)]
*  I was down in Juneau for a tourism deal when I sold my business to Carnival the night before [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5793.9s)]
*  we all got a little bit liquored up. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5800.099999999999s)]
*  And the next morning I had to put the final negotiations together with these guys. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5802.9s)]
*  So I went out to the glacier that's just outside of Juneau, I think it's called Mendenhall. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5808.179999999999s)]
*  And got out there, walked out there, never seen it. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5813.259999999999s)]
*  And there's nobody around late in the fall. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5816.139999999999s)]
*  And I'm a swimmer. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5818.98s)]
*  I go, fuck, you ain't got a ball if you don't go hop in that water. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5819.86s)]
*  So I know what it's like to get nice cold water. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5824.5s)]
*  So I stripped down, went in. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5826.94s)]
*  God damn, this is cold. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5831.98s)]
*  And I got the hell out. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5833.219999999999s)]
*  But my hair was still dry. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5834.78s)]
*  I said, what kind of pussy are you? [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5837.46s)]
*  You got to go in there and think, oh, I'm going to die. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5840.58s)]
*  Swim a little bit. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5842.86s)]
*  So I went back in, took a few strokes, hit a piece of ice with my hand like it was the end of the pool deck. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5844.7s)]
*  Swam back out, got out, put my pants on, put my shoes on, walked back to my rental car, got up to my rental car, [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5852.94s)]
*  going back into Juneau, going too fast through residential area, get pulled over by a cop. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5861.339999999999s)]
*  License registration. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5868.42s)]
*  I said, it's a rental car. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5869.54s)]
*  Here's my license. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5870.38s)]
*  He goes, how come you ain't got a shirt on? [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5871.9400000000005s)]
*  Why is your hair wet? [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5874.3s)]
*  I said, I have a meeting. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5876.26s)]
*  I was trying to get my cobwebs out of my head. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5877.54s)]
*  I went swimming with that glacier down there. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5879.58s)]
*  He goes, you went in there and swimming? [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5882.700000000001s)]
*  I said, yeah. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5884.18s)]
*  He goes, get the fuck out of here. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=5885.780000000001s)]

*  Now. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6157.18s)]
*  This will piss off some of your Texas folks. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6158.78s)]

*  Let's say we did that to Alaska. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6166.46s)]
*  North Alaska, South Alaska. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6168.82s)]
*  All right. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6170.5s)]
*  Makes Texas the third largest state. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6171.26s)]
*  Right now they can say they're the second largest state. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6174.78s)]
*  Until 1959, they were the biggest state. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6177.14s)]
*  So it's bigger than two Texas's. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6181.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6183.82s)]

*  Yeah. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6215.18s)]

*  Up a little farther, right in there. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6222.0199999999995s)]
*  Dude, that's Alaska. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6223.62s)]
*  That's still Alaska. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6225.82s)]
*  That's so funny that the hardiest of hardy people. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6228.74s)]
*  I had that woman, what is her name? [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6231.82s)]
*  Sue, what's her name from Sue Aikens from Life Below Zero? [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6233.14s)]
*  What a wild lady that is. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6239.26s)]
*  I'll tell you what. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6240.74s)]
*  That lady got attacked by a bear. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6241.74s)]
*  Mangled. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6243.62s)]
*  Broke her hip. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6244.26s)]
*  Fucking tore her apart. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6246.26s)]
*  She crawls back to her place. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6247.82s)]
*  There's no one around. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6250.22s)]
*  Right? [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6251.34s)]
*  Everyone is a plane flight of like seven hours to get to her. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6251.7s)]
*  Right? [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6255.7s)]
*  She heals up, goes back out, kills that bear and eats it. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6256.74s)]
*  I believe every word of that too. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6266.5s)]
*  A hundred percent. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6267.94s)]
*  She is a hard lady. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6270.0199999999995s)]
*  That is a hard. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6271.98s)]
*  She was a wonderful person to talk to. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6272.66s)]
*  I really enjoyed her company. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6274.42s)]
*  She's a fascinating person. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6276.18s)]
*  I mean, again, as hardy as it gets. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6277.82s)]
*  She is. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6281.38s)]
*  And she lives in that area where you're not allowed to have permanent structures. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6281.78s)]
*  So the structures that she lives in all have like cloth outside. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6286.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, that's her. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6292.22s)]
*  Yep. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6292.98s)]
*  So they live in these houses that the bears can rip into and get into them. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6293.5s)]
*  So like she has to be locked and loaded everywhere she goes. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6300.46s)]
*  They got polar bears where she's at too, I think. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6303.82s)]
*  Those are nasty critters. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6307.98s)]
*  They're the nastiest. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6309.259999999999s)]
*  They're the only ones that don't eat anything but meat. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6310.78s)]
*  And they're nothing compared to those short-faced bears. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6315.339999999999s)]
*  Oh fuck. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6317.42s)]
*  Sure. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6317.82s)]
*  We're lucky those aren't around. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6318.099999999999s)]
*  What's the biggest, how many short-faced bear skulls have you found out there? [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6320.099999999999s)]
*  Two. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6323.74s)]
*  Two. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6324.46s)]
*  And not only that, but I found years ago when I was mining as a worker at another [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6325.34s)]
*  camp, I was a hydraulica, I was a guy on a giant, I found a saber tooth skull. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6331.299999999999s)]
*  And the university of Alaska, head of geology had brought up visiting [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6336.74s)]
*  dignitary from somewhere in England, some museum in England, and they were [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6341.54s)]
*  going around meeting people. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6345.98s)]
*  And I showed this guy from England my saber tooth tiger skull. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6348.54s)]
*  At the time I was 20, probably 26, 27. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6353.34s)]
*  And he says, Hey, that's, that's a unique specimen. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6361.7s)]
*  How about I take it back to England with me and I'll clean it and I'll restore [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6365.06s)]
*  it and send it back to you. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6368.22s)]
*  I said, okay. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6370.9400000000005s)]
*  Off it went. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6372.78s)]
*  Guess what? [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6374.06s)]
*  Never saw it again. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6374.78s)]
*  Never saw it again. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6375.46s)]
*  Of course. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6376.26s)]
*  So that's worth a lot of money too. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6377.62s)]
*  Oh fuck. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6380.18s)]
*  I found another one in the archives of the bones that were sent to AMNH and it [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6381.42s)]
*  was on a shipping manifest, saber tooth tiger skull. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6390.0599999999995s)]
*  But somehow when I went to visit AMNH, they didn't show it to me. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6395.0599999999995s)]
*  And then if you watch that, what you did, you watched the documentary today. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6399.58s)]
*  They said, oh, well, Pat Druckenmiller said it's to his knowledge, there's [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6404.099999999999s)]
*  never been a saber tooth tiger skull found in Alaska. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6407.82s)]
*  So the one I sent to England has never come back. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6412.42s)]
*  And the one that AMNH apparently got, but never wrote up a report on, [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6415.82s)]
*  never made it any place. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6421.58s)]
*  Could it be in those crates? [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6423.7s)]
*  It could be, it could be in some benefactor's house. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6425.0199999999995s)]
*  Probably. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6429.0599999999995s)]
*  And let's, let's explore that a little bit in terms of the bones that were [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6430.34s)]
*  dumped in the river. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6435.099999999999s)]
*  What if they're not there? [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6435.9s)]
*  Right. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6439.219999999999s)]
*  What if they distributed amongst their wealthy friends? [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6439.74s)]
*  That's how you get rid of stuff like that. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6442.379999999999s)]
*  You get your benefactors, Hey, would you like a mammoth tusk? [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6444.66s)]
*  Sure. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6447.179999999999s)]
*  I wouldn't imagine anybody would throw a mammoth tusk away. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6447.46s)]
*  I would think even back then they would really, God, that's so crazy. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6450.58s)]
*  They had hundreds of thousands of bones. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6457.0199999999995s)]
*  We have a couple hundred, few thousand. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6460.82s)]
*  They could take up a lot of space. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6463.02s)]
*  I get it, but throwing them away seems to insane waste of something that's very [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6465.620000000001s)]
*  valuable. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6470.820000000001s)]
*  Even back then, I think they would understand that it's valuable. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6472.02s)]
*  You know what? [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6478.620000000001s)]
*  By the way, I brought you a hat. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6480.42s)]
*  Oh, thank you. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6481.700000000001s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6482.5s)]

*  Oh man. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6649.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6650.0599999999995s)]
*  A hundred percent. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6650.46s)]
*  I sent Kelly Slater, was doing a fundraiser for a homeless surfer. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6651.58s)]
*  So I sent him a care package of things to sell at the auction that they were going [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6657.86s)]
*  to give the money to this guy and I included some picks and some pipes and some stuff. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6662.0599999999995s)]
*  Wow. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6668.58s)]
*  And he, I said, Hey, if you know any guitar guys that might appreciate it, make sure you [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6669.42s)]
*  give them one of these picks. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6677.219999999999s)]
*  So he sends me this video year and a half later. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6679.5s)]
*  So it's been a while tracking this guy down. [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6682.42s)]
*  He's given a pick to Eddie Vedder. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6685.9s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6688.34s)]
*  He sent me the video. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6689.0599999999995s)]
*  I think I have it posted on my, on my site. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6689.94s)]
*  And he's playing with it. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6692.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6693.5s)]
*  Eddie Vedder is going, well, Kelly given it to him. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6694.7s)]
*  He goes, Oh, this is cool. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6699.139999999999s)]
*  Cause he likes to collect fossils too. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6700.3s)]
*  Apparently. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6702.7s)]
*  So that's pretty cool. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6704.5s)]
*  We make Drew and I make stuff. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6706.3s)]
*  We make earrings. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6708.62s)]
*  We make pipes. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6709.58s)]
*  We make, I'm a little torn on that. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6711.099999999999s)]
*  It's extinct. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6713.58s)]
*  I know. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6715.259999999999s)]
*  You know how many elephants we've saved? [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6715.94s)]
*  How many elephants have you saved? [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6719.139999999999s)]
*  What do you mean? [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6720.7s)]
*  It's illegal to carve elephant ivory anymore. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6721.179999999999s)]
*  You're not allowed to even kill. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6723.259999999999s)]
*  You're not allowed to deal in elephant ivory anymore. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6724.46s)]
*  They used to be able to use pre-ban ivory for like pool cues and things like that. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6727.0599999999995s)]
*  It was all elephants that were shot decades and decades ago. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6733.0199999999995s)]
*  And the logic behind it was they've already been killed. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6737.0599999999995s)]
*  It would be a horrible waste to just leave this stuff or in some places they burned it. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6740.98s)]
*  Have you ever seen those where they have piles of tusks and they just burn them? [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6746.82s)]
*  Which seems, that seems even worse to me. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6751.5s)]
*  Well, the mammoth ivory, we have thousands of pounds of broken tusks. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6754.78s)]
*  They come out broken, just like the bones. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6760.86s)]
*  So we make stuff out of it. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6763.62s)]
*  Wow. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6766.66s)]
*  You know, it's in the pics, apparently make the guitar sound better. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6767.46s)]
*  Drew's dad plays and he loves his. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6771.700000000001s)]
*  It's got to be better than plastic. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6773.46s)]
*  Well, just the thought behind it would almost kind of make it better. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6775.1s)]
*  Like a knowing that you're playing with something that died 20,000 years ago. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6778.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6782.700000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6784.62s)]
*  No, it's a mind blower. [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6785.14s)]
*  But it's, I'm torn, Jamie. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6786.18s)]
*  Are you a little torn on this too? [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6788.22s)]
*  Does it seem kind of fucked up that you're making stuff out of a limited resource of [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6789.58s)]
*  things that died tens of thousands of years ago? [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6796.06s)]
*  You see what I'm saying? [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6801.620000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but you're just talking about those elephants. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6802.5s)]
*  We're talking about something that died 20,000. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6806.900000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6808.860000000001s)]
*  But they're still making elephants. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6809.1s)]
*  You know, I don't think you should kill elephants for their ivory for sure. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6811.9400000000005s)]
*  But the pre-ban ivory, that's an animal that exists. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6815.02s)]
*  They're still around. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6819.820000000001s)]
*  Let me call my wife, moaning, hide that ivory and shit. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6821.54s)]
*  Gigs up. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6824.700000000001s)]
*  Well, it just, it seems to me that it could very easily go down. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6825.58s)]
*  You can have that. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6830.22s)]
*  Oh, thank you very much. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6830.780000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6832.06s)]
*  It just seems to me that it could very easily go down that they would make that illegal. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6833.5s)]
*  It's possible. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6838.02s)]
*  I know they made walrus ivory illegal. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6838.900000000001s)]
*  You can still use prehistoric walrus ivory for the things that the carvers use. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6841.26s)]
*  That's even more fucked up. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6847.860000000001s)]
*  You know, so you could use the stuff from the animals that are long extinct. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6849.42s)]
*  Again, a very finite resource. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6852.7s)]
*  But you can't use the ones from the ones that are alive. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6855.02s)]
*  I prefer to think that the less of that resource that's available, the more valuable it becomes. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6857.66s)]
*  That is true. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6862.9400000000005s)]
*  But if everybody turns them into pot pipes, it's going to be a real fucking problem. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6864.06s)]
*  Not everybody will. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6867.1s)]
*  My daughter makes beautiful jewelry out of her little pieces of ivory that she has. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6867.86s)]
*  She's the Saks Fifth Avenue of mammoth ivory jewelry. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6873.26s)]
*  Jew and I are the dollar general. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6877.5s)]
*  Does your daughter have a website where she sells her stuff? [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6879.74s)]
*  Laura Longley does, you know, that's her Instagram. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6881.98s)]
*  Go to her Instagram, see if you can find her. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6885.62s)]
*  Yeah, it's awesome. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6888.66s)]
*  She's, she's really good at it. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6889.62s)]
*  And so she just sells it? [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6892.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6894.139999999999s)]
*  She just had a Christmas thing that she unloaded or unloaded. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6894.58s)]
*  She sold eight nice pieces. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6898.9s)]
*  They call it when you drop, I guess, when you drop. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6902.099999999999s)]
*  So here it is. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6904.42s)]
*  So this stuff that she has all that, this is all mammoth ivory. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6906.5s)]
*  Mammoth ivory. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6910.82s)]
*  And then you see some with gold nuggets on it. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6912.22s)]
*  That also, um, that's pretty fucking cool. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6915.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6917.94s)]
*  Also comes off our ground. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6918.3s)]

*  Oh yeah. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6921.3s)]
*  She's, she's Tony. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6921.62s)]
*  She's Saks Fifth Avenue. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6923.38s)]
*  That's cool looking stuff. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6925.26s)]
*  I'll tell you that that ring right there with a piece of walrus, ivory, ivory in it [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6926.58s)]
*  or mammoth, ivory, whatever that is. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6929.86s)]
*  Yep. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6931.34s)]
*  That's mammoth ivory. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6932.1s)]
*  Yep. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6933.02s)]
*  And she turns that into a ring. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6933.62s)]
*  You got to remember that what we start with is a nasty looking, just shard. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6935.82s)]
*  And she spends a lot of time on those. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6942.339999999999s)]
*  She's making cabs now and she's, she's learning the business from a guy up in, [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6944.46s)]

*  We have a set of tusks in there for sale that we found on another creek. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6954.259999999999s)]
*  It's a match set. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6957.82s)]
*  So you sell the tusks? [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6959.259999999999s)]
*  Off another creek. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6960.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6961.5s)]
*  Not, not from the boneyard. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6961.74s)]
*  Oh. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6963.58s)]
*  We keep everything from the boneyard in one collection, but we have a bunch of [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6963.9400000000005s)]
*  different, uh, mining operations going. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6968.58s)]
*  And when you do have them, what do you do? [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6971.02s)]
*  You put it up for auction or something? [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6972.74s)]
*  You put it at Christie's or what do you do? [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6974.26s)]
*  No, we sell them. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6975.900000000001s)]
*  Told this guy, go ahead and sell them if you want. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6976.900000000001s)]
*  Wow. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6979.66s)]
*  He's got a real upscale jewelry store in Jacksonville. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6980.62s)]
*  So someone wants to buy a mammoth tusk. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6983.5s)]
*  How much does one of those cost? [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6986.14s)]
*  Um, that pair he's selling right there is like 250, 225,000. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6988.14s)]
*  So I know. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6993.78s)]
*  Wow. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6995.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6996.62s)]
*  I know a rich guy bought a saber tooth tiger head, but a real saber tooth [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=6997.38s)]
*  tiger skull probably bought it from your guy stole it from you. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7002.26s)]
*  You know, they have a, they have a lot of, uh, saber tooth tigers, I think in [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7011.14s)]
*  Eastern Europe, Western Europe, that area. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7016.42s)]
*  But Alaska, they find them in Los Angeles. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7019.900000000001s)]
*  It's the La Brea tar pits. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7024.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7025.9800000000005s)]
*  Which is bizarre. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7026.42s)]
*  If you're around La Brea, you're like, surely I'm in the wrong place. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7028.66s)]
*  Yep. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7032.7s)]
*  And then you go to the La Brea tar pit museum and you're like, what the fuck? [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7033.22s)]
*  It's right here. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7036.58s)]
*  We found, we found more bones in 15 years and they found in a hundred. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7037.9400000000005s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7042.860000000001s)]
*  And I've been there. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7043.820000000001s)]
*  And they have a lot of dire wolves in that display. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7044.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7048.0199999999995s)]
*  But, you know, dire wolves never lived up in Alaska. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7050.099999999999s)]
*  That's what's crazy is that your one five acre plot has changed where they [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7052.86s)]
*  thought dire wolves lived. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7058.26s)]
*  Not, not just them, but I mean, the fact that they're finding badgers, [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7059.7s)]
*  we find badger skulls. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7064.099999999999s)]
*  Some of the experts say, well, badgers didn't live here back in the ice age. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7066.9s)]
*  But my, one of my most significant finds ever is a blue feather, a blue feather. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7071.42s)]
*  I have it on my site someplace. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7078.0199999999995s)]
*  It was buried deep inside the hollow end of a 10 foot mammoth tusk that was under [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7080.38s)]
*  65 feet overburden in the gravels. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7086.42s)]
*  And you know, when you're cleaning out a tusk, when you get it out of the ground [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7090.219999999999s)]
*  and the material starts to dry, we put clamps on those tusks so as they dry, [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7093.3s)]
*  they don't split. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7098.7s)]
*  And out of the end comes this blue feather. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7100.3s)]
*  That's it. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7106.139999999999s)]
*  People go, what's your most significant find ever? [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7108.099999999999s)]
*  I go that blue feather. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7111.66s)]
*  Is that a peacock? [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7112.82s)]
*  I don't know what the fuck that is. [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7114.0599999999995s)]
*  People go, why don't you carbon date it? [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7116.3s)]
*  Okay. [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7118.139999999999s)]
*  Well, there's not a whole lot left of it now, so let's burn it all the fuck up so [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7118.42s)]
*  we can know how old it was. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7122.58s)]
*  No idea what that is? [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7127.22s)]
*  Have no clue. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7128.54s)]
*  But I've heard from paleontologists, you're going to call this one. [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7130.02s)]
*  That's impossible. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7134.740000000001s)]
*  There were no birds up here with blue feathers during the ice age. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7135.62s)]
*  So I've always wondered that. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7142.860000000001s)]
*  I see yellow in there too though. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7145.1s)]
*  Yeah, there's yellow in there for sure. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7146.740000000001s)]
*  I've always wondered that in terms of like how they know, like the fossil record is [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7148.780000000001s)]
*  fascinating to me because it's not easy for things to become fossils. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7153.42s)]
*  It's very difficult. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7157.98s)]
*  It requires very specific circumstances and most things, the vast majority of [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7158.94s)]
*  things never become fossils. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7163.66s)]
*  You know, there's the forest Galante. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7166.62s)]
*  There's a, see if you can find this video. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7168.46s)]
*  He thinks that dragons might've been a real thing. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7170.58s)]
*  I think he could be onto something there. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7174.3s)]
*  He says, if you look at the same period of time throughout Europe and in Asia, [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7175.86s)]
*  they were all drawing the same thing. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7181.34s)]
*  And there's people battling the same thing. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7184.0599999999995s)]
*  And he said, if you had an animal that had very thin bones, because it could fly [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7187.9s)]
*  the same as a bird does, and they died and they weren't fossilized, there'd be [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7193.22s)]
*  no record of them. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7198.62s)]
*  There'd be nothing left. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7199.9s)]
*  And he thinks it's really possible that at one point in time, that was a real [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7201.98s)]
*  animal. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7205.86s)]
*  Here, play this. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7206.18s)]
*  A scaley animal that could fly. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7206.86s)]
*  So when you take, when you break that down, you think about the fact that large [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7210.78s)]
*  birds had a hard time being fossilized because their bones are so porous, right? [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7214.34s)]
*  So because bones, they have like hollowish bones, they break down very easily and [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7217.860000000001s)]
*  they don't fossilize. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7221.860000000001s)]
*  So the group that says this, basically they're saying the evidence is the reason [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7223.26s)]
*  there's no fossils of dragons is because they had bird bones and they were actually [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7228.34s)]
*  very delicate animals. [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7232.3s)]
*  But a handful of these small, a small population of these giant flying lizards [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7233.66s)]
*  existed and basically encompassed all these different countries where they all [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7239.86s)]
*  depicted fighting dragons in their own way and they were all killed off by, you [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7244.34s)]
*  know, knights or whatever it is and then didn't fossilize. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7248.34s)]
*  What? [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7252.82s)]
*  So it's like the science is saying that if there were lizards big enough to fly [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7253.42s)]
*  around and eat people, they didn't have bones that could fossilize. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7257.219999999999s)]
*  So it'd be like an eagle. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7260.219999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7261.42s)]
*  And so, and that's why, you know, that's why all these human populations around the [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7262.0599999999995s)]
*  world have depictions of them, because they did actually exist. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7267.0199999999995s)]
*  Now, are there any? [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7270.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7272.46s)]
*  Wow. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7273.219999999999s)]
*  Well, makes you think the fossil record is a really fascinating thing because [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7274.0599999999995s)]
*  we're there, they're getting their understanding of what existed and didn't [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7279.219999999999s)]
*  exist based on what was fossilized. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7283.74s)]
*  And it's so, especially when you come to the dinosaurs, they're always [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7286.74s)]
*  finding a new dinosaur. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7289.54s)]
*  I mean, it's a regular thing that they find a new species of dinosaur. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7291.42s)]
*  You know, every few years they find something. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7296.219999999999s)]
*  The university curator, Pat Druckenmiller, that was on the video you watched, he's [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7298.299999999999s)]
*  got six or seven dinosaurs that he's discovered himself. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7304.78s)]
*  And when you discover it, you get to name it. [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7309.0599999999995s)]
*  So he's, he's that kind of, he's, he's really legit. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7311.62s)]
*  And we've run into a problem with people that say they're paleontologists, but [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7316.259999999999s)]
*  they're really just looking to get a collection going. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7323.82s)]
*  And we're not interested in assisting. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7326.94s)]
*  I would imagine that's a big thing with people. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7330.62s)]
*  And the other thing is the AMNH has poisoned the well for me when it comes to [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7332.78s)]
*  sending anything outside, outside the state of Alaska. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7338.22s)]
*  And the way it works in America, you talked about in this documentary that in [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7341.98s)]
*  some countries, like in Canada, if someone finds something, it becomes property of [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7346.3s)]
*  the country, but in America, it's yours. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7351.26s)]
*  If you own the land, it's yours. [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7356.22s)]
*  But if you find that what I'm finding on the state mine or state landing claim or [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7358.54s)]
*  mining claims or federal claims, they own it. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7363.1s)]
*  They're the landowner. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7366.62s)]
*  They don't always take possession of it, but if they want to, they'll come in and [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7368.3s)]
*  stop you from mining. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7371.58s)]
*  I can't imagine why someone hasn't reached out to you. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7373.34s)]
*  Why there isn't like, Oh, they have. [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7377.34s)]
*  You know, I told them I'll only tell this story to Joe Rogan. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7381.34s)]
*  I've been leaning on this crutch now for three years. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7385.98s)]
*  You fucked it all up a little bit when you invited me on your show. [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7388.46s)]
*  I had to have you on. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7391.58s)]
*  I'm so fascinated by your page. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7392.86s)]
*  And it's the story itself is even more crazy than I thought it was. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7395.18s)]
*  I just thought I didn't realize the scope of the collection. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7398.86s)]
*  Oh, it's huge. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7402.78s)]
*  Well, it's going to get a lot bigger, but we will not allow any of our fossils [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7403.98s)]
*  outside the state of Alaska. [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7409.66s)]
*  That's why we built that five thousand square foot facility this fall. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7411.0199999999995s)]
*  And might have to build another one. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7415.02s)]
*  Yeah, it's already in the works. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7417.820000000001s)]
*  So as you dig into these, what do you call them? [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7420.3s)]
*  Muck Hills. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7423.02s)]
*  As you dig into these, there's a potential. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7425.26s)]
*  I mean, how much of the land have you excavated? [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7427.580000000001s)]
*  Have you extracted these things from myself personally? [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7431.42s)]
*  Well, just like the whole company. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7436.9400000000005s)]
*  The company is probably mined out of the 10,000 acres that I currently [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7438.9400000000005s)]
*  own, have probably mined out three, four thousand acres. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7444.0599999999995s)]
*  And so out of those three, four thousand acres, you've extracted all these bones. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7449.5s)]
*  But only out of five acres, you've extracted these bones. [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7452.94s)]
*  Five acres, but the company didn't save bones. [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7455.58s)]
*  They were all taken to AMNH in New York City. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7457.66s)]
*  So it's possible that you've only scratched the surface of what's at your place. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7460.139999999999s)]
*  Not impossible. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7468.139999999999s)]
*  That's what happens. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7468.86s)]
*  We have just barely touched it. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7470.94s)]
*  We're only talking an area. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7473.66s)]
*  Five acres. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7476.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7477.5s)]
*  With the witches. [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7478.86s)]
*  It's a really nice giant piece of land with a house on it. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7479.74s)]
*  The fact that you've got this many animals from that relatively small piece of property [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7485.259999999999s)]
*  is just fucking insane. [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7490.0599999999995s)]
*  Well, and like I said, the next creek down is a mile long. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7491.66s)]
*  This is a gulch. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7496.3s)]
*  And the next creek down, you're finding stuff there too. [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7497.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7500.46s)]
*  Jesus. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7501.82s)]
*  And we're able to use stuff these days that they didn't have back in the day, like drones. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7502.78s)]
*  You can fly up a creek and see if there's something laying on the top. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7508.0599999999995s)]
*  And that's just what's laying on the top. [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7512.78s)]
*  Yeah, just sitting on top. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7514.62s)]
*  The other significant thing that we haven't talked about is the wood [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7516.3s)]
*  that is abundant in that area. [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7519.9s)]
*  This was all grasslands back in the day. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7523.58s)]
*  These are all grazers. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7525.9s)]
*  The caribou, the bison, they're all grazers. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7527.099999999999s)]
*  Carnivores are not grazers. [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7533.42s)]
*  They're meat eaters. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7535.259999999999s)]
*  For thousands of years, they had a nice balance of, you know, everybody's happy. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7537.0199999999995s)]
*  But, you know, suddenly things changed. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7542.139999999999s)]
*  It went from grasslands to forested lands because it became, [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7545.9s)]
*  it left the ice age and became uplands. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7551.099999999999s)]
*  And uplands is where people like to build their houses [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7554.0599999999995s)]
*  because there's basically a little permafrost under it. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7557.259999999999s)]
*  So a lot of the housing in Fairbanks is on the south slope of a hill. [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7561.1s)]
*  And you sometimes see people that build on permafrost. [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7565.02s)]
*  And if you do that, you're asking for trouble [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7567.900000000001s)]
*  because the ground's melting underneath your house. [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7570.86s)]
*  And that's good if you're in the landfill business [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7574.14s)]
*  and you have a construction debris landfill because that's where they end up. [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7576.54s)]
*  Because the houses start to sink. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7580.3s)]
*  Somebody has to go in, they tear them up, they take them out to us. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7582.54s)]
*  And we'll take care of it for you. [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7586.06s)]
*  And the other significant thing we haven't talked about is [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7587.9800000000005s)]
*  we've only found the big stuff. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7591.02s)]
*  But that water's running down a drain. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7593.9800000000005s)]
*  And we take the excavator in there and we dig that drain out pretty regularly. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7597.42s)]
*  And we stack all that material up. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7601.5s)]
*  I would wager, pretty much everything I own, [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7604.14s)]
*  that there are millions of microfossils in that material. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7607.18s)]
*  And millions. [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7612.78s)]
*  We're talking. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7614.9400000000005s)]
*  We're talking claws, teeth, little tiny things [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7616.38s)]
*  that get caught in the current and go downstream. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7620.62s)]
*  We bail them out, we stack them up. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7624.3s)]
*  We're not going to spend the time with a hand screen and go through it. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7626.54s)]
*  Someday somebody might. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7630.38s)]
*  Might be one of my grandkids' kids. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7632.38s)]
*  You know, we're in this for the long haul. [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7635.42s)]
*  And you were saying the trees, the wood? [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7636.78s)]
*  Yeah, there's, we, sometimes you strip off the permafrost [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7639.099999999999s)]
*  and there's trees underneath that stuff. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7643.0199999999995s)]
*  Whole trees. [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7645.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7646.46s)]
*  We dug a permafrost tunnel in nearby. [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7647.9s)]
*  Came in probably 40 feet, 30 feet below the permafrost. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7651.34s)]
*  There's trees growing in it. [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7658.62s)]
*  There's old trees that were there. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7660.0599999999995s)]
*  And it kind of meshes with that theory that there used to be no moose up there. [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7663.82s)]
*  Because they're not grazers. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7669.9s)]
*  You know, they're a different breed of animal altogether. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7672.22s)]
*  They eat willows, they eat trees, they eat that kind of stuff. [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7675.18s)]
*  And not so much grass. [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7679.26s)]
*  So there was a transition and there was a big, well, there's no moose up here. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7682.7s)]
*  Well, they, in that film, you saw those guys discover three moose bones inside [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7686.38s)]
*  one of our collection areas. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7692.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7694.22s)]
*  That heretofore they never thought existed up there during the Ice Age. [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7695.34s)]
*  So that's significant. [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7699.18s)]
*  Could have been right at the transition. [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7701.42s)]
*  It's got a carbon date. [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7704.38s)]
*  It costs 400 bucks a pop. [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7705.42s)]
*  It just seems to me that this is so big and so important. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7709.5s)]
*  It's bizarre that it hasn't gotten more attention. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7714.38s)]
*  You know why that is. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7719.1s)]
*  I'm only going to talk to Joe Rogan about it. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7722.3s)]
*  You think I'm bullshitting. [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7725.58s)]
*  No, I believe you. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7726.54s)]
*  I've used you as a crutch for years. [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7727.34s)]
*  I appreciate that. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7730.3s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7731.660000000001s)]
*  You don't know? [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7733.1s)]
*  I'm glad you appreciate it, but that explains why nobody knows what we're doing. [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7735.42s)]
*  Wow. [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7742.22s)]
*  But don't you think this is important for science, important for the human race and [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7743.660000000001s)]
*  our understanding of the past, and this is not as simple as just a pile of bones. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7750.700000000001s)]
*  This is of great historical importance. [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7757.26s)]
*  I agree with you 100%. [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7760.86s)]
*  That's why we collect them. [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7762.62s)]
*  What do you think is going to happen to all of them though? [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7765.259999999999s)]
*  Have you thought of it? [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7767.0199999999995s)]
*  One of those guys that knows what he's talking about is going to have to come up and identify [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7769.98s)]
*  him. They're going to have to figure it out. [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7773.5s)]
*  It's not my job to figure it out. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7775.66s)]
*  I don't have time or the expertise. [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7777.099999999999s)]
*  They must shit their pants when they get up there. [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7778.94s)]
*  If you've had guys come up there before and they see all the stuff you have. [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7781.42s)]
*  Well, the couple that you saw on that video, [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7784.94s)]
*  one of the very few people that I've ever allowed in there to look at it. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7788.620000000001s)]
*  And the only reason that was is because the filmmaker was making a documentary. [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7791.740000000001s)]
*  When they got up there and they saw that, what was their initial response? [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7795.740000000001s)]
*  They couldn't believe it. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7800.14s)]
*  They still can't believe it. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7801.9800000000005s)]
*  One guy offered to come up and categorize everything. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7804.3s)]
*  That was Dick Moe. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7809.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7810.9400000000005s)]
*  I said, well, we're not done yet. [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7813.18s)]
*  We're not done yet. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7815.98s)]
*  We're going to keep working. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7818.0599999999995s)]
*  So it hasn't happened yet. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7820.46s)]
*  It seems like it should. [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7823.179999999999s)]
*  Oh, it should. [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7824.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7825.099999999999s)]
*  But it's going to cost somebody a lot of money to do it. [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7826.139999999999s)]
*  And I'm not going to pay for it. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7829.5s)]
*  Right. Of course. [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7830.86s)]
*  Because this is just a hobby. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7831.82s)]
*  But then also you have to be careful of who you allow. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7832.7s)]
*  That's right. [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7835.5s)]
*  And whether or not they get righteous and want to take it from you. [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7838.219999999999s)]
*  Which they like to do sometimes. [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7843.98s)]
*  That's why we never find anything of archaeological value. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7845.98s)]
*  It's a whole different set of laws. [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7851.9s)]
*  Have you ever found anything of archaeological value? [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7854.06s)]
*  I mean, theoretically, hypothetically. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7857.58s)]
*  Well, I got it. [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7860.54s)]
*  If you did. [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7861.1s)]
*  If you found like weapon points or something like that. [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7861.42s)]
*  I have a skinning tool that I posted. [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7866.22s)]
*  Really? [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7869.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7869.9s)]
*  If Jamie can find that. [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7870.86s)]
*  How recent is that? [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7872.86s)]
*  Do you post it? [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7873.74s)]
*  I posted a lot of this stuff in the last few weeks anticipating this. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7875.5s)]
*  So it wouldn't be hard for him to find it. [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7880.54s)]
*  That's not it. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7883.26s)]
*  That looks like a tooth. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7884.7s)]
*  Is that a tooth? [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7885.9s)]
*  That's a tool? [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7887.02s)]
*  Let's see here. [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7887.66s)]
*  Within the last few weeks? [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7891.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7892.46s)]
*  That's a scapula. [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7895.82s)]
*  Yeah, with a point tip that apparently stuck in it. [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7896.78s)]
*  Oh, there was a tip stuck in the scapula? [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7902.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7905.26s)]
*  Click on that. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7907.1s)]
*  Oh, whoa. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7907.820000000001s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7910.860000000001s)]
*  So that is something, a spear or an arrow or something that went through that? [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7913.42s)]
*  If you scroll a few more of those pictures, you'll see there's an elk, by the way, [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7917.900000000001s)]
*  an elk skull that we found. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7923.820000000001s)]
*  They didn't live up there, by the way. [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7926.38s)]
*  Okay, there's a ground squirrel in my hand there. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7930.22s)]
*  That's a ground squirrel jaw skull. [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7934.22s)]
*  So where's this tool? [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7938.86s)]
*  Is it up or down? [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7941.9s)]
*  There's a bunch of stuff. [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7945.98s)]
*  If you scroll down a little bit, Jamie, to the right side, what is that? [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7947.58s)]
*  What is that? [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7950.54s)]
*  Those are all a bunch of spear points and arrowheads that were found on my ground. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7950.94s)]
*  Were shipped to the AMNH and ended up in Wisconsin where they were lost for 15 years. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7958.0599999999995s)]
*  They found them now? [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7964.54s)]
*  Somebody tracked them down. [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7965.9s)]
*  Those are all from our ground. [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7969.18s)]
*  So how old do they think those are? [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7971.66s)]
*  Keep scrolling and I'll see if... [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7977.0199999999995s)]
*  It's got a big gold scale sitting on a gold scale. [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7980.14s)]
*  Is that your golden retriever? [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7983.26s)]
*  Yeah, my daughter's golden retriever. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7985.0199999999995s)]
*  Go a little bit farther, I think. [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7987.82s)]
*  No, that was a little thing I made. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7989.5s)]
*  Hey, you like that caribou, go up a little bit. [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7994.0599999999995s)]
*  Where? [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=7999.9s)]
*  Right there. [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8000.54s)]
*  Right there? [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8001.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8001.58s)]
*  Someone carved a face into it? [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8003.66s)]
*  Looks like a face. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8006.22s)]
*  Did you find it like that? [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8008.62s)]
*  Yeah, laying on top of a tailing pile, 10 miles below the boneyard. [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8009.74s)]
*  So it looks like somebody... [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8014.38s)]
*  Yeah, that totally looks like a face, like somebody was working on it. [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8015.74s)]
*  Yep. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8019.26s)]
*  Wow. [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8020.86s)]
*  Go back to the thing... [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8022.32s)]
*  Let's try to find those tools. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8023.2s)]
*  So those arrowheads, what time do they date those things to? [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8025.2s)]
*  I don't know if they ever did anything with them. [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8030.4s)]
*  They just went from Fairbanks to New York City. [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8032.639999999999s)]
*  So nobody had any speculation or nothing? [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8036.08s)]
*  There's another dire wolf skull on the right there. [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8039.759999999999s)]
*  Go down there, Jamie. [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8042.32s)]
*  Pull that click of black up, up, up, up. [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8043.28s)]
*  That's a badger right there. [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8045.92s)]
*  No, it's up a little bit further, Jamie. [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8047.2s)]
*  Yeah, right there to the right. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8049.28s)]
*  That's it. [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8050.64s)]
*  Whoa, look how dark it is. [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8052.4800000000005s)]
*  Is that dark from the muck? [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8055.360000000001s)]
*  It's dark from being wet. [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8056.72s)]
*  We had just found it. [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8058.0s)]
*  Wow. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8059.12s)]
*  And so they didn't think dire wolves lived up there? [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8061.76s)]
*  No. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8064.320000000001s)]
*  So have they altered their history books now? [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8065.52s)]
*  Yeah, it seems like they're trying to a little bit. [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8069.360000000001s)]
*  I'm gonna get on my phone and see if I can find that. [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8073.52s)]
*  Look at that mushroom popping out of that ice. [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8076.08s)]
*  Wow. [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8078.08s)]
*  There's a lot of flora that we don't even know. [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8079.22s)]
*  It grows there in the silt that comes down. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8082.58s)]
*  It just starts sprouting immediately. [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8084.98s)]
*  And I'm thinking it's Ice Age stuff. [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8088.42s)]
*  Whoa, Ice Age stuff that the seeds are in there [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8090.66s)]
*  and then once the warm air hits them. [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8093.54s)]
*  Boom. [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8095.86s)]
*  Wow. [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8096.9s)]
*  And it's not found in any other areas around where I'm at. [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8097.4s)]
*  I mean, it's right there at the bone yard. [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8100.74s)]
*  You gotta bring some botanists in there too, then. [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8103.54s)]
*  I don't want to. [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8105.78s)]
*  Wow. [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8107.14s)]
*  I just want to collect the stuff. [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8108.26s)]
*  I get it. [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8110.18s)]
*  And find somebody who's got as much interest in history [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8110.74s)]
*  as you do to go up and do it. [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8114.66s)]
*  Oh, I'm sure there's people listening right now [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8116.98s)]
*  that are chomping at the bit. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8118.9s)]
*  Because it seems like you have one of the most unique places [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8121.14s)]
*  on Earth. [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8123.86s)]
*  I think so. [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8124.58s)]
*  It's just so crazy. [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8126.18s)]
*  It's just five acre chunk. [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8127.3s)]
*  What is significant about it? [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8130.9s)]
*  Like, what is it about that area? [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8133.3s)]
*  I mean, is there any speculation as to why they would all wind up there? [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8135.14s)]
*  The next creek up, which is a major tributary, [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8139.46s)]
*  it's where Gold Daughters is at, is another creek. [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8142.02s)]
*  And when they put the pipeline through there, [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8146.660000000001s)]
*  they were digging down to bedrock and trying to find a firm base [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8148.42s)]
*  for their VSMs, which are the pipes that hold it up in the air. [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8151.700000000001s)]
*  Finding all kinds of tusks. [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8156.58s)]
*  All kinds of tusks. [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8158.02s)]
*  It's just everywhere up there. [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8159.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8160.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8161.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8161.96s)]
*  Like the guy that built that pipe, Mammoth Mogul, [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8163.8s)]
*  he also made a... [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8168.92s)]
*  His name is Mammoth Mogul? [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8170.28s)]
*  His Instagram is Mammoth Mogul. [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8171.8s)]
*  Call him Mammoth Mogul. [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8173.0s)]
*  Mammoth underscore mogul. [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8174.6s)]
*  I think that's what he has. [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8177.96s)]
*  It's M-O-G-A-L or M-O-G-U-L. [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8179.56s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8182.4400000000005s)]
*  But they don't know why. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8185.96s)]
*  No one has come to you and said, [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8188.4400000000005s)]
*  hey, John, I think this is why. [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8189.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8191.72s)]
*  I get all kinds of people that think that's why. [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8192.22s)]
*  But what do they think? [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8194.36s)]
*  Why do they think all those animals in this one spot? [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8195.56s)]
*  They don't have a clue. [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8197.96s)]
*  Even the people in that film who are experts have no idea. [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8199.88s)]
*  And there's no place that's remotely similar to this [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8205.72s)]
*  in terms of the amount of stuff that they pulled out of one area? [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8208.6s)]
*  If there is, they're not talking about it. [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8211.56s)]
*  Let's say they're on state property, state claim. [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8216.12s)]
*  They can be shut down like right now. [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8219.16s)]
*  So they would probably keep their mouth shut and just keep doing it. [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8221.96s)]
*  I would think so. [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8224.039999999999s)]
*  This is patented land that we own from the service to the center of the planet. [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8225.24s)]
*  It's the highest property bundle of property rights you can acquire. [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8231.16s)]
*  We own it. [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8237.24s)]
*  It's not playing mother may I with the state or the feds. [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8238.36s)]
*  If you find it on native land, it's theirs. [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8242.36s)]
*  You're not even allowed to touch it. [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8245.96s)]
*  If you see a tusk in a creek, and this actually happened, [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8247.8s)]
*  it was on native corporation land. [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8253.08s)]
*  Guy picked the tusk up, put it in his airplane, lost his airplane. [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8255.56s)]
*  Got confiscated. [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8260.119999999999s)]
*  What do those folks do with it when they find them on native land? [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8263.16s)]
*  Don't know. [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8268.039999999999s)]
*  It seems like this very- [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8269.56s)]
*  They're allowed to collect it. [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8271.16s)]
*  They're allowed to do that. [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8273.08s)]
*  This whole thing seems like this very unusual moment that needs to be capitalized on. [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8274.84s)]
*  This crazy spot, what you've done, and even what you're doing. [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8281.800000000001s)]
*  You're just continually extracting history. [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8286.84s)]
*  It just seems so important. [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8292.2s)]
*  It is. [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8294.2s)]
*  Just so crazy that it's a guy who's a miner just happened to find that shit. [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8294.36s)]
*  Just like put it over there. [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8299.0s)]
*  There. [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8300.04s)]
*  Well, here's the downside of being crazy. [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8301.320000000002s)]
*  Because we have a lot of good mine on the ground. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8305.800000000001s)]
*  Here it is, Mammoth Mogul. [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8309.320000000002s)]

*  Go to that tusk that he has, Jamie. [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8317.320000000002s)]
*  Look at that, man. [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8318.84s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8320.84s)]
*  I tell people, if you ever have a chance to acquire one of his carvings, just do it. [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8321.640000000001s)]
*  You can thank me later. [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8325.480000000001s)]

*  Go down there, that head thing to the left of the hat. [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8348.76s)]
*  I think that's the one I have. [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8353.480000000001s)]

*  I think that's one of mine now. [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8359.56s)]
*  If he puts it up on his site and I see it before somebody buys it, I buy it. [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8362.84s)]
*  Really? [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8367.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8367.56s)]

*  No, not that I know of. [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8389.9s)]
*  What happens if you find dinosaurs? [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8391.1s)]
*  Is it the same deal? [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8392.460000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8393.26s)]
*  I think the dinosaurs mostly are up on the north slope. [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8395.1s)]
*  That's where they've been finding them. [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8398.7s)]
*  They're pretty secretive about where to. [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8401.02s)]
*  Do you ever stop and think how crazy it is that it's you, [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8403.34s)]
*  that you are the guy who has found this stuff? [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8407.1s)]
*  You're the guy who owns this piece of property. [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8410.220000000001s)]
*  You're the guy who stumbled upon one of the greatest [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8411.82s)]
*  historical sites in all of paleontology? [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8415.98s)]
*  I don't know if we have that. [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8419.66s)]
*  But going back to the crazy part of it, [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8421.74s)]
*  I've got 10,000 acres of really good mining property. [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8426.94s)]
*  I haven't been mining that little piece, [[02:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8431.5s)]
*  even though I know there's a lot of gold there [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8433.26s)]
*  because we have the drill logs. [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8434.699999999999s)]
*  Right below it, the miner took out 3,000 ounces [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8436.699999999999s)]
*  in about a four-acre piece of land. [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8439.18s)]
*  So it kind of goes up. [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8441.98s)]
*  For years, I had a guy working with me going, [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8443.98s)]
*  fuck these bones. [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8446.94s)]
*  Let's just go mining. [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8447.74s)]
*  What are you doing? [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8448.779999999999s)]
*  What are you doing? [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8450.539999999999s)]
*  Other people. [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8451.1s)]
*  That guy's fucking nutter, man. [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8451.66s)]
*  He's out there all day just picking up bones. [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8453.74s)]
*  It's not true. [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8456.699999999999s)]
*  We turned the giant on, the autogiant, [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8458.06s)]
*  and we just let it run, [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8459.98s)]
*  and we'll come back in a couple hours and see what we found. [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8460.86s)]
*  And Dick Mull, when he was up there, he liked this. [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8464.3s)]
*  He was on a private little conversation. [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8467.9s)]
*  He says, John, tell me, [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8470.06s)]
*  do you have your bones and your collection insured? [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8473.26s)]
*  I said, excuse me. [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8476.779999999999s)]
*  He says, do you have your collection insured? [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8477.82s)]
*  I said, what do you mean, do I have my collection insured? [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8480.939999999999s)]
*  He says, well, it's valuable. [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8482.939999999999s)]
*  Do you have it insured? [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8484.779999999999s)]
*  I said, no, I never even thought about it. [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8485.66s)]
*  Well, you should think about it. [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8488.06s)]
*  I said, Dick, okay, help me out here. [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8489.5s)]
*  What should I insure it for? [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8492.14s)]
*  If I was you, I'd insure it for $450 million. [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8495.9s)]
*  He says, it's not worth that, though. [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8500.46s)]
*  It's only worth $150 million, but you always insure heavy. [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8501.9s)]
*  I said, are you serious? [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8506.939999999999s)]
*  He goes, yeah. [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8508.46s)]
*  Now, after that conversation, I got back in my truck and went, [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8510.22s)]
*  all right, that was fucking crazy. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8515.9s)]
*  You think I'm crazy? [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8518.619999999999s)]
*  Fuck that, I'm crazy. [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8520.539999999999s)]
*  But I felt vindicated, you know what I'm saying? [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8523.98s)]
*  Oh, for sure. [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8525.98s)]
*  For somebody to even think it's even close to something like that. [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8526.699999999999s)]
*  And because, like I said, it's just a hobby. [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8530.539999999999s)]
*  I'm trying to put myself in your shoes. [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8533.5s)]
*  Okay. [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8535.019999999999s)]
*  I'm trying to imagine if I was you and I stumbled across this, [[02:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8535.5s)]
*  if I would do anything different. [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8538.22s)]
*  No, you wouldn't. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8539.42s)]
*  I don't think I would. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8539.98s)]
*  No, you do the same fucking thing I'm doing. [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8540.779999999999s)]
*  I probably wouldn't talk about it on the podcast, though. [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8543.58s)]
*  No, you'd have just talked to yourself. [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8545.58s)]
*  I'd tell Jamie. [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8548.06s)]
*  You'd just be talking to yourself. [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8549.82s)]
*  I would put our phones in a fucking Ziploc bag and put them in a safe [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8551.1s)]
*  and then have a conversation with them. [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8554.46s)]
*  Here's you out there. [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8555.9s)]
*  Just like unedited footage on YouTube, just a bunch of stuff. [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8560.06s)]
*  My son Kenzie did a lot of filming back in the early days. [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8563.82s)]
*  I do love the fact that you document all this stuff and you do put it online. [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8567.019999999999s)]
*  I mean, I think that's pretty fucking cool. [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8570.539999999999s)]
*  And there's a piece of mammoth ivory and heads and bones and shit. [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8572.539999999999s)]
*  Is that a day's collection? [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8577.26s)]
*  Just all stuff you caught in a day? [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8578.539999999999s)]
*  Probably a couple days. [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8581.26s)]
*  So amazing, man. [[02:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8583.34s)]
*  I mean, I know you realize how fortunate you are. [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8585.66s)]
*  But I mean, amongst all the people that have ever lived, [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8588.859999999999s)]
*  how many people have ever found a spot like this? [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8592.619999999999s)]
*  It's fucking bunk. [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8597.18s)]
*  It's hard for me to imagine why they're all there. [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8598.14s)]
*  Like trying to look on the map. [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8601.9s)]
*  Where is this it? [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8604.859999999999s)]
*  The area? [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8606.939999999999s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8607.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8608.14s)]
*  Okay. [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8608.539999999999s)]
*  We've done this stuff with Graham and Randall, you know, so like looking at the map, [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8611.1s)]
*  it seems like there was a flood. [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8614.619999999999s)]
*  Go up and see where it says Gold Reg. [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8616.539999999999s)]
*  Yeah, right here. [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8618.46s)]
*  Now zoom in on that. [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8619.1s)]
*  See where it says Gold Reg 8? [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8621.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8623.26s)]
*  Now go to the left of that. [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8624.06s)]
*  See that body of water right there? [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8625.82s)]
*  Down. [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8628.06s)]
*  No, no, no. [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8628.3s)]
*  Oh, this like right here? [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8628.86s)]
*  Right. [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8629.98s)]
*  Boom. [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8630.46s)]
*  And now go right to where it says Calder Creek. [[02:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8631.58s)]
*  Come up this way or up the other way. [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8634.06s)]
*  The other down right there. [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8637.1s)]
*  Oh, I see right here. [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8639.58s)]
*  All right. [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8640.46s)]
*  Now go where it meets. [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8640.699999999999s)]
*  Oh, no, go upwards towards the pond right there. [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8642.539999999999s)]
*  That's it. [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8647.9s)]
*  Right there. [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8648.699999999999s)]
*  So zoom out and get this sort of topological view of it. [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8651.82s)]
*  But the thing is it's like, so you think that they died and then floods might have [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8657.66s)]
*  carried them there. [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8662.779999999999s)]
*  So if it was like a mass extinction. [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8663.74s)]
*  Do you see that big body of earth moving stuff up there? [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8665.74s)]
*  Go to the right of Fox. [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8671.58s)]
*  Go up a little bit. [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8674.62s)]
*  Right to the left there. [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8677.42s)]
*  No, to the right now. [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8680.140000000001s)]
*  I see Fox there. [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8682.54s)]
*  I saw it. [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8683.42s)]
*  Go to the right of that. [[02:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8683.820000000002s)]
*  You see that right there. [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8684.7s)]
*  That's the Fort Knox mine. [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8687.02s)]
*  That's the largest. [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8688.62s)]
*  Oh, God. [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8689.42s)]
*  How gross is that? [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8689.740000000002s)]
*  Largest open pit mine in North America. [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8691.02s)]
*  Look how big it is. [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8692.380000000001s)]
*  Ugh. [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8693.42s)]
*  Now if you go down Fairbanks Creek from there, you'll see off to the right. [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8693.980000000001s)]
*  Go up a little bit now. [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8701.58s)]
*  Keep going right a little bit more. [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8706.300000000001s)]
*  Don't stop. [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8708.380000000001s)]
*  Just go straight up to the left. [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8709.18s)]
*  Up more and go to the left. [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8715.26s)]
*  Right there. [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8717.58s)]
*  Okay. [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8718.86s)]
*  Right to the left there. [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8719.900000000001s)]
*  The little right boom. [[02:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8721.42s)]
*  Okay. [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8722.7s)]
*  You're looking at my mouse pointer. [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8723.02s)]
*  I see. [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8724.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8725.660000000002s)]
*  What's that? [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8727.58s)]
*  Now you go. [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8728.38s)]
*  You see that? [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8729.099999999999s)]
*  That's a big pond. [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8729.74s)]
*  Now over here on the stop to the left of that, over there on the side, you see that dredge [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8730.619999999999s)]
*  sitting there. [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8736.779999999999s)]
*  We call that Geordie's dredge. [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8738.619999999999s)]
*  That's named after my daughter Jordan. [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8740.22s)]
*  And that's where we took the family picnicking. [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8743.179999999998s)]
*  And for years, I put it on the National Register because I like the Restoral stuff. [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8747.099999999999s)]
*  Something to do. [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8753.74s)]
*  It's just so fascinating when you look at the sheer scope of the land out there and [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8754.38s)]
*  you think of this one five acre patch that you've pulled all these bones from. [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8763.74s)]
*  And then you imagine how much more is out there. [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8770.699999999999s)]
*  How much more hasn't been excavated? [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8773.66s)]
*  How much more of that land has a similar situation going on in it? [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8776.3s)]
*  The only land there that's been excavated is land that has gold on it. [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8781.02s)]
*  There's no point in excavating the rest of it. [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8786.140000000001s)]
*  But if someone found a similar sort of scenario and they started blowing water into the [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8788.140000000001s)]
*  mountainside, they might be able to pull things out of there too. [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8795.26s)]
*  It might be everywhere up there. [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8798.460000000001s)]
*  Well, if it's state or federal land, which most all the property is, you're not going [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8799.74s)]
*  to get a permit to do that. [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8805.1s)]
*  But it feels like paleontologists could. [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8807.9s)]
*  No. [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8811.82s)]
*  No? [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8812.380000000001s)]
*  Even federal agencies that try to do deals with the feds have problems with the feds [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8814.86s)]
*  permitting process. [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8820.62s)]
*  Even scientists? [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8823.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8824.460000000001s)]
*  It just seems like it's so important. [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8825.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8827.9s)]
*  There's been some really incredible things that our company has been participating in [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8832.140000000001s)]
*  because we do have a lot of private property. [[02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8836.94s)]
*  We rezoned Chattanooga, which is one of the other areas up there that's one of the richest [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8839.02s)]
*  creeks in the state is Cleary Creek. [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8845.02s)]
*  And that's leased out to a gold miner out of the Yukon. [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8847.66s)]
*  But we rezoned that to a private rocket range several years ago. [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8852.94s)]
*  Rocket range? [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8858.78s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8859.58s)]
*  Did you rent it out to Elon? [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8860.94s)]
*  It's right next to Poker Flats Rocket Range, which is a university rocket range. [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8863.18s)]
*  But theirs is all on wetlands, permafrost, and mine's all uplands. [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8867.58s)]
*  So if Elon, if you're listening, call me. [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8873.42s)]
*  Because I know he does listen to you. [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8878.220000000001s)]
*  God, I'm getting his time right now. [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8880.300000000001s)]
*  I can write him a permit to launch a rocket on a cocktail napkin. [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8881.82s)]
*  Only people he's have to talk to after that is FAA. [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8887.26s)]
*  Well, they do it all down here. [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8889.98s)]
*  Yeah, they do. [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8891.42s)]
*  But someday they might want to start launching a rocket. [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8892.14s)]
*  Doing it out of Alaska because of its location to the high Arctic. [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8897.18s)]
*  And he sent a lot of his satellites are going up around the high Arctic to [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8901.18s)]
*  interconnect with that area that nobody else has done. [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8907.98s)]
*  Now, what would someone do if they were building something like that [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8912.220000000001s)]
*  and they stumbled upon a mammoth bone? [[02:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8914.78s)]
*  What would I do? [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8917.42s)]
*  I'd put it in my truck. [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8919.02s)]
*  Wouldn't they keep digging? [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8921.66s)]
*  Well, I'd get the next one too. [[02:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8923.34s)]
*  Do you feel like you almost have like a bounty of riches with this stuff, [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8924.62s)]
*  where it's like so much that you're not even appreciating it for what it is? [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8927.980000000001s)]
*  Is that possible? [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8934.380000000001s)]
*  Because you're just so accustomed to discovering it? [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8935.740000000002s)]
*  No, it's just that I don't need the money. [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8938.460000000001s)]
*  I mean, not even money. [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8941.980000000001s)]
*  I don't even mean in terms of money. [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8944.380000000001s)]
*  I mean, in terms of like how incredible it is. [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8945.740000000002s)]
*  It is absolutely incredible. [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8949.02s)]
*  And I take a long view of history. [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8951.1s)]
*  The shit that we're doing right now, I won't be around to see happen. [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8953.98s)]
*  But it's going to happen. [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8957.58s)]
*  It took us 15 years just to collect what we got. [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8959.58s)]
*  And you've only scratched the surface. [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8963.34s)]
*  Just a little bit. [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8964.94s)]
*  Not only that, but that area to the next creek down, [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8966.86s)]
*  the entire area from where we're at down to the next creek down [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8972.300000000001s)]
*  is going to have incredible amounts too. [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8976.300000000001s)]
*  How much money have you spent doing this? [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8981.02s)]
*  Well, I haven't spent a shit. [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8985.58s)]
*  I haven't spent anything talking to my wife there [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8986.7s)]
*  because she thinks it's my hobby. [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8989.66s)]
*  But if someone else did it. [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8992.62s)]
*  It cost them because you see the tools we use. [[02:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8994.140000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8996.7s)]
*  And 15 years of doing this. [[02:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8998.140000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=8999.74s)]
*  Fuel. [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9000.060000000001s)]
*  Labor, fuel, machines. [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9000.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9002.300000000001s)]
*  It's just so crazy. [[02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9004.62s)]
*  It's like a homegrown operation. [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9005.58s)]
*  It's just a small, just a little outfit. [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9007.82s)]
*  But is there anything like this anywhere else in the world [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9009.98s)]
*  that you're aware of? [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9012.3s)]
*  No. [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9013.18s)]
*  Imagine if you weren't there. [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9017.1s)]
*  That's what's so crazy to me. [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9018.46s)]
*  If you weren't there, if you didn't discover dire wolf skulls, [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9020.14s)]
*  saber-toothed tiger skulls, elk skulls, moose skulls. [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9024.38s)]
*  If you didn't discover all these animals, [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9028.779999999999s)]
*  they wouldn't even think those animals were there. [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9030.939999999999s)]
*  They would confidently state those animals did not exist [[02:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9033.34s)]
*  during that time in that area. [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9037.66s)]
*  And they continue to say that. [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9038.94s)]
*  But they're taking some minor steps to go, [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9040.94s)]
*  well, the dire wolves actually did live up there. [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9045.34s)]
*  Now they're saying that. [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9049.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9050.060000000001s)]
*  Now they're saying it. [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9050.300000000001s)]
*  Well, duh. [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9051.1s)]
*  I got half a dozen of them sitting on my bookshelf. [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9052.380000000001s)]
*  Half a dozen dire wolf skulls on your bookshelf. [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9054.54s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9058.62s)]
*  How big is a dire wolf skull? [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9059.18s)]
*  About yay long. [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9061.58s)]
*  Damn. [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9062.54s)]
*  That's got to be worth a lot of money. [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9063.66s)]
*  Probably. [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9065.18s)]
*  I would imagine. [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9065.980000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9066.94s)]
*  Someone bought a dire wolf skull online? [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9067.9s)]
*  Christie's had an auction or something like that? [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9071.42s)]
*  You could probably find people that are selling them. [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9073.5s)]
*  I guarantee. [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9075.42s)]
*  See if you can find a dire wolf skull for sale. [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9076.3s)]
*  The other thing I was talking about, [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9080.06s)]
*  the skinning knife that we found. [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9081.02s)]
*  I have friends that are hard rock geologists. [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9082.46s)]
*  They're some of the best on the planet that know where [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9085.18s)]
*  minerals are in Alaska, know where the valuable rocks are, [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9088.539999999999s)]
*  of all kind of metals. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9091.74s)]
*  And the skinning knife I took to a fella, [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9093.74s)]
*  probably one of the best hard rock geologists that I know, [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9095.82s)]
*  or in fact he is. [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9098.38s)]
*  And I said, Kurt, where did this come from? [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9100.62s)]
*  What kind of rock is this? [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9103.9s)]
*  And he looked at it. [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9106.62s)]
*  He goes, it's not from Alaska. [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9107.42s)]
*  That rock is not from Alaska. [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9111.58s)]
*  I said, where is that type of rock found? [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9114.62s)]
*  He goes, Eastern Europe. [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9116.7s)]
*  Whoa. [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9119.82s)]
*  Now, [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9120.62s)]
*  Bulgaria, Romania, one of those areas. [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9121.5s)]
*  That's what he said. [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9124.78s)]
*  So someone, some ancient historical person [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9126.7s)]
*  came from Bulgaria or Eastern Europe [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9130.94s)]
*  with stone tools and made their way to your property. [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9133.98s)]
*  And not only that, but let's say you're gonna take a long trip. [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9138.7s)]
*  You're gonna pack more than one pair of underwear. [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9143.02s)]
*  So let's take some of that and let's say [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9146.22s)]
*  you're gonna pack more than one pair of underwear. [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9148.54s)]
*  So let's take some of this rock with us. [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9150.380000000001s)]
*  We're never gonna know when we might need to make some more flint tools, [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9152.300000000001s)]
*  arrowhead, spear tips. [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9155.660000000002s)]
*  Probably loaded up a sled full of that kind of rock. [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9157.660000000002s)]
*  Drug it all the way across Europe. [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9161.660000000002s)]
*  Thousands of miles. [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9164.140000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9165.42s)]
*  Went across the Bering Land Bridge. [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9166.220000000001s)]
*  And this promontory where this was found is an incredible story. [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9169.980000000001s)]
*  Because if what I hadn't done prior to that didn't happen, [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9174.140000000001s)]
*  I would have never found it. [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9178.22s)]
*  And that was, there's a letter I posted from a Brigadier General [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9180.3s)]
*  that the last line is really good. [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9184.859999999999s)]
*  Your contribution to the safety of America cannot be overestimated. [[02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9187.42s)]
*  Pull that letter up. [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9194.06s)]
*  How are you contributing to the safety of America? [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9195.099999999999s)]
*  I got a call one day [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9203.019999999999s)]
*  from a friend who owns a bunkhouse up on the Cleary Summit. [[02:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9204.539999999999s)]
*  He goes, John, I got some guys up here who'd like to talk to you. [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9210.14s)]
*  I said, okay, I'll be right up. [[02:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9213.58s)]
*  He says, I'll let them explain it. [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9217.1s)]
*  So I get up there and I go into his bunkhouse, which is big. [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9219.019999999999s)]
*  And on the floor is all kinds of technology, cables, machinery, boxes, travel, kind of high tech stuff. [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9223.74s)]
*  And about 15 guys milling around in there working. [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9233.259999999998s)]
*  And I met the guy in charge. [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9237.42s)]
*  I go, what's up? [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9238.779999999999s)]
*  He says, I understand that you have a lot of land. [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9239.5s)]
*  He says, I'm up here doing a test for the Air Force. [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9243.58s)]
*  And our permit expired before we were able to get moving. [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9248.06s)]
*  And we need a place to do this experiment. [[02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9253.099999999999s)]
*  I said, what's the experiment? [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9256.859999999999s)]
*  He goes, you see all these guys. [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9258.38s)]
*  I go, yeah, those are acoustic engineers. [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9261.74s)]
*  Now, Joe, I've never even seen an acoustic engineer before. [[02:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9265.1s)]
*  Suddenly I got 15 of them in the same room. [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9270.619999999999s)]
*  I said, what are we studying? [[02:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9273.98s)]
*  Well, we're trying to improve the bunker buster. [[02:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9276.46s)]
*  What's the problem with the bunker buster? [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9281.82s)]
*  It's not working right. [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9284.06s)]
*  It's not going deep enough in Afghanistan. [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9285.1s)]
*  We want it to penetrate the earth farther. [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9287.58s)]
*  So we're going to lay out a bunch of grids. [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9290.38s)]
*  We're going to do some explosions. [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9291.98s)]
*  We're going to measure the sound waves or whatever they do. [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9293.74s)]
*  But we got no place to do it now. [[02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9298.7s)]
*  And we got everybody here. [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9300.06s)]
*  Steve here saying that you can probably accommodate us. [[02:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9301.98s)]
*  And I said, sure, I can. [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9305.58s)]
*  I got a lot of land. [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9308.54s)]
*  I said, but why are you testing it in Alaska? [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9311.02s)]
*  Why aren't you testing it in Utah or the lower 48 some place? [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9315.18s)]
*  What do you need to come up here for? [[02:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9319.42s)]
*  Well, we want to do it in permafrost. [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9321.34s)]
*  I said, Afghanistan doesn't have permafrost. [[02:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9324.54s)]
*  Not that I'm aware of, especially for a bunker buster. [[02:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9329.34s)]
*  I said, this don't sound right to me. [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9334.22s)]
*  He goes, step outside. [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9337.26s)]
*  So we go outside. [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9340.78s)]
*  I said, what the fuck are we doing here? [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9341.66s)]
*  He goes, North Korea is buying atomic weapons from Russia. [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9344.699999999999s)]
*  Those atomic weapons are being experimented with and tested in permafrost. [[02:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9352.06s)]
*  We're going to set up similar explosions, scale down to find out what size weapons North Korea is buying. [[02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9358.939999999999s)]
*  I said, that makes a lot of sense, actually. [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9368.859999999999s)]
*  Makes a lot more sense than that bunker buster bullshit. [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9370.7s)]
*  It's a problem. [[02:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9377.42s)]
*  We don't have a place to do it. [[02:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9378.94s)]
*  I said, I'll tell you what we'll do. [[02:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9379.980000000001s)]
*  I will let you go on any of the property I own, thousands of acres of permafrost. [[02:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9382.54s)]
*  You do your testing. [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9386.7s)]
*  And he goes, well, what do you want for that? [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9389.58s)]
*  I want a letter from a high up guy in the Air Force thanking me for my contributions [[02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9394.060000000001s)]
*  to the safety of America. [[02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9399.58s)]
*  There it is. [[02:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9403.18s)]
*  What does it say on the top, Jamie? [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9404.54s)]
*  The Department of the Air Force, Brigadier General John Mark Joe, how you say his name? [[02:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9407.66s)]
*  John Jwath. [[02:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9413.980000000001s)]
*  Jwath. [[02:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9415.18s)]
*  I want to personally thank you for your cooperation assistance during a recent Air Force funded [[02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9416.86s)]
*  research project conducted north of Fairbanks, Alaska. [[02:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9421.58s)]
*  The data from this field experiment conducted on your land will be critically important [[02:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9424.86s)]
*  to improving the United States capability to monitor nuclear weapons development around [[02:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9429.5s)]
*  the world. [[02:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9434.460000000001s)]
*  Without the unselfish cooperation of private citizens such as you, this experiment would [[02:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9435.58s)]
*  not have been possible. [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9440.7s)]
*  On behalf of the United States Air Force, I express our most sincere appreciation to you. [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9442.300000000001s)]
*  Your contribution to the national security of the United States of America cannot be [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9447.82s)]
*  overestimated. [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9452.94s)]
*  Wow. [[02:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9454.94s)]
*  Now there's the flint tool I was telling you about. [[02:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9456.7s)]
*  It's about three inches by two and a half inches with a little area where you can see [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9460.380000000001s)]
*  a thumb or a finger to hold on to it right there. [[02:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9465.02s)]
*  And that rock is not host in Alaska according to my geologist buddy. [[02:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9470.140000000001s)]
*  Did they believe that people had traveled through Alaska from Eastern Europe? [[02:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9474.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9479.26s)]
*  So they knew that people had done that in the past. [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9480.060000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9482.060000000001s)]
*  What if you find a dude? [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9482.7s)]

*  This is like a resin. [[02:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9503.82s)]
*  So you feel that it's not a real skull. [[02:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9505.42s)]
*  That's why they're all exactly the same. [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9507.18s)]

*  When the pipeline people came along he says we got oil on the north slope. [[02:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9741.5s)]
*  Build a road up there or I'll build a road up there. [[02:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9748.62s)]
*  If I build the road up there we're going to take the oil. [[02:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9751.82s)]
*  It's on state land. [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9754.54s)]
*  So they built the road and they drilled wells and they produced 12 percent of America's energy right now to this day. [[02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9756.78s)]

*  You could build one of those for not a whole lot of money just a big garden hose. [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCBJR32zzxQ&t=9779.900000000001s)]
