# Joe Rogan Experience #1519 - Mike Baker
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [August 04, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR-GXnXw2wU)
*  Hello, Mike Baker.
*  Hello, Joe Rogan.
*  Brought your laptop this time, huh?
*  Look at that laptop.
*  I got a pad of paper.
*  You're prepared.
*  I got a pen.
*  There's many issues.
*  There's many things.
*  Thank you for my COVID test.
*  Oh, yeah, we needed that.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, we're doing them every week now.
*  I don't even know how many times I've been tested, but it's good to know.
*  It's good to know.
*  It's odd that you can travel across the country and find that some places it takes you 10
*  days to get a response.
*  Sometimes it takes 20 minutes to get a response.
*  That part I don't understand.
*  Well, those super duper ones they have at the White House, they can get those in 20
*  minutes.
*  The ones we have here.
*  You can get the, well, the 10 minute one.
*  See the antibody blood test will show you in 10 minutes whether or not you have, and
*  this is the FDA approved ones that we use here.
*  They show you whether or not you have active antibodies, meaning a recent infection.
*  You're probably currently fighting off the virus or whether or not it's an old infection.
*  So you had the virus and beat it, and then the nose wobbles, say definitively, if you've
*  got it in your system.
*  Now, if they come back during the course of this show and say that I've got it, am I quarantined
*  in the studio?
*  Yeah, well, the antibody is already negative, so most likely you don't have it.
*  Oh, good.
*  Okay, I feel better.
*  Well, how do you turn this thing towards you?
*  Sorry.
*  No worries.
*  So how do you feel about all this?
*  You weirded out?
*  You haven't been here since COVID, right?
*  Yeah, we were, I think the last time it was before then, just before then.
*  It started to settle in.
*  And then I traveled last, it was mid-February, I was in New York City, and it was starting
*  to, people were starting to be aware, and they were talking about it a little bit, but
*  there were really no changes in behavior.
*  And then it really hit and everybody went into a hurry lockdown.
*  And the good thing is pandemics don't last, right?
*  So we're going to get past this.
*  This is not like the zombie apocalypse.
*  So I'm not one of those people that is hiding in my bunker, even though I like my bunker.
*  But kind of bunky you got.
*  I like a good bunker.
*  I bet you do.
*  But you have a real one, right?
*  I do.
*  I do.
*  When the kind of screws like a fucking submarine.
*  A little periscope that comes up, looks around the compound.
*  It looks like a gopher.
*  We use it for a variety of reasons.
*  But I'm worried because it's serious and of course it's tragic to lose anybody and we've
*  lost over 150,000 people, but you also got to keep this in context, right?
*  We've had pandemics before.
*  Pandemics just means it crossed international boundaries.
*  So there's an element here.
*  Two things can be true.
*  You can believe the science, which of course you should do.
*  You should pay attention to statistics and data and do the best things you can do.
*  But you can also look at it and go, we're kind of fucked because part of this problem
*  is the coverage of it because of political reasons.
*  Not to jump right into the political thing, but I can't help but think that we wouldn't
*  have quite as much confusion and we wouldn't have quite as much the angst that people are
*  feeling if it weren't for the visceral hatred that exists out there on some sectors for
*  the president.
*  And again, I don't have a dog in the hunt, but I have a feeling like the tone of coverage
*  will change in November if Biden wins.
*  And science doesn't change, right?
*  It's still the same fucking virus, but I just have a feeling that we'll see a tone change.
*  Suddenly, it'll be a little bit more about if Biden wins, it'll be more about, yeah,
*  let's look on the bright side.
*  Let's get this coverage sorted out.
*  Let's get the country working.
*  Let's do these things.
*  And again, you can believe both things.
*  You can believe that we're fucked because of the politics and you can also believe the
*  science.
*  My friend got tested, turned out positive, and the doctor asked him what his political
*  leanings are.
*  And he said, why?
*  And he said, well, I really believe in hydroxychloroquine, but a lot of people who are Democrats who
*  don't like the president don't want to use it.
*  I'm like, that is hilarious.
*  And he goes, hydroxychloroquine, when used correctly, he said, particularly in the early
*  stages of the virus, seems to be very effective.
*  Now, there's all these people that are coming out and saying it's not, and there's all these
*  people that are coming out.
*  And I talked to my doctor about it and I said, well, why do you think that it's because the
*  doctor that I use currently, he recommends it for people that are high risk as a prophylactic.
*  That's the way Trump is supposedly taking it.
*  He's like, it's actually there's a study that shows that it's very effective, a study from
*  Italy that shows it's very effective as a prophylactic.
*  And he says, also, when you get it, you catch the virus and then you get it quickly.
*  So if you can get hydroxychloroquine and you quickly.
*  But you know, look, I'm a moron.
*  I don't know who the fuck to believe.
*  So I read all this shit.
*  Well, do I believe the doctor?
*  Do I believe all these other doctors that say it's bullshit?
*  Do I believe that whole team of doctors?
*  By the way, Andrew Schultz has a fucking hilarious video on hydrochloroquine.
*  Like, what is it?
*  He did one of those Instagram videos.
*  So go check that out.
*  But it's one of those things where it's like, I wish the president didn't talk about it
*  because then we would know what the fuck it is.
*  Is it good?
*  Is it bad?
*  Is there people really not taking it just because the president is the one who endorsed
*  it?
*  Like, that is so crazy.
*  I don't think there's any doubt about that, right?
*  I mean, there's some.
*  So it's it.
*  Yeah.
*  And people don't know, like to your point, people don't know what to believe.
*  Right.
*  And it's it's one thing if if the reporting or the dissemination of information is partisan
*  during normal times.
*  But you're talking about a public health crisis.
*  And you would think we'd set all of that bullshit aside.
*  I mean, if we can't come together as a country during a fucking public health crisis, what
*  the hell is wrong?
*  But and it's both sides.
*  Both sides are tossing hand grenades at each other.
*  So it's not just one side or the other.
*  I'm going to send Jamie this right now, because this is from Newsweek.
*  This is why it's really confusing.
*  This is from Newsweek.
*  And this is from a professor of epidemiology from I believe from.
*  Yeah.
*  From Yale School of Public Health.
*  You know, and he says the key to the COVID-19 already exists.
*  We need to start using it.
*  And he's recommending hydroxychloroquine.
*  Pull up. Did you get there?
*  Yeah. Look at this.
*  Like, this is a fucking real problem.
*  This is a real doctor, a professor of epidemiology.
*  Like, what the fuck?
*  Yeah. I mean, and you see you see some folks coming out, some doctors coming out and saying,
*  well, it doesn't it doesn't work in patients.
*  And then it turns out you read further into the story and it doesn't work on patients
*  who are already seriously ill.
*  Yes. That's what they're saying.
*  Right. And so but you have to.
*  The problem is nobody makes it past the headlines for the most part.
*  And more and more people are getting their bullshit information from Facebook user groups.
*  And nobody reads down.
*  And to be fair, media outlets know that.
*  So they'll bury the contradictory information, you know, in the 20th paragraph or something,
*  because they know no one's going to venture down there.
*  Everybody looks at the headlines because, you know, see, that convinces me or supports my theory.
*  But, yeah, I look at this and we've been doing everything you can do.
*  We've been, you know, wearing masks.
*  You know, I don't see what the bullshit is about the masks.
*  Wear a fucking mask when you're out in public. Why?
*  Who cares? You get used to it.
*  Yeah. It's better bandanas are way better.
*  You can breathe out them better. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Plus, it just looks good. Yeah, you feel like a bandana.
*  Yeah. Get your horse waiting outside.
*  Just that late.
*  Do you know that whole video where there's a bunch of doctors that keeps getting removed from YouTube?
*  Oh, yeah. Facebook with a bunch of doctors talking about hydroxychloroquine and Z packs and zinc.
*  Everybody's like, you need to listen to this lady.
*  Then it turns out the lady believes that the cause of impotence is spirits.
*  And she thinks there's alien DNA in vaccines.
*  Is that what is that what she said?
*  Yeah, it's a little odd.
*  She's completely off the reservation.
*  Yeah. Oh, you're not supposed to say that, right?
*  I think you're not supposed to say off the reservation.
*  Oh, well.
*  It's offensive to Indians.
*  Damn it. Yeah.
*  OK, hold on. Let me make a note of that.
*  That one I didn't have on my list of what's offensive.
*  I was taught by a Native American lady.
*  OK. I'm not supposed to say that one.
*  Oh, she's off the chain. I think you could say that.
*  Off the hook? No.
*  But off the chain is good, right?
*  It's not crazy. Shit. I need a new crazy term.
*  What's a non offensive, crazy term?
*  It's not. Well, I shouldn't say not going to offend anybody
*  because there's no such thing anymore.
*  Oh, fucking nuts. How about that?
*  We just go with that. Yeah. Yeah.
*  She's a doctor.
*  She's a legit doctor, but apparently she is nuts.
*  Yeah. What do you got, Jamie?
*  What does she say? OK.
*  Summer reported that a 2000 a 2015 sermon
*  that laid out a supposed Illuminati plan hatched by a witch
*  to destroy the world using abortion, gay marriage and children's toys.
*  Among among other things, Emmanuel claimed that DNA
*  from space aliens is currently being used in medicine. OK.
*  She also offered prayers through her website
*  to remove generational curses transmitted through placenta.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Seems legit.
*  No, I see where she's coming from.
*  Yeah. Trump addressed the video. Hold on a second.
*  Saying I think they're very respected doctors.
*  There was a woman who was spectacular.
*  She was spectacular placenta.
*  I just I pay money to hear him say placenta.
*  But he said of hydroxychloroquine, I happen to think it works in early stages.
*  So that's the problem.
*  See, when he says that and then the lady who believes in witchcraft says that
*  then like maybe it does work.
*  But the problem is a fucking lady who believes in alien DNA and witchcraft
*  and generational curses transmitted through placenta.
*  I wonder what's children's toys.
*  I mean, I got kids now. I got to worry.
*  I mean, which ones would you assume?
*  I'm going to go with Mr. Potato Head. Yeah.
*  Yeah. I mean, most of my kids, basically now all we got around the house
*  and nerf guns, right?
*  And so like any time you walk.
*  Do you remember the pink panther where you walk around the house
*  and then Kato would like leap on him?
*  That's what it's like around my house.
*  Now you're going to get popped in the air hole by a nerf bullet at close range
*  because you never know when they're going to sneak up on you and use these things.
*  And so but that's about all we got anymore.
*  That and we do have some Legos.
*  So I hope she wasn't talking about Legos.
*  If she's talking about Legos, then we know she's really crazy.
*  Yeah. But I think to your point again, you know, part of this is
*  it would be nice if if
*  if the messaging from the White House was was better.
*  Let's face it on a number of things.
*  We wouldn't have quite the chaos that we do right now.
*  Well, he's basically using the same strategy used to be a famous person.
*  You know, you know, he says wacky shit.
*  He speaks off the cuff.
*  He doesn't care. He doesn't have a filter.
*  And you can't you just can't employ.
*  It seemed like you could do that and become president.
*  But you can't do that and be president.
*  Like people are not willing to like let you talk like that while you're the president.
*  You have to know exactly what the fuck you're saying.
*  What do you think is going to happen in November?
*  That's a good question.
*  I'm not listen.
*  I'm not buying these polls.
*  I'll tell you that.
*  I don't believe them because first of all, who the fuck is answering polls?
*  Who? I've always said that's right.
*  The dumbest people in the world are the ones who answer polls.
*  So out of the dumbest people in the world with nothing to do,
*  most of them are picking Biden or more of them are picking Biden.
*  But it says who says all of the media outlets that want Trump to lose.
*  How do we know? How do we know if they're being accurate?
*  I mean, look, I believe there is a large group of people
*  that are very uncomfortable with Donald Trump being the president.
*  I absolutely believe that.
*  I believe there is an also large group of people that are very uncomfortable
*  with a man who seems to be mentally compromised winning the election
*  and doing so by hiding.
*  I mean, the guy's never he was just at another thing the other day
*  and he forgot where he was. Did you see the video? Yeah. Yeah.
*  No, until he comes out with his VP pick.
*  Yeah. All bets are off as far as I'm concerned on Biden.
*  And VP is going to have a bucket of lube and she's going to dunk it in there
*  and stuff her hand up his ass and she's going to be working him
*  like we can at Bernie's.
*  There is no way that guy's going to be doing any talking.
*  Yeah, I don't know if you could do that.
*  I guess physically, you're going to have to. Yeah.
*  Kamala Harris is a strong woman.
*  I think she could do it.
*  Do you think she's the pick? She could win.
*  She could do it. Yeah.
*  She she would make sense to people because she's a powerful woman.
*  Like, you know, she's got to choose a former district attorney.
*  She's a she's a powerful person.
*  She's got, you know, she's got name recognition.
*  Yeah, got that. She's got a commanding presence. Yeah.
*  But, you know, I for what it's worth, I mean, a look, he's he's
*  he did something kind of wacky.
*  I understand why he did it because, you know, that's the world we live in.
*  But he's backed himself in the corner and said, OK, I'm
*  I'm going with gender and demographics rather than, you know, identifying
*  the most qualified person.
*  So, OK, fine. That's what it is.
*  Very strange thing to do, though.
*  Yeah, it is. But, you know, the Susan Rice, I will put out a
*  I would be much more comfortable with Susan Rice
*  than I would be with Harris, frankly, just given the work that she's done,
*  the things that she's done right on National Security Council.
*  She was UN ambassador.
*  She was assistant secretary of state.
*  She was what national security advisor for four years.
*  I wouldn't be surprised if he ends up picking her
*  because he worked with her very closely for eight years.
*  And she doesn't have the name recognition.
*  But I don't know that in this election cycle,
*  that's as important as it has been in the past.
*  Isn't there some controversy with her regarding Benghazi?
*  There is. But
*  and rightly so, right?
*  She went out that the whole story was she went out after.
*  How many years is that incredible going on eight years ago, September 11, 2012.
*  So shortly afterwards, she went on TV.
*  She did a series of interviews right afterwards.
*  Sort of the face of the administration talking about this.
*  And she utilized a bunch of talking points that had been prepared
*  by the Intel community, right?
*  Led at the time by John Brennan and some others.
*  And in that, that's where it famously blamed the video
*  that came out in the protests in Cairo and then the movie, that movie.
*  Yeah. Yeah. What exactly?
*  You see. OK, look, you used to work for the CIA.
*  Used to. I don't know if you still do.
*  Let's be honest. Well, but used to.
*  We're going to start. I don't know if you ever get out.
*  But that movie seemed like if there was any,
*  if there was ever some movie that was made to sort of be used as a coverup,
*  that movie did not look like a real movie.
*  That no. Well, it wasn't it wasn't really.
*  I mean, it wasn't that was it wasn't a James Cameron movie.
*  It wasn't that people what the fuck.
*  Yeah, like it was. It was made by an independent filmmaker.
*  And it was perceived as this very
*  anti Islamic. Yeah.
*  And and but the bottom line was, I mean, for for Susan Rice,
*  if you're just looking because you're at you've actually pinpointed the one
*  chink in her armor, right?
*  I can't say that anymore, can I?
*  You can still say chink in your arm. OK, OK.
*  You have to say it quick. Quick. OK.
*  You have to run right through it.
*  Chink one, two, three, four in your armor. OK.
*  So it's like you can say pussy cat.
*  You can say pussy.
*  You got to roll right through it. Yes. Yeah. OK. All right.
*  Yes. So that's the problem with her is the Benghazi issue.
*  So but look,
*  the bottom line is, if you don't believe that Joe Biden is likely
*  going to be the president for four years, if he gets elected, right,
*  for whatever reason, then the VP pick is incredibly important,
*  more so than we've had in a long time and more so than ever.
*  Yeah, more so than ever. Yeah.
*  And you want this to be a serious minded individual.
*  If you want to hang that, if you'd rather see him pick somebody like Karen Bass
*  or Tammy Duckworth or someone rather than
*  than someone who's had the range of experience
*  within government that Susan Rice has had, you know, again,
*  I'm not showing for Susan Rice. I'm just saying, look, you know,
*  you prefer I would prefer her because I respect the those
*  those areas that she's worked in.
*  I'm more focused on our position overseas.
*  I'm more focused on the foreign policy and that sort of thing.
*  And I realize that she's taking this hit for Benghazi.
*  Of course she is. Right. Rightly so.
*  But, you know, this is a game of compromise.
*  Could you explain why she took the hit, though?
*  So we kind of glossed over it. But there was a movie. Right.
*  This movie was erroneously
*  blamed for being the cause of the attack.
*  It wasn't the real cause. It was not.
*  What was the real cause of the attack?
*  Well, the real cause of the attack was we, you know, we we ignored,
*  you know, signs of increasing activity in in Benghazi
*  at the consulate that we had there.
*  We ignored at the time
*  advice, you know, and suggestions that we beef up our security out there.
*  And we allowed for a
*  we didn't allow for, but we were not prepared for the attack
*  that took place on September 11th in 2012.
*  And immediately afterwards, the line from the administration was,
*  shit, nobody could have seen this coming. Right.
*  Because, you know, there was a spontaneous protest
*  because of this anti-Islamic movie.
*  It was a hateful video.
*  That's how they referred to it in their talking points.
*  A hateful video.
*  And then it spread from Cairo.
*  It spread all of a sudden.
*  Boom, it popped up in Benghazi.
*  And we had this table.
*  And now, you know, then they tried to back it up a little bit by going, well, yes,
*  some some some jihadist elements, you know, hijacked that, you know,
*  legitimate protest over a hateful video in Benghazi.
*  And who could have seen that coming?
*  Bottom line was they should have seen it coming.
*  So, yes, you should take some some flack for that.
*  But I guess my point is we got to compromise at some point if, you know,
*  and I again, it's not like I'm I'm still amazed at.
*  OK, 2016, we had a choice between Clinton and Trump.
*  2020, we got a choice between Biden and Trump.
*  What the fuck's happened to our country?
*  330 plus million people.
*  And this is what we got. Right.
*  But I'm just saying you've got you.
*  So you're going to have to set aside some of your concerns
*  and figure out who is going to be best suited.
*  Why didn't they just have Susan Rice run as president?
*  Because like she had she would have a legitimate chance.
*  Well, not again, not without the name recognition. Right.
*  And there's still a lot.
*  There's still a lot of game that gets played, a lot of theater and politics.
*  You know, so, oh, my God, have they ever run for president before?
*  And so that's what Harris has going for.
*  And I'm not saying she's not capable.
*  She's certainly capable.
*  But again, look, here's the thing.
*  I'm I'm more comfortable with with Republican policies
*  related to foreign policy, related to security, national security concerns
*  related to the economy to some degree.
*  When Republicans aren't fiscally conservative anymore.
*  You know, I'm small government, but I'm more aligned with that.
*  The fact that I don't like
*  the character or the behavior of of Trump.
*  Right. I mean, that I disagree with the fact that he's, you know,
*  he gets out there, he doesn't have an edit button.
*  Doesn't mean I don't appreciate the things that the administration does
*  in certain areas like our China policy or other things.
*  So I think the Democrats make a mistake thinking, OK,
*  people don't like Trump, so they're going to vote for this this thing over here.
*  Right. And if this thing is a hybrid between Joe Biden,
*  Bernie Sanders, who, you know, got shafted once again in this,
*  you know, this round of Democratic primaries.
*  And if they if they tilt hard left,
*  it doesn't mean just because you don't like Trump as an individual
*  that suddenly you're OK with hard left policies.
*  But I think the Democrats make that mistake.
*  They think they're they think that that's the solution to Trump.
*  Go as far away from him as possible.
*  Yeah. And then you can't find a center.
*  I think exactly. That's the solution.
*  I think the solution is somewhere in the center.
*  And when when you see shit like what's happening in Portland and Seattle,
*  I think people are more aware than ever now that civil unrest is like
*  it's it's very strange.
*  It's very strange to watch them try to break into that.
*  What was the building in Portland they were trying to the Hatfield Courthouse,
*  the federal courthouse?
*  That was insane. Yeah.
*  Watching that was insane. I don't understand the motivation.
*  Like connecting that to how do you connect that in Portland,
*  the most liberal city in the country?
*  How do you how do you arguably, right?
*  Probably the most liberal. Yeah.
*  The most progressive. Yeah. Portland. Right there.
*  How do you connect that to Black Lives Matter?
*  I mean, how do you connect that to George Floyd's death?
*  How do you connect that to? Why?
*  Why? Why? I just don't understand.
*  Why would you try to break into the courthouse?
*  They're trying to recreate what went wrong, what didn't work in Seattle.
*  Right. That whole zone.
*  Chess or chopper. Yeah. Yeah. That didn't work.
*  I mean, that was nonsense. It was crazy.
*  You made a worse version of American six blocks.
*  It's like one of those little tiny little, you know,
*  like if you took a glass dome and you put like little animals in there
*  and you let them eat each other alive.
*  I was like, we're going to we're going to create utopian glass.
*  Like, yeah, they made a worse version of the United States.
*  They put up borders immediately.
*  They stop people from coming in. They had armed guards.
*  They wind up using police.
*  They didn't have cops, but they have people that act like cops
*  and beat the fuck out of people for filming. Right.
*  The whole thing is madness. They had murders.
*  It was it was well, it's it's quick.
*  It's I mean, look, Portland, I I know Portland extremely well.
*  My parents, you know, lived in Portland for a couple of decades.
*  Beautiful place.
*  It used to be a really hell of a place.
*  But over the years and and, you know, I know Republicans
*  and Democrats who feel the same way who are in Portland and the surrounding area.
*  And they all feel like this place is slowly, you know,
*  circling down a toilet because of local and state management. Right.
*  And so what happened in Portland?
*  Not really a surprise. You know, it's a same
*  that the people that that that that do this sort of activity, right?
*  That, you know, have been referred to as Antifa or anarchists or whatever.
*  The same sort of trust of fairy and, you know,
*  bottom feeding folks in really any city in the world who engage in a WTO protest
*  because it's cool to get out there and protest.
*  I don't understand the mentality, but if you try to figure out a motivation for them,
*  you know, you'll lose your mind because they really don't have one.
*  You could take 10 of those people out of Portland
*  who are engaged in sort of the violent activity and ask them,
*  well, why are you doing this?
*  And you'll get 10 different answers.
*  They really don't have it's not like that.
*  And they've the sad part about it is they they hijacked very legitimate protests.
*  Yes. Over, you know, really serious,
*  important questions about how do we how do we improve policing around the country?
*  How do we get to that point?
*  And I tell you, the most disappointing part about it is
*  after after the tragedy with George Floyd,
*  if the focus had been on, OK, here's what we have to do.
*  We have to.
*  Seriously, not just lip service, we have to improve the policing
*  to solve this particular issue. How do we do that?
*  Well, there's certain logistical things you can do.
*  You can improve your vetting and hiring of police candidates, right?
*  Of applicants for the job.
*  You can do that.
*  That's a that's a protocol you can put in place.
*  You can improve the training that costs money.
*  So defunding the police is kind of fucked.
*  You can you can improve the training and make it continuous.
*  It's not just a one time thing.
*  It's a continuous training on how to respond to situations.
*  It's like it's like weapons training.
*  If you don't keep doing it, if you're not always practicing,
*  it just doesn't work. Right.
*  And then what can you do?
*  You can also improve disciplinary action.
*  Those are those are concrete things that you can do.
*  They're not easy. Right.
*  But it's it's not as heavy a lift as deciding in the aftermath
*  of the George Floyd tragedy.
*  What we're really going to do is we're going to remove racism
*  from the hearts and minds of people.
*  This is not going to happen. Right.
*  I'd like to think it would in theory. Hey, great.
*  Get rid of racism. But
*  you know what you should what this should have been
*  was a protest about doing things that actually will impact meaningfully
*  people's lives.
*  And it and it and it veered off because people wanted to feel self-righteous
*  and veered off into what you have to prove how pure you are.
*  You have to remove racism. Right.
*  Now, I know I know black people that object to white people.
*  I know white people that object to people not of their race.
*  I know Hispanics that don't like people of of non-Hispanics.
*  Racism exists. Sad to say. Right.
*  And all mankind, it's a human element of nature.
*  Would you rather spin your wheels and act self-righteous and try to say,
*  well, we're going to have this exercise where we remove racism from from mankind.
*  Would you rather say in the aftermath of this, let's do the things
*  that can actually make a difference.
*  And that's what we didn't do.
*  And then legitimate protests over over the anger and frustration about all this
*  got further hijacked by, again, antifa, anarchists, whatever you want to call it.
*  I think that's a big part of the problem.
*  You know, Ben Shapiro and I had this conversation about the protests
*  in this this term where they are large, mostly peaceful protests.
*  And he had a hilarious point.
*  He said, OJ Simpson had a mostly peaceful night the night he killed his wife.
*  It was only three minutes of the entire day that wasn't peaceful.
*  Like that is a fucking great point.
*  Yeah. But but it is true in the protest that most of those people
*  want the world to be a better place. Right.
*  The problem is the people that hijacked that
*  and are trying to light the federal buildings on fire and smash monuments.
*  You know, particularly my mean like they're going after Abraham Lincoln.
*  I mean, Jesus Christ. Right.
*  He's the guy that freed the fucking slaves.
*  Like, what are we doing? Are we going to erase history?
*  Yeah. I would have loved if Abraham Lincoln could have had a time machine
*  and gone to 2020 and understood what we know now about systemic racism.
*  However, he lived in the seventeen hundreds when he wrote with a fucking feather.
*  OK, give the guy a break.
*  The world was a weird place back then.
*  Well, and that's and that's part of it is trying to
*  trying to judge people of the past by current morals,
*  a current understanding, current thinking is is is pretty absurd.
*  Right. It doesn't justify past bad actions.
*  But you know what?
*  This idea that you're going to erase history or remove history
*  or not learn from it going forward is it discredits
*  the ability of people to have rational thought, right?
*  To understand and look at a context, look at something in context and say,
*  OK, nowadays, that's unacceptable.
*  But OK, I get, you know, why these things occurred.
*  It's tragic or it's regrettable, whatever.
*  But I mean, look, in the UK, they were, you know,
*  they were attacking the statue of Churchill. Yeah.
*  I mean, holy fuck. Crazy. Yeah.
*  I mean, I think I said, did I just say Lincoln seventeen hundreds?
*  I meant eighteen hundred. Well, it was eighteen sixty five. Right.
*  But either way, the idea that this guy is supposed to be a perfect person back
*  then. Look, history is supposed to be about the things that happen,
*  the people that made a difference and how we got to where we are today.
*  And Lincoln is a big part.
*  The eighteen sixty five, the Emancipation Proclamation,
*  that's a big part of how we are, who we are today.
*  It's look, it's horrible that the early settlers brought over slaves from Africa.
*  It's horrible that slaves still exist today.
*  All these things are horrible.
*  They're horrible. But taking down statues of people that made a difference and made
*  change. Look, if you want to take if you want to take down statues of
*  Confederate generals and stuff like that, there's a good argument there.
*  It's a good argument that maybe we shouldn't have those or maybe we should have them
*  somewhere. You know, like the like the same place you have a statue of Genghis Khan.
*  Right. Maybe they shouldn't be. You know what I'm saying?
*  Is there a statue of Genghis Khan? Sure there is.
*  Yeah. Somewhere somewhere in Mongolia. There's got to be. Right.
*  Look, Genghis Khan killed 10 percent of the fucking population while he was alive.
*  But it doesn't mean there shouldn't be some recognition of this historical figure
*  when you're talking about 2020.
*  Well, I think interestingly, and this doesn't again, you know, you can you can.
*  The problem is nowadays, right?
*  You've got you've got sort of the righteous mob on the left and the righteous mob on
*  the right. And the problem people make is is they try to placate one side of the
*  other thinking somehow they're always going to they're going to be pure enough.
*  You're never pure enough for the self-righteous mob, no matter where they are
*  on the spectrum. Right. They're always finding new.
*  There's a new benchmark.
*  There's always that opportunity.
*  But, you know, a lot of the Confederate statues out there were put up in an effort to
*  and this sounds weird, but in an effort to try to unify the country again.
*  Right. And in the aftermath of the Civil War.
*  And there was this element of saying, let's try to.
*  And so you think, OK, that's a lot of them were put up actually during the civil rights.
*  Right. They're put up when they were thinking that people were getting too high
* falutin. You wanted to celebrate.
*  And that's absolutely true.
*  Yeah. Those are the really cheap ones, too.
*  Yeah. True. They're really shittily made because they made them real quick.
*  But I mean, so the point being is, I agree.
*  Yeah. If you want to take those down.
*  Well, sure. Yeah. I mean, why would you have a statue of some Confederate leader?
*  Fine. Take it out. Take it off the streets.
*  That makes I get I get that.
*  Right. And if that helps people feel
*  terrific, put it in a museum or whatever, you're going to do with it.
*  But George Washington, George Washington.
*  Yeah, I know exactly. Abraham Lincoln.
*  It's funny when they were taken down Confederate statues.
*  Trump once said, what's next?
*  You're going to take down George Washington.
*  And everyone was laughing like they're not going to do that.
*  But yet they are going to do that now.
*  Yeah. Yeah. And you know what?
*  And two things, again, as always, can be true at the same time.
*  Somebody could be, you know,
*  doing some things you disagree with vehemently.
*  They could have also done something that helped move the country forward.
*  Did something that had extreme positive.
*  Well, that's the Genghis Khan argument.
*  You know, he opened up trade with China in the process of killing 10 million people.
*  He opened up trade with the East.
*  Was he a free trader? I didn't know that.
*  Free trade guy. Free trade.
*  Yeah. Raper was your first NAFTA murderer.
*  Yeah. He killed so many people, they changed the carbon footprint of the earth.
*  Yeah. Like the New York Times had this crazy article about it.
*  He literally killed 10 percent of the people on earth.
*  But he was an angry man.
*  Look, it's awful that we have history that's filled with terrible acts and deeds.
*  But I don't think that removing statues of people who tried to make a difference,
*  you know, within the context of their their time, you know, with Lincoln 1865,
*  with George Washington, 1700s.
*  I mean, this is you're talking about people that when they were doing this,
*  they were the best example of humanity that you could find.
*  They were the best example of what we had.
*  I mean, when George Washington was the first president of the United States,
*  I mean, you want to talk about a fucking radical undertaking,
*  this crazy experiment and self-government
*  while they escaped from the grasp of Europe.
*  I mean, it's really nuts.
*  Yeah. And again, I think there's there's an element here that
*  we missed the we missed the boat maybe again, right?
*  We've gone through these.
*  It's not like we haven't had protests before, you know, Black Lives Matter
*  protests and over the same issues of police brutality and all that.
*  But it all falls into that same bucket.
*  From my perspective, that we we don't do the hard things, right?
*  The hard things would have been to say
*  from a local, state and federal position,
*  let's enact these different protocols that can improve policing.
*  Let's do those things that we need to do.
*  That's a heavy lift in a way.
*  The easier things are let's tear down a statue, right?
*  Or, you know, find a way to make us feel better about ourselves
*  without necessarily having to.
*  And it's like this this shell game, I think, that the politicians sometimes play.
*  Right. And you see it, you saw it in Portland where, you know,
*  OK, let's just placate this for a while.
*  It'll make everybody feel better and then they'll the protests will die down.
*  Well, Seattle is the best example, right?
*  When the mayor came out and said, she called it maybe it's the summer of love.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 67.
*  The summer of love.
*  Have they totally squashed that now?
*  Is that that whole place brought back to the original business owners?
*  I don't know is the answer to that question.
*  I do know that they've they've been looking at how do we do
*  community based policing?
*  How do we defund the police and yet still have something that resembles
*  a response to the citizens need for security?
*  I don't know what any of all that dribble means.
*  If you want to if you want to improve the policing,
*  it's an investment, right?
*  It's not defunding.
*  But again, defunding and saying that and saying that's what I'm for.
*  It's a easy fucking way. Right.
*  To feel good and to placate people.
*  And then you don't do shit.
*  And then five years from now, we have another incident
*  because you didn't actually do the things that make policing better.
*  Well, you get where you got in New York City.
*  It began. It gets even worse for the citizens
*  because now the police don't have any faith at all in the government.
*  They're not respected. They're not appreciated.
*  And you've seen this giant uptick in crime because their presence isn't there anymore.
*  Yeah. I mean, it's really crazy, man.
*  It's like a movie.
*  I've never thought if you went back to March when we shut down,
*  I never thought I would be sitting here with you at the end of early August here.
*  And we would be talking about this.
*  I would have never thought that this would have taken place,
*  that we would have legitimate civil unrest in this country.
*  People getting shot in the streets and protests.
*  You know, I know that there's a real concern
*  a lot of these cities that they're going to someone's going to try to recreate
*  what happened in Seattle, recreate what happened in Portland.
*  And they're worried about it.
*  The thing about it is it seems so organized.
*  It really does. It doesn't seem that haphazard.
*  It seems organized.
*  How does how does how do these things get started?
*  Like, how do you get something as big as these Portland riots?
*  Well, you know, it's a it's a really good question.
*  And sometimes what you see is a what appears to be a grassroots
*  movement or grassroots activity happening, just kind of swelling up
*  from from a couple of neighborhoods.
*  Yes, there was an element of that.
*  But you also see like if you're talking about,
*  you know, talking about activist environmental groups, as an example,
*  you'll also see some commonality between some of these groups.
*  You'll see commonality in in communications advice, in financing
*  and in legal assistance and support from national groups.
*  Right. And yet it's in there.
*  It's in their agenda.
*  It's to their advantage to make it appear as if it's a grassroots movement.
*  So that all stays in the background.
*  I'd argue that, you know, yes, some of this
*  and again, not to disappear down some rabbit hole where it's a George
*  Soros funded thing. That's where I was going.
*  Yeah. But I mean, you know, is there are there some elements that help
*  with communication support or transportation assistance
*  or legal advice or whatever it may be?
*  Absolutely. You know, these things that they they very rarely
*  is there an actual, genuine organic
*  grassroots movement that has no outside organizational support?
*  That's this spontaneous. That's big. Yeah.
*  So but again, I, you know,
*  look, we're putting our tin foil hats on.
*  But if anybody can put that on, you can put them on.
*  I left mine out in the car, but I'll go get it.
*  You've been on the inside, you know, working for the CIA.
*  You know how it works.
*  Well, we very rarely organized things like that.
*  That's not what I'm saying.
*  I'm not saying that, you know, yeah, you guys did it.
*  I'm saying you understand how these people operate. Right. Right.
*  Yeah. The way that someone like me doesn't.
*  And also, you know, again, look, I, you know, we've talked about this
*  in the past, and I'm not I'm not necessarily a conspiracy theorist,
*  but sometimes, yeah, sometimes, you know, you got to follow the threads
*  that you can pull on.
*  And sometimes it takes you down an interesting path.
*  And you think, OK, maybe there is something to this.
*  I wouldn't say you're a conspiracy theorist, but I would say you're open
*  to the possibility of conspiracy.
*  Like when you and I talked about the Martin Luther King assassination. Yeah.
*  And you you took a big pause and you said that one does not make sense.
*  Yeah. No, I agree.
*  I still feel that way. Yeah. Yeah.
*  One is filled with holes. Yeah.
*  And I agree as well.
*  I looked into it much more after you and I talked.
*  And it's yeah, that's very strange.
*  And the way that you sometimes can get actually further into it
*  without kind of disappearing down some of these,
*  you know, peripheral side stories and issues is is money.
*  Look for look for funding.
*  Look for issues of of where did money go?
*  Because that sometimes will take you down a more
*  legitimate path. Right.
*  And a lot of times investigations get built on very shaky ground
*  because you start with a theory or whatever, and you're never starting on firm ground.
*  Sometimes when you follow the money, it it it keeps you a little more grounded.
*  Right. Yeah.
*  Follow the money. Follow the fat.
*  Well, that's the thing with this.
*  It's like, where is the money coming from?
*  Like, where where is the money coming from that organizes and
*  and and helps these people get out of jail and and all that jazz?
*  Well, and there's certain things that.
*  Let's go back to Portland for a minute.
*  OK. One of the problems is, I think.
*  The media journalism in general,
*  you know, isn't anywhere near as curious or
*  concerned with investigation as it used to be. Right.
*  It's it's it's easier now to just say this is where I'm at.
*  I'm subjective. Of course, I'm subjective.
*  You know, and so here I go. Here's my here's my there's the idea of objectivity.
*  And journalism is pretty much out the window.
*  With Portland early on, for instance, they they published
*  a mug shots and names of
*  I think there were maybe a dozen of the individuals
*  who arrested for violent activity and violent activity.
*  Now, a curious journalist, you would have thought,
*  would have said, let's do some research.
*  Let's look at all these people and let's look at their backgrounds.
*  You know, it's already public information.
*  They've already posted it.
*  Let's dig into this and find out who are these people.
*  Are there any linkages or any commonalities between all these individuals?
*  Can we find something that's interesting there?
*  Maybe we won't. But let's do some investigation.
*  Right. You know, you'd like to think that's what journalism used to be.
*  And maybe, you know, it doesn't seem like it is anymore.
*  But that doesn't happen.
*  I think there's a problem.
*  And here's one of the problems.
*  Most journalists are left wing.
*  There's a giant number.
*  I don't know what the percentage of is.
*  But if you want to go with whether it's Newsweek or CNN
*  or the New York Times or Washington Post or many, many, many, many
*  of these papers and organizations lean left, there's a dirty secret.
*  The dirty secret is Antifa acts as the thug enforcers of the left.
*  The people that do things like this, whether you approve of violence
*  or disapprove of violence, what they're doing is they they act
*  as the people doing the dirty work that many people on the left
*  think has to be done in order to enact real change.
*  Now, if you had the same thing in the right, imagine
*  my friend Tim Dillon said this.
*  Imagine if the Proud Boys were lighting Portland on fire.
*  Can you imagine if we had a Democratic president and the Proud Boys
*  were trying to break into the courthouse and light Portland on fire?
*  People would go fucking crazy.
*  It would be terrifying if it was a different political ideology,
*  but the same exact actions.
*  So because these actions are done with the correct political ideology,
*  under the guise of racial justice, under the guise of reforming our government.
*  So then everybody's OK with people literally burning books.
*  They're throwing books on a pile.
*  I mean, yeah, that's a Bible.
*  So go ahead. You could it's fucking crazy.
*  They're burning Bibles.
*  What does the Bible have to do with it?
*  The Bible gives a lot of people comfort, whether you believe in it or not.
*  You're throwing stacks of Bibles and then you're lighting them on fire
*  in front of a courthouse.
*  What if they've been throwing the Quran? Right.
*  Good. Very good example.
*  Very good. Yeah.
*  We'd all be losing our minds.
*  But Pelosi, you know, Nancy Pelosi came out and said,
*  well, people are going to do what they're going to do.
*  Really, Nancy? Really?
*  Well, she's she's an odd duck.
*  That lady, she's decided to call it Trump's virus now.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  She's obviously fucking with them, which part of it, I appreciate.
*  It's kind of it's kind of adorable.
*  Well, she's a joke came out when when when Herman Cain passed away
*  and he came out and said, well, it's very sad he passed away from the
*  the China virus.
*  You know, he just keeps doing it because he knows he does this.
*  And he and he knows he can hijack a news cycle.
*  Right. And he came out with this idea of, you know, the election
*  and possibly a delay because, you know, the post office,
*  he knows what he's doing and everybody rises to the bait.
*  Right. Yeah. He knows there's no way in hell they're going to delay the election.
*  Not going to happen.
*  Now, ideally, he wouldn't have thrown that out there just to, you know,
*  get a rise and just to steal the election, you know, or the news cycle.
*  But he does it.
*  Why do you think he said that?
*  Well, I think he was trying to.
*  A, I think because what do I know?
*  But it almost seems like he just enjoys right.
*  Fucking with people. Yeah.
*  And I think he knows what he's going to get, which is, again, what he got,
*  which is a couple of days of, oh, my God, hand wringing.
*  And I told you he's a dictator.
*  And of course, he's going to.
*  And and and then my favorite narrative of the left is, well, he's not going to leave.
*  If he loses in November, he's not going to leave.
*  That's my absolute favorite narrative from the left so far.
*  Yeah, I keep hearing that.
*  But I've seen no evidence that that's true.
*  Well, if you repeat something often enough, then it gets to be true.
*  It was like when we had the the chemical weapons issue in Iraq.
*  Remember, we had one source.
*  And then but if you if you report that, it gets into reporting channels
*  and then somebody else mentions it or refers to it.
*  And then you got to mentions that night.
*  And pretty soon people forget it only came from one source of information.
*  Elon Musk, please hurry up with your neural links
*  so we could read each other's minds and people can't lie anymore.
*  It's so important. Wouldn't that be nice?
*  It's so important. He's on the he's ready to go, man.
*  I'm telling you, we are two or three years away from being able to read each other's mind.
*  I say what that would be brilliant, because I used to I used to say that at the agency.
*  We used to get boxed fairly regularly or polygraph very regularly.
*  And I hated the polygraph.
*  And I my polygraph was huge because I'm one of those I'm a kind of a
*  I don't want to say I'm a Puritan, but I'm one of those Quaker people
*  who feels guilty about everything. Right.
*  I feel like if I took a pencil when I was a three year old, you know, my God,
*  I'm going to I got to confess it. Right.
*  So I I had a hell of a time during polygraphs. Right.
*  And then and then I get irritated with the examiners. Right.
*  One time I had one of the examiner say, you seem to know a lot of foreign people.
*  And I lost my mind. Right.
*  So I think, you know, and so I literally went after and said, you know what job I do?
*  You know what? What my my my fucking job is.
*  And I just snap. Right. And and protect fucks like you.
*  Yeah. So they're like, what do you mean?
*  I seem to know a lot of foreign people.
*  And so but I used to say all the time, I said, man, if they could just like
*  make a colander that would come down on your head, you read your thoughts.
*  I would be happier than a pig and shit because then I could have been out of this
*  thing in five minutes.
*  Look, I'm happy to admit my faults.
*  I'll tell you. I'll tell you exactly what's on my mind.
*  It's not all pretty.
*  But I'll let you in.
*  I'm a good person, but I have dark thoughts sometimes.
*  Go ahead. Take a look.
*  But I'll do that if you'll do that.
*  I don't want any lies.
*  The lies are the problem, the distortions of the truth.
*  Did you imagine the implosion of media if we had mind reading
*  and we find out exactly what's going on in The New York Times,
*  exactly what's going on in The Washington Post, exactly what's going on?
*  Whenever you see questionable stories, you're like, what the fuck is this?
*  Is this true? Is this bullshit?
*  Is this is this propaganda?
*  Who's telling them to write this?
*  Why are they writing like this?
*  What is what's the narrative behind this?
*  Well, they get away with it because they got an incurious public, right?
*  I would argue in part, right?
*  I think they're overwhelmed.
*  Well, yeah, you know, overwhelmed by information.
*  I don't know if it's a curious thing. It's a matter.
*  I think that's one of the things we're dealing with now with all this activity.
*  People have more free time.
*  They don't have obligations because they can't work.
*  Yeah, because so many folks are fucked and they're out of work.
*  That makes people more apt to be activist, more active,
*  more apt to get out there in the streets more.
*  And it creates actually more chaos because you're
*  you're having more people involved in these things
*  and they really don't have anything else to do with their time.
*  And when you're out there, you're screaming and you're fucking holding arms.
*  And you're saying, you know, we will overcome.
*  You really think like you are doing something.
*  I mean, it really does. I'm sure it feels good.
*  No, a lot of this is about, you know, feeling like, I mean,
*  you're you're making a difference, right?
*  Even if you even if you aren't.
*  I don't know whether we've talked about this before, but I think one of the
*  you're absolutely right.
*  There's the overwhelm with information because we have so many more outlets.
*  There's so many outlets for gathering information.
*  And most people are reading social media all day, all day, but very little else.
*  That's real. What drives me crazy is, I mean, you just do it.
*  You can you can spend five minutes doing it, right?
*  Just go when you're walking around.
*  Maybe not now because everybody's hiding in their hidey hole.
*  But, you know, just just the constant with the phone.
*  If people have five seconds of free time on their hands, they don't know what to do.
*  So they get their phones.
*  They said, OK, well, you know, if nothing else, at least I look like everybody else
*  staring at my phone.
*  But I think one of the interesting things is with with news dissemination is
*  you go back to, you know, the 50s, the 60s, 70s.
*  We had a shared moment, right?
*  Every day, for the most part, right?
*  Everybody would sit down at whatever five o'clock or 11 o'clock across the country
*  and you'd watch the news on one of three, basically three outlets, ABC, NBC or CBS.
*  And so for that moment, if you think about it,
*  the vast majority of people who were paying attention to this
*  were getting their their news delivered from the same one of three sources.
*  There was a there was a commonality there.
*  And they would, you know, process it differently
*  based on their own experiences and beliefs.
*  But at least there was that point of commonality.
*  And that disappeared.
*  That doesn't happen anymore.
*  And and I don't you know, I don't know where I'm going with that.
*  I just banging on about it. But I find it interesting.
*  There's no objective news source anymore.
*  That's a problem as well.
*  There's a left news source and a right news source.
*  There's no straight up Walter Cronkite person that's given us the facts.
*  Well, Walter had his had his had his own, you know, beliefs, too.
*  Well, no, no, no. But it's as close as you're going to get to a good example.
*  Right. You just didn't know it.
*  It wasn't in your face.
*  I would like to see someone today that tells you the real facts.
*  You know, well, I've said this before, is if it's a cash heavy business,
*  if you had to if you had the capital to set up a
*  an outlet that simply told you what the fuck happened that day.
*  Right. And here's your news.
*  I'm not going to I'm not going to have any opinion hours.
*  I'm not going to have any any commentary.
*  We're not going to have a panel discuss it and tell us what it might mean.
*  We're just going to we're going to take the top events of the day
*  and maybe two or three times a day.
*  Here's your news. Right.
*  We're going to take the time to research.
*  And that was the other thing about having a newscast at five
*  and a newscast at eleven.
*  You had all day long as an as a media business to check your facts,
*  to get it right. Right.
*  And you weren't playing beat the clock with with every mook with a with a smartphone.
*  Right. Who now thinks they're a blogger or a vlogger or whatever.
*  So, yeah.
*  But I think that would be I think I actually be very successful,
*  because I think people do want.
*  They want the the ability to the comfort of thinking,
*  yeah, maybe this is legitimate.
*  Maybe they want they want someone who's pure that way.
*  I think the only people that are doing it like that are independents.
*  There is a few of them out there.
*  There's a few of them that are just telling they're calling it like they see it.
*  If you want political information, my sources are Kyle Kalinsky,
*  Jimmy Dore and the Hill.
*  Those are the ones that I go to, because they'll call out people on both sides
*  and they say they show the problems.
*  The Hill's a particularly good show because you have one crystal
*  who's on the left and Sager who's on the right.
*  And they're honest and they're intelligent and they talk about things.
*  They disagree. But they're they're also friends.
*  And they've been on the podcast together.
*  But they'll tell you, here's the issues.
*  And this is this is why this is wrong.
*  And this is why this is corrupt.
*  And here's the influences.
*  And this is this is where, you know, you're being misled.
*  And but you could deliver you could deliver the news.
*  Think about it. Even even on the political side, even reporting on Capitol Hill,
*  you can deliver the news.
*  You can say, you know, during the course of today, this is what happened.
*  Yes. Right. Now, it's not going to blow anybody's skirt up
*  because it's not exciting and it's not titillating and it's not, you know,
*  it doesn't fire you up to hate the other side.
*  But you could do it.
*  It's just, you know, again, it's it's a talk about setting up,
*  you know, field offices and that's that's that's an expensive business.
*  And to do it and to be completely unbiased.
*  Yeah. You're going to have a lot of people working for you.
*  Good luck keeping them all unbiased, especially today.
*  If you're getting some kid fresh out of college and he's 22 or she's, you know,
*  you know, getting her graduate degree,
*  you're going to get kids that have gone through this system
*  that we're trying to trying to rectify.
*  The university system today is filled with woke politics.
*  Yeah, they're indoctrinating kids.
*  And a lot of these kids that are getting out, they have this idea
*  in their head before their frontal lobe is even fully formed
*  of what is good and what is bad and what is right, what is wrong
*  and what you're supposed to do.
*  You know, a lot of it is like it's it's it's really distorted and weird.
*  Well, my daughter, who my daughter who works in Washington, D.C. now
*  is getting a really good look at how government works.
*  When she was in college and she's, you know, she's more Republican
*  than most, you know, of her friends that were in college, you know,
*  because you're to your point, very liberal.
*  She used to talk about that.
*  She said she rarely had a debate.
*  She really had a moment where she would speak up in class
*  and take the opposite point because there's no upside to it.
*  Yeah, I want to get good grades.
*  Yeah. People think they're racist.
*  Yeah. And the professor will hate you. Right.
*  And that was it. And that was a big part of it.
*  She said, look, I my goal here was to get good grades.
*  And it was clear that, you know, taking the opposite position
*  from the professor or the the the the teaching assistant
*  wasn't going to get me where I wanted to be.
*  You're fucked. Yeah. And you and people adapt to.
*  That's the other thing about human beings.
*  When you're confronted by a large majority of people that think one way,
*  you will change and amend your thinking to fit in.
*  We don't like to be on the outside.
*  We don't like to be, you know, there's a few very strong minded rebels
*  out there in the world, but most people are conformists.
*  Most people just they think they're rebellious, but they're rebellious
*  along with a group of other people that think almost the exact same way.
*  And those are the people they hang out with. Right.
*  I got on the got on the tube one time when I was living in London
*  a few years back. And and it was during there was a there was a
*  it wasn't the mullet craze. It was the goatee craze.
*  Right. There was every dude was wearing a goatee.
*  So I came back from I was I forget where I was working overseas.
*  But while I was I was out there before I went back to London,
*  I fuck it. I'll go go to that seems to be the thing to do.
*  So I grow goatee. Right.
*  I get back to London and it literally was like the next day I was back there.
*  I get on the tube and I walk into the car.
*  I'm standing there and I look down the car
*  and every dude in that car had a goatee.
*  And I thought, holy fuck.
*  So I went home and shaved.
*  But I guess my point is is that you're right.
*  You want it. You want it.
*  You want to be I'm a rebel, but I'm only going to be a rebel
*  with a bunch of other people who, you know, you're typically unique.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly.
*  So it's a but it's part of being a human being, you know,
*  and I think we need to recognize that we need to understand that this plays
*  a large part in your belief system.
*  It's not necessarily that you're right or that you're wrong.
*  And be very, very wary of people who say they are right.
*  I am right because we're right.
*  We know because we're right and they're wrong.
*  Well, it's a cancel culture.
*  It's a cancel culture, too, is a big part of this.
*  It's part of being a fool.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  There's certain things you could be right about.
*  You could be right about mathematics.
*  You could be right about chemicals and you could be right about science.
*  You can be right about things.
*  But when it comes to political things and sociological things,
*  when it comes to matters of culture, there's opinions, you know,
*  and sometimes, you know, opinions vary.
*  And there's a spectrum along with and there's some people
*  that that hold that opinion that are really fucking crazy.
*  And there's other people that are very reasonable that hold a similar opinion.
*  But they have a justification for it and they have a rationalization for it.
*  And they have thought behind it. Yeah.
*  And this is, you know, one of the beautiful things about doing a podcast
*  like this is we're talking about like phones, like leaving your phone.
*  For three hours, I don't touch that goddamn thing.
*  And I get to have a one on one conversation with someone
*  where we're locked in with headsets, where your voice is as loud as my voice.
*  And it's in my head. We're looking at each other across the table.
*  It's a very unusual thing.
*  And it's been a massive education for me.
*  Yeah. Massive. Yeah.
*  To be able to talk to people like you and all the interesting
*  and intelligent people that I get to talk to.
*  It's changed who I am as a human being.
*  And I talk to you and then and then I talk to the folks
*  that are interesting and intelligent.
*  I tell you, it's just saying intelligent.
*  But no, I think the the cancel culture thing and the this idea that,
*  you know, that people want to think in absolutes.
*  Again, I go back to the same point all the time, which is like,
*  be careful, everybody, just be careful because you're never going to be pure enough.
*  And then you start seeing everybody getting devoured.
*  And Matt Taibbi had a good example about that when he was talking about
*  Alex Jones getting kicked off of Twitter.
*  And he's like, whether you agree with Alex Jones or not agree with Alex Jones,
*  this is a bad thing.
*  He's like, because it's not going to stop.
*  He goes, when you tell a guy, you're not allowed to have those opinions
*  and those thoughts, and we're going to remove you from the discourse.
*  You can no longer participate in communication.
*  You set a precedent and that you're going to have a slippery slope.
*  And then it's going to come for you because the standards are going to change.
*  And you're seeing that you're seeing that with with liberals.
*  You're seeing that with people who are liberal, but don't toe the line
*  about maybe specific gender issues or trans issues or or whatever it is.
*  Barry Wise from the New York Times.
*  I mean, Barry is my friend.
*  And she's about as liberal as you can get.
*  Perfect example. Yeah.
*  I mean, she's a feminist.
*  She's a Jewish woman.
*  She's super smart and intelligent and educated.
*  But she's also independent enough to understand like that.
*  There's a fucking cult going on this woke cult.
*  And people are going to wake up to it.
*  You know, my friend Bridget Fetice, she found a journal that she wrote
*  when she was 24 and she's you know, she's in her 40s now.
*  She's laughing. Hope she's in her 40s.
*  I didn't feel she's not not being 30s.
*  No, she's why late 20s, late 20s.
*  She's 13 years old.
*  She's wise beyond her years, but she's a very she's she's 39.
*  How good were 37?
*  Whatever. She's awesome. I love her.
*  She doesn't look a day over 41.
*  But she read something that she wrote and she was 24.
*  And she's like, Jesus Christ, I read it.
*  She's like, I must have been.
*  She goes, I was like AOC back then.
*  She goes, I was so crazy.
*  It was embarrassing to read.
*  And now having more life experience and encountering more hypocrisy
*  and craziness in people.
*  Now she has a more nuanced and balanced perspective.
*  How old is she? She's 41.
*  I take that. Look at that, bro.
*  What did I say? 40s.
*  I was right. 40s.
*  You son of a bitch. In the 40s.
*  I felt bad that I aged my friend.
*  But there's a lot of people like that.
*  Look, man, when I was in my early 20s, I was probably well,
*  I'm pretty liberal now, but I was probably even more liberal back then.
*  I just I think that.
*  There's there's a certain amount that I really like about Republicans
*  are the value of hard work and discipline, family values,
*  all those things, particularly as of, you know, become a father
*  and, you know, and become someone who makes money
*  and understands where taxes go and understands fiscal waste.
*  I'm a fiscally conservative person, but I'm a socially very liberal person.
*  And I find myself like a man without an island.
*  I don't know.
*  No, I agree with that.
*  Again, I'm small government.
*  You know, I think everybody just got to stay out of everybody's kitchen.
*  I don't understand the the interest in social issues.
*  I mean, you know, people as long as you don't hurt anybody else.
*  I don't give a fuck.
*  You know, whatever if that makes you happy.
*  Godspeed. Yeah.
*  But can I say Godspeed anymore?
*  I think you could still say that. OK.
*  I got to say it together. Right.
*  I can't say just God. Yeah.
*  It's got a gender.
*  I don't know if anybody knows.
*  Know what? Yeah.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  We sounds like a chain of gas stations on the highway.
*  So yeah, the convenience store, a slurpee.
*  Oh, I used to love slurpees.
*  Cola cola slurpee.
*  They're delicious.
*  I like that blue one.
*  Whatever the fuck that non natural drink.
*  What do they call that?
*  I drove up to the boys, finished swim team the other day,
*  and I had all three of them, Scooter and Slugger and Muggsy in the car.
*  And I said, hey, you know, let's stop.
*  I'll get you guys hungry.
*  And of course, because they're young and they're like, yeah, let's go to McDonald's.
*  So I asked Muggsy, the youngest, I said, what do you want?
*  He says nuggets and in that blue thing.
*  So I got to the window.
*  I said, can we help you?
*  And I said, yeah, I'll take 10 piece nuggets in that medium blue thing.
*  I had no idea what it was.
*  It's raspberry flavor.
*  Blue raspberry. It's like slushy something.
*  But raspberries aren't blue.
*  Not that I know of.
*  But once you finish manipulating them in the DNA,
*  I who knows, genetically modified raspberries.
*  But so yeah, but now I'm thinking about slurpees.
*  It's a delicious beverage.
*  I wish it wasn't so fucking terrible for you.
*  And I wish it didn't give you a brain freeze because I'm greedy.
*  When I get a good slurpee, I get in on it.
*  And then I go, oh, the brain freeze.
*  They say you're supposed to rub your tongue on the roof.
*  You know, yes, stop the brain.
*  And you do that also to stop sneezing, which now is like the, you know,
*  somebody sent me that I'm sure I know who even came up with this.
*  But they said that sneezing in public is now the equivalent of
*  shitting your pants in public because everybody's so freaked out about the pandemic.
*  Coughing, yeah.
*  My dog does a reverse sneeze.
*  I was worried he was like choking.
*  And then the vet says, no, like that's like a reverse sneeze.
*  First of all, one of my guys at work here told me that.
*  And then I talked to the vet about it.
*  It's like, yeah, a dog.
*  It seemed like he was choking, but it's like a like a reverse sneeze.
*  So I talked to him and I'm like, hey, man, you OK?
*  And he's wagging his tail.
*  I'm like, he seems all right.
*  Do I take him to a vet? What the fuck is that noise?
*  I just got I got another dog, got a golden doodle.
*  Yeah, because we just decided to look at it because we, you know, we've always had big dogs.
*  And I thought, well, let's get another dog. What the hell?
*  And so it's part poodle, part golden retriever.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. And great, great personality.
*  She's she's dumb as a brick, but big.
*  She's going to be she's going to be a big a big probably about 100 pounds.
*  Jesus, that's a big one.
*  Big golden doodle.
*  A massive paws.
*  It's already already bigger than we ever thought.
*  She's getting I don't know.
*  She thought you didn't want a big dog.
*  Well, no, we wanted another big dog to go with the other one we've got now is Hendrix.
*  The he's also an idiot.
*  I should have just named him idiot, but he's he's the greatest dog.
*  What is he? He's a he's an English golden retriever.
*  Great. Oh, my God. I love golden retrievers, man.
*  Marshall's the first golden retriever I've ever had.
*  And I just yeah, he's beautiful.
*  You had him here the last time I was here. Beautiful.
*  I can't get over how much I love that dog.
*  Yeah, they look at you with like everything they got.
*  Yeah, they just stare at you and they just say whatever.
*  When I wake up in the morning, he waits for me outside the bedroom door.
*  And then I we have this little like routine.
*  I go, good morning, sir.
*  Good morning. He starts going, oh, oh, oh, oh.
*  He picks a toy up. He has to have a toy in his mouth for whatever.
*  You know, goldens always want to have something to show you.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  He's got like he goes and gets here's a box of toys.
*  We're so spoiled.
*  He's got like a box of stuffed animals.
*  He runs over, grabs a toy and comes over.
*  Oh, oh, oh.
*  And I go, good morning, sir.
*  Good morning. And then, you know, usually we go work out together.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  Ours, ours will spend all day out in the compound trying to catch squirrels.
*  He's fascinated with squirrels like a lot of dogs are.
*  But but he's he's never caught one, but he's convinced.
*  And that's the great thing about retrievers.
*  They're always optimistic.
*  Marshall's caught one and he got it got pulled down from Instagram.
*  The only picture of Marshall's picture with him and a squirrel in his mouth
*  was apparently offensive.
*  It was pulled from Instagram.
*  Good God. I think it's still on my page.
*  Shh. I shouldn't have said that. They'll find me.
*  Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
*  So so it got pulled down because someone said, oh, my God,
*  how could that have a squirrel in its mouth?
*  Yes, because, you know, I don't know.
*  That's what dogs do.
*  That's what cats do.
*  Well, what was going on was we had chickens and the squirrels
*  were stealing the chickens food.
*  OK. Yeah. And Marshall would have.
*  So they had it coming.
*  Kill the chicken.
*  But we would not allow that.
*  So he found it amusing that squirrels were on the menu.
*  That's fantastic.
*  We had Ida Terrier one time that would create Jack Russell Terrier.
*  And and she and this and this cat we had, which was an outside cat, had a had a deal.
*  The cat would catch chipmunks, bring the chipmunks still living to the Jack Russell.
*  The Jack Russell would take the chipmunks,
*  shake it to death, right, and then drop it and leave it for the cat.
*  And then the cat would bring the remainders, the entrails eventually
*  to the front door and leave it kind of like laid out there, like an offering to us.
*  And that's strange. The cats do that.
*  It's a weird thing.
*  It's it's it's weird, but it's it's it's the way of the world.
*  The relationship to the cats, to people is so bizarre because they're basically
*  they've they just accept the fact that you're big enough they can't eat you.
*  Yeah. But everything smaller than them is you can't have.
*  Yeah, I had a bit about it.
*  You cannot have a pet cat and a pet gerbil in the room together at the same time.
*  Like there's no agreements.
*  Like you can have a dog that's a good dog and you can have a pet gerbil.
*  And the dog's like, that's a fucking rat.
*  You're like, no, no, no. That's Mr. Fluffy.
*  Yeah, Mr. Fluffy's our friend.
*  And dog will be like, oh, OK. OK.
*  OK. The doctor said, no, that's a fucking rat, man.
*  You sure? That's a rat.
*  You're like, no, no, no, it's not a rat. That's a gerbil.
*  He's our friend.
*  And the dog, if it's a good dog, there's no rules like that with cats.
*  Cats like you can go fuck yourself the moment you let that cat go.
*  He's going to kill that gerbil.
*  It's 100 percent of the time.
*  It's absolutely true.
*  They make that sound, you know, the cats.
*  Yeah, exactly. Yeah.
*  Their mouth starts moving really fast.
*  They just know, oh, my God, they're so focused on killing something.
*  They are murderers.
*  They kill billions and billions of birds and mammals every year.
*  House cats do.
*  And when people find out that number, scientists found out that number,
*  they were stunned. It wasn't that long ago.
*  It was maybe a decade ago.
*  They did an account of how many cats kill animals
*  and what the number of animals were.
*  I've seen that. It's stunning.
*  Billions a year in this country.
*  You got to wonder, like, what would the ecosystem look like if it wasn't for cats?
*  We got it. We got a we got a hybrid house outdoor cat now
*  that roams around the neighborhood and then comes back occasionally
*  when he wants to hang out.
*  And yeah, it's the same thing.
*  Well, at least he's out in the fucking chain.
*  He's in the food chain. Right.
*  If your cat is out there, he's risking his own ass, too.
*  There's owls and hawks. Yeah.
*  They will take your fucking cat out, especially where we are, man.
*  I tell you, I saw it wasn't that long ago.
*  Driving down by the Boise River, saw this hawk come down, just bam,
*  hit the water, came up with a nice trout.
*  Oh, God. It's so wow.
*  A hawk took a trout out right out.
*  I know eagles do it.
*  Redible. Yeah. These guys are just now they can.
*  It's it's it's fascinating to it's it's again.
*  I you know what? I've been advised before I came out here.
*  Not to talk well about not to talk well about boys.
*  In fact, I had people sending me notes saying just tell Joe,
*  we're full up.
*  The women are ugly.
*  It's just like all this bullshit.
*  Just say shut up about it.
*  You know, when I did that show down there, yeah, I was saying to myself,
*  I was I even said to the audience, I said, I get it.
*  You guys are going to keep this a fucking secret.
*  Yeah, yeah. Boy, boy.
*  Is it I'm going to say it one last time.
*  This is it. Last time. Last time.
*  It's a great fucking place. It's a great fucking place.
*  You got to come back out. I don't know the show.
*  I mean, whenever that happens. Yeah.
*  Yeah. Whenever you're out.
*  I did shows in Houston about a month ago and I felt real scared.
*  Afterwards, I was like, what am I?
*  What am I going to get other people sick just like to tell jokes?
*  It's going to be tough to read the crowd when everybody's wearing a mask to a lot
*  of people weren't a lot of people had them hanging down like on their
*  as a chin strap.
*  Yeah, I like that chin strap or an earring.
*  And they get what the fuck?
*  And then pretending. Yeah.
*  Pretending to do something.
*  So I got my got my mask on here and now I we dodged the bullet.
*  I did a whole weekend at the Houston Improv.
*  It was an awesome time.
*  Hung out with Dan Grinshaw and Willie D from the ghetto boys.
*  Had a good time. It was a lot of fun.
*  But after it was over, I was like, this is not worth the risk.
*  I don't want to infect anybody that I know and love.
*  And I don't want the crowd to infect people.
*  Yeah. And even though the like the health department cleared it
*  and they did temperature checks and they social distance, it's not.
*  You can catch it. Yeah.
*  It's too goddamn contagious.
*  Well, that's just it. And, you know, and again, you can you can believe the science
*  and, you know, but at the same time, disagree with kind of the coverage
*  and think, you know what?
*  You know, if we just if again, going back to the whole idea of objective news,
*  it'd be interesting to see what the coverage would be like if, you know,
*  if we had objectivity in journalism and, you know, they.
*  But it's not going to happen.
*  So I'm just talking out my ass. It's not going to happen.
*  I think there's a there's an opening for it.
*  And I think these independent people, like I was talking about, like
*  Kyle Kulinski and Jimmy Dore and the Hill and these people that are doing it
*  with politics, I think they've opened up the possibility
*  that someone could do it with just just general news.
*  You know, politics is a very attractive way for someone to get into the game
*  because it's it's very click baity.
*  You need to talk about all these issues.
*  You may make a YouTube show.
*  It doesn't have a large boundary that you have to cross like financially.
*  You know, there's not a large price you have to pay before you can enter the game.
*  All you have really need is a camera.
*  It sets up. You have a background.
*  It doesn't have to be any particular kind of an interesting background.
*  And with most software tools for video editing, you can do a lot of shit.
*  But honestly, God, we don't you know, I don't know.
*  I'd argue last thing we need is another political show.
*  I think maybe, you know, but you know, I don't think the last thing we need
*  is another political show.
*  I think the last thing we need is nuclear war.
*  But I think well, another political show is going down that route.
*  But I think that a regular news show.
*  I would like someone to do the same goddamn thing with a regular news show.
*  But the problem is, if you funded it, like if I said, hey,
*  we're going to do the JRE News Network, we're going to treat news
*  the way I treat everything in life.
*  I don't know.
*  So I ask questions and I want to know what the real truth is.
*  And sometimes I'm wrong.
*  But if I'm wrong, correct myself.
*  If we just did a JRE News Channel,
*  then you'd have to hire a bunch of fucking people.
*  And then who knows if they're going to share my philosophy and take on things.
*  They're probably not going to.
*  So someone's going to have to organically come up
*  with a version of it.
*  And then there's the problem there.
*  Like, what's their sources?
*  Are you going to send journalists out in the field?
*  You know, and who are these journalists and what's their qualifications
*  and how much they understand about which subject they're covering?
*  Well, I think that is a great, you know, the great myth.
*  I mean, it was never you never had 100 percent objectivity. Right.
*  I mean, it just never happened because of some of the reasons you're talking about.
*  It's just like with with intelligence reporting. Right.
*  It was it once you get the raw intelligence off the street,
*  you can have an asset tell you something.
*  And that moment, it's just raw intelligence.
*  It doesn't have a right or a left or whatever.
*  It hasn't been through the spin cycle.
*  And then but once that intelligence gets reported back to headquarters
*  and then it starts getting its way through the analysts.
*  And then it makes its way to, you know, others outside of the agency.
*  If we're talking about the agency and it starts getting to the NSC,
*  you know, and every by the time it finishes getting through all those
*  different cycles, yeah, there's a spin to it. Right.
*  And you've lost that.
*  So, yeah, to your point, you're you're absolutely right.
*  You put reporters out in the field.
*  They're going to have a bias as to who they talk to. Yeah. Right.
*  And those people are going to have a bias and then it's going to get back
*  to the editors and they're going to work on it.
*  So, you know, again, I realize that, you know, we're not talking 100
*  percent objectivity, but
*  something better than what we've got, something better than what we got would be nice.
*  And I think the only way that's going to emerge is going to emerge independently.
*  You can't you can't get this with funding.
*  You can't you can't create that sort of a thing with a lot of a lot of money
*  behind it and a bunch of a bunch of different people with vested interests
*  and biases. You're not going to create that.
*  You know, it's going to have to emerge independently. Yeah.
*  And I don't know how.
*  I don't know how. But that's almost what you need.
*  It's almost like you need individual shows that cover individual subjects.
*  Like you need an unbiased environmental show that tells you, hey,
*  this is what we really know about currently about fracking.
*  This is what we really know.
*  And this is how we know it.
*  And these are the people we're talking to.
*  And you have a whole fucking show just dedicated to the dangers, pros
*  and cons of fracking and then have the same thing for coal
*  and the same thing for solar and the same thing for current nuclear technology,
*  which might be the most promising thing that we have.
*  But everybody's fucking terrified of it.
*  Well, then what you get into is you're continuing to slice
*  and dice your source of information and what are you doing?
*  You're still overwhelming the people, in fact, more so. Yeah.
*  And they're like, what the fuck?
*  And so, you know, I don't know.
*  Maybe like a new show is just it's there's too much news.
*  Like you can't really have a new show, because if you have an hour show,
*  like Good Evening, this is the 11 o'clock news.
*  Like, like, how are you going to fit in an hour?
*  You're going to fit this whole world's crazy chaos.
*  Well, you got the intro figured out, though.
*  That's good. Thank you. Yeah.
*  I talk like a newsman. Drive safely.
*  Be careful out there.
*  Did you get a chance to look at that chaos book that I told you about?
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Tom O'Neill, who is a friend of my good friend, Greg Fitzhimmons,
*  wrote an insane book that took him 20 years about Manson
*  and the CIA and LSD.
*  And what did you think about all that?
*  Well, you've touched on some I mean, it's it's or Tom touched on
*  some really interesting things that
*  what I liked about his book and I went through it.
*  I read it is that.
*  He's he's he's actually, I think, very honest about the shortcomings,
*  right, of what he ended up doing, right, and the research that he went through
*  and where he couldn't draw connections.
*  I so I give him a lot of credit.
*  I think it's it's well worth the read.
*  And, you know, it's a it's a hell of a just a personal story
*  that it took him this fucking long, right, to make his way through
*  with a variety of reasons. But,
*  yeah, it luckily it's been a tremendous success.
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  I mean, it's really he sold he sold out almost immediately.
*  And the paperbacks are sold out, too.
*  I mean, he's I think what Manson is a huge draw, right?
*  I mean, it's that but it's also it's a fantastic
*  account account of all the things that happened with the Manson family
*  and all those people that were alive back then about how this guy
*  kept getting out of jail and they they kept arresting him.
*  And they kept saying this is above my pay grade and they would let him out.
*  Yeah. And that's that's for me.
*  That's the strangest part about the whole story.
*  Right. I mean, I you know, this idea that, you know, was Manson,
*  you know, a lab rat for the CIA and, you know, how how
*  how far down that rabbit hole do you want to go?
*  Well, O'Neill is pretty clear about that. Right.
*  It's a that's a not a particularly solid connection.
*  It's a tenuous connection. He called it
*  between one of what used to be a
*  a a a contractor, a researcher for that old chestnut MK Ultra.
*  Jolly West. Yeah. Yeah. Jolly West. Yeah.
*  What did you think about all that?
*  Like, I'm sure you know about Operation Midnight Climax and all this stuff.
*  That's absolutely true.
*  Yeah, I don't know.
*  It'd be interesting to know how many people are aware.
*  I mean, I know some people that, you know, that that's what they do.
*  Midnight Climax. Operation Midnight Climax was a CIA funded
*  program where they dosed up John's.
*  They created brothels and dosed up John's with LSD against their knowledge.
*  Yeah. And without their knowledge and let them fornicate
*  and have a good old time with these ladies of the evening.
*  Man, my God. Watch them and film them and study them.
*  I know. And when you say it that way, I'm in if you want money
*  for produce that movie, but it's it is actually. Yeah, it's true.
*  Look, you have to it fell under the sort of umbrella of this MK
*  altar, which is public knowledge.
*  I'm not, you know, obviously, we're not talking that turn.
*  Well, let's let's also give them the benefit of the doubt.
*  When LSD was synthesized by Albert Hoffman,
*  they really needed to figure out what the fuck this was.
*  And they need to figure out like, could this be used against Americans?
*  Could this be used against the president?
*  What is this? Is this a truth serum?
*  Like, what what are the benefits?
*  What's the pros and cons?
*  What are the dangers of this stuff?
*  Well, that's a national security angle.
*  It's very important that they did study it. Right.
*  And so from context and again, we talked about that towards the beginning is,
*  is, you know, which something we don't normally do. Right.
*  So you were judging people from history now under the.
*  And so we're not using context of what was the what were the conditions?
*  We're talking about the 1950s, the 1960s.
*  Well, yeah, late 40s.
*  I mean, so so what have you got?
*  You got the the end of the World War Two.
*  You got the Cold War.
*  It's the late 40s.
*  You've got the Soviet Union
*  that is heavily invested in
*  in a variety of experiments, mind control.
*  Brainwashing was the sort of the term of the culture. Right.
*  And brainwashing was a big issue.
*  Not a big issue, but it was it captured people's imagination back then.
*  So the late 40s, early 50s, it was Korean War.
*  Yeah, we had an existential threat. Right.
*  We had nukes pointed at each other.
*  We had, you know, drills in schools, kids hiding under desks.
*  I mean, what the fuck? So
*  with the fear that the Chinese or the Soviets
*  were going to develop mind control abilities was pervasive.
*  And it's sound.
*  I know, you know, you talk about it now and everybody rolls her eyes and goes, oh, my God.
*  But you're absolutely right that you have to understand the context
*  with which then Alan Dulles, who was the at the time the director of the CIA.
*  By the way, the guy who Kennedy fired
*  and wound up being a part of the Warren Commission
*  after Kennedy was murdered, which was very strange. Yeah.
*  Oh, OK. Oh, I like that.
*  I like where that could go.
*  So. So anyway, we get we got Alan Dulles, who in 53,
*  early in 53, says, all right,
*  we have to understand what that what the the Soviets are doing,
*  particularly the Soviets.
*  But we also had, you know, again, I'm sure some folks
*  listening know all this, but a lot of folks probably don't.
*  We had POWs returning, American POWs returning from Korea.
*  That was a big issue, right, because some of them came back, again,
*  quote unquote, brainwashed, you know, and some of them didn't want to return
*  because, you know, again, brainwashing, you know, mind control that,
*  you know, perhaps the Chinese had developed these techniques.
*  So initially, the idea was defensive.
*  How do we protect ourselves against this new threat within this Cold War
*  against these enemies who appear to be devoting great deal of resources against this?
*  Well, so initially it started out as defensive effort.
*  MKUltra was the umbrella name for a whole bunch over one hundred
*  and forty projects, sub projects underneath MKUltra.
*  And it was all based around chemical substances, use of chemicals,
*  use of drugs, behavioral issues with with human beings,
*  creating false memories,
*  deleting memory, influencing the behavior again of individuals.
*  There were a variety of projects that fell under this MKUltra.
*  And it was, again, starting out as a defensive issue,
*  but then quickly became sort of an offense.
*  How do we how do we become the leader in all of this, which is typical, right?
*  That's typical on how things develop.
*  It's like cyber warfare.
*  You know, initially it's defensive.
*  Now you think, OK, now we got to figure out how to make it work on our behalf.
*  And sometimes it's important, like when they shut down the Iran nuclear program.
*  Yeah. With a virus, essentially a computer virus.
*  No, absolutely. And where this went off the rails in a handful of ways, in many ways,
*  was testing on unwitting subjects, things such as LSD and a variety of other substances.
*  Yeah. Whoops.
*  And those subjects, unwitting subjects,
*  arranged everything from in federal prisons to state mental hospitals.
*  And that's where Manson comes in.
*  And that's where Manson comes in.
*  And a variety of other people, you know, who it's just it's it's
*  I would recommend people, you know, dig in.
*  Don't you know, don't settle on just one account.
*  And one of the things that people should also do if they want to read about this is read
*  the any testimony that came out of the CIA.
*  And there was some testimony there where there were documents
*  written by the inspector general back in 50.
*  And this this time period was about 53
*  through at least officially acknowledged 64 1964.
*  And then the program was wrapped up.
*  Supposedly there were still
*  federal programs, military programs, others
*  that were still looking into issues related to the use of
*  chemical substances for everything, again, from interrogation to
*  behavioral adjustment.
*  And a lot of these things were funded through cutouts.
*  So you'd set up again, this is, you know, early 50s, mid 50s, early 60s, set up
*  a financing vehicles, you know, through, say, you know, what appear to be
*  non-threatening grant programs, you know, from research institutes.
*  So you'd you'd you'd loop in academic institutions or researchers.
*  And MKUltra had at least acknowledged anyway, over 80
*  academic institutions and others
*  that were either wittingly or unwittingly working on their behalf
*  in various research programs.
*  So, yeah, this this midnight climax program, basically, they they'd
*  kid out a safe house as a brothel
*  and they would have the hookers
*  slip LSD or whatever substance to the to the Johns.
*  And then behind a mirror, you'd have a suppose it like a researcher.
*  Right. I mean, this is where it got weird.
*  Sitting there, you know, having a drink and watching these, you know,
*  the hooker and the John have sex.
*  And then they'd be analyzing the impact of the LSD on them in terms
*  of their ability to talk. And and would they was a hooker in on it?
*  Yeah, the hooker was in on it.
*  And they see an employee of the CIA.
*  You know, you know, and it was it wasn't just the agency, you know,
*  like the army was involved in these things as well. But
*  they would get, you know, cash payments.
*  And oftentimes the get out of jail alive, get out of jail, free card.
*  You know what? Ladies, if you're out there, if you're out there, listen to me.
*  Come on. Whatever you need, come forward.
*  I'm here for you.
*  But there was a show there was a talk.
*  You could wear a Boba Fett mask.
*  OK, we'll hide your identity.
*  Why? But I mean, just imagine, I mean, so it's OK.
*  So this was clearly, you know, clearly was off the rails. Right.
*  And they had one of the guys that was involved in this.
*  He was with what used to be called the Federal Bureau of Narcotics.
*  A guy named White, George White,
*  was, you know, involved in like the San Francisco cat house.
*  And, you know, according to the stories, he'd sit there, you know,
*  with a martini in his hand and watch the couple have sex.
*  And then he and he would have like prepped the hooker to say, OK, after sex,
*  now this appears to be the best time to get them talking.
*  So ask them about their job and let's see if they'll talk about their job.
*  The idea being, could we influence and like entrap
*  potential assets overseas for operational reasons?
*  You know, was it was there some use, you know, for operational purposes?
*  But basically, it was just, you know, George getting his rocks off,
*  watching couples having sex and, you know, very, very strange shit.
*  But you're right in that.
*  And so, again, this this went on till 64 MK Ultra.
*  Interestingly enough, not to not to spend too much time on it, but
*  Richard Helms was the director at the time in the early 70s.
*  And he and a guy named Gottlieb, Sydney Gottlieb,
*  who was the head of technical services of the agency,
*  they agreed that the smart thing to do in 73 before Richard Helms left
*  and Gottlieb left the agency was to destroy all the records.
*  So they purged all the records of MK Ultra that they they thought existed.
*  And this was investigated in the church committee back in 75.
*  And then 76, I think it was.
*  They found a bunch of financial records, you know, that had not been purged
*  because they had been kept, you know, all audits of.
*  And again, you're talking about like 149 sub projects of MK Ultra.
*  So you can imagine each sub project has its own accounting.
*  And you got to turn in your receipts for the LSD that you bought
*  or the hook of your paid offer, whatever, you know.
*  Oh, here's my receipt.
*  Can I have my twelve dollars or whatever you paid for a hooker back then?
*  And so probably not 12 bucks.
*  But they found some financial records.
*  And so that became then the matter of another investigation up on the Hill.
*  And Stansfield Turner, the time the CIA director testified at that point.
*  And that's why I brought my laptop is because Stansfield Turner's
*  testimony is actually pretty interesting as far as MK Ultra goes.
*  And he talks about we've attempted to group the activities covered
*  by the 149 sub projects into categories under descriptive headings.
*  Wouldn't you? In broad outline, at least this presents the contents of these files.
*  The headings of the categories of all these various projects
*  that ran under MK Ultra, and this gives you a pretty good,
*  quick sense of what they were doing at the time.
*  Research into the effects of behavioral drugs and or alcohol.
*  There were 17 sub projects, probably not involving human testing.
*  This is a testimony from the director of the CIA, Stansfield Turner.
*  14 sub projects definitely involving tests on human volunteers.
*  19 sub projects, probably including tests on human volunteers.
*  While not known, some of these sub projects may have included
*  tests on unwitting subjects as well.
*  While not known. Well, not known.
*  And then six sub projects, definitely involving tests on unwitting subjects.
*  Research on hypnosis, acquisition of chemicals or drugs,
*  aspects of magician's art.
*  No, what? Magicians are. Yeah.
*  Yeah, like slipping a Mickey or something.
*  How do you do that sleight of hand?
*  Studies of human behavior, sleep research, behavioral changes during psychotherapy,
*  motivational studies, studies of defectors,
*  assessment and training techniques, polygraph research, funding mechanisms
*  for MKUltra external research activities, research on drugs, toxins
*  and biologicals in human tissue, activities whose subjectives
*  cannot be determined from available documentation.
*  Anyway, it goes on, but it gives you a sense of of of what the hell was
*  happening during this period of time.
*  But again, this doesn't justify it. Obviously it doesn't.
*  But you're absolutely right that to have a full understanding of this,
*  you have to look at the at the context of what
*  where we were at that time and where we were was smack dab in the height
*  and elevation of the Cold War,
*  knowing that our adversaries, our existential threats,
*  were engaged in this sort of behavior.
*  Now, George White was not really a researcher or anything.
*  He would just sit behind a mirror watching some people, you know, get off. So
*  clearly and all the unwitting subjects involved.
*  I mean, but look, they were slipping LSD to agency employees
*  without telling them. Really? Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah.
*  And I mean, it's just.
*  Yeah, it's so it's not that long ago, but it's not.
*  We have to think about it in terms of the same way we thought about Abraham Lincoln.
*  In the context of the times, this wasn't such a horrendous thing to do.
*  They didn't know any better.
*  I mean, it was really they didn't know what these substances would do to people.
*  And there wasn't a lot of ways to find out.
*  You know, the Harvard LSD studies that they did that they believe in part
*  were responsible for the Unabomber.
*  There's a lot of other shit that was responsible for the Unabomber,
*  including particularly his childhood.
*  But they they did a lot of these studies because they they didn't know.
*  I mean, there's it's one way to find out.
*  I mean, how do you get responsible human subjects?
*  How do you get people to do?
*  There's not a lot of ways other than just test people.
*  And unfortunately, yeah, what what this ended up being was, you know, like using
*  using the most marginalized people out there, you know, like sex workers
*  or prisoners or whatever. Right.
*  And oftentimes, you know, Johns are just just on, you know, but that whole thing.
*  But where where Tom O'Neill's book is is, you know, is really interesting
*  in a couple of ways is isn't if you if you jump.
*  So MK Alter kind of finished up in 64 officially. Right.
*  That's when, you know, the inspector general came out from the agency and said,
*  you know, you can't you can't do this.
*  They had a new inspector general and they looked and said,
*  this is clearly not where we are supposed to be.
*  But interestingly,
*  funding mechanisms, you know, that were used to again, to dole out grants
*  or to provide a cutout between government and research that was being done.
*  You know, did some of those continue to exist for other programs, other research?
*  And in 67,
*  you know, you have the Summer of Love, San Francisco.
*  And Tom O'Neill writes about this, and it's very, very interesting.
*  But you had this the Haight-Ashbury free medical clinic,
*  which in part was running a couple of projects
*  that were supposedly getting funding from
*  the National Institute for Mental Health, which had previously been a funding
*  mechanism also for MK Ultra, you know, a few years in the past.
*  And Roger Smith was a guy who was getting his PhD in criminology.
*  He was working at the Haight-Ashbury free medical clinic,
*  and he was also Manson's parole officer.
*  And to your point, Manson was like it was like a
*  a brook trout or a rainbow trout that is in some catch and release stream.
*  Right. He was constantly arrested during the 67, 68 period.
*  And remember, the killings happened in summer, August of 69.
*  And, you know, he kept getting released and he had been in prison.
*  Right. In 67, he had early in that year, he'd been released from prison.
*  So he was on probation.
*  Any violation, certainly some of the things he was getting arrested for,
*  should have sent him back to prison, but he wasn't.
*  So that, to me, is one of the most interesting parts of the book, is this
*  is this is this revolving door that Manson was in.
*  And eventually we all know what happened to him.
*  But, yeah, working at the Haight-Ashbury free medical clinic,
*  that's where Manson would go, along with some of his followers.
*  And, you know, they were, you know, part of a study and, you know, they were,
*  I'm sure, you know, getting their LSD from there.
*  But also this guy, Jolly West, who was involved in MK Ultra,
*  also ended up having an office at the Haight-Ashbury free medical clinic.
*  So, but again, to Tom O'Neill's point.
*  You know that clinic closed down about four months after Tom's book came out?
*  Been open for over 50 years.
*  It's crazy. What are the odds?
*  Yeah, I know. What are the odds?
*  I didn't see that coming.
*  Yeah, but I mean, you know, again, it's I like the I like the book
*  because he does seem to be
*  trying to let the the facts of all his research
*  lead the way rather than trying to prove a point
*  that he comes up with at the beginning of his book.
*  Well, he also exposed the prosecutor, Bugliosi,
*  and all the issues that was going on with him
*  that led to him wanting to follow the narrative that they had laid out
*  that Manson was trying to incite a race war and, you know,
*  and ignore all the other indicators that there was some deeper connections.
*  And yeah, was Manson a was he an informer for the bureau
*  or for local law enforcement or, you know, some other outfit?
*  I, you know, that's hard to tell.
*  Hard to tell.
*  But it's compelling in light of the fact that he
*  kept getting released.
*  He seemed to have a get out of jail free card.
*  He also seemed to have an unlimited supply of acid.
*  That was what's fascinating.
*  And he also seemed to employ the same techniques that apparently the CIA
*  had employed when they had done experiments on prisoners,
*  including the fact that he would, you know,
*  force them into weird sexual situations and pretend to take LSD himself,
*  but not really participate and then, you know, influence them.
*  And he seemed to be doing things to them in terms of like trying to alter
*  their behavior and getting them to do things that were outside the norm,
*  including murder. Yeah. I mean, did he see?
*  Yeah. Did he have a sense from his time there at the clinic or dealing with
*  what's his name, Roger Smith, his parole officer, who again, was also what,
*  you know, criminology doctor, a doctoral candidate, I guess.
*  And so was, you know, but but Manson was, you know, he was not a rocket scientist.
*  He was illiterate for the most part until he ended up in prison and and maybe.
*  Which is why it was so weird that he was able to manipulate so many people so well.
*  But it was also it's like what he was the perfect guinea pig.
*  I mean, you're talking about a guy who spent half his life in federal penitentiaries.
*  Yeah. Yeah. And and and also you're putting it in context of the time.
*  What else did you have going on?
*  You had sort of this again, this awareness of the impact of LSD on the on the counterculture.
*  Right. So you had federal agencies like the bureau, for example,
*  worrying about, oh, my God, what's the you know, what are these hippies going to do next?
*  You know, they can.
*  And, you know, they were worried obviously about the Black Panthers.
*  But it was also more than that. It was it was the anti-war movement.
*  Yeah. Just a general counterculture and the impact of drugs on it.
*  And so it's a it's a fascinating.
*  I think it's a I think it's a very interesting read.
*  And I think it's worth the read, because, again, he's spent so much time
*  trying to make his way through 20 years. Yeah.
*  It's a crazy story.
*  And if you haven't heard the podcast, please listen to it with Tom O'Neill.
*  How what number was that, Jamie? Have any idea?
*  But it's it's just do you think that
*  those times and the shift between the 50s and the 60s
*  are maybe even a bigger cultural shift than we're experiencing now?
*  Because it seems like, yeah, this when the hippies came around
*  and all the drugs and free love and all that crazy shit and Woodstock,
*  it almost seemed like that is even more of a radical change
*  in culture than we're experiencing today.
*  We're experiencing a lot of turmoil today, but so much of it
*  you could attribute to the problems, the economic despair
*  with Covid and the lockdown and then the George Floyd murder
*  and the Black Lives Matter protests.
*  And there's so many different, like tangible factors you could point to.
*  Well, I think in the pandemic is certainly a massive part of it,
*  because if you think about it in this, you know, this in a way
*  minimizes the importance of of the protests and trying to get,
*  you know, policing the way, you know, that everyone agrees it should be.
*  But, you know, if everybody was working and we didn't have the pandemic,
*  right, I would argue we wouldn't have seen the protests in Portland.
*  We wouldn't have seen it. There is this this this.
*  Like we talked about earlier.
*  These people, they have too much free time, too much free time.
*  But I don't know.
*  I mean, I remember I'm old enough to remember, you know, somewhat as a kid,
*  the race riots of the 60s,
*  it's just general upheaval. Right.
*  And I remember, should I remember my one of my older sister,
*  you know, down in the basement painting protest
*  signs with a bunch of her friends, and they were going to head downtown
*  to a protest, you know, and I had a brother, two brothers that were
*  in the Vietnam War.
*  And, you know, there was a lot of, you know,
*  they were definitely at odds with each other. Right.
*  And here's my sister protesting the war.
*  There's my one of my brothers flying F-4s in the war.
*  Another medic.
*  And, you know, so it was a very tumultuous time.
*  I this.
*  I don't think that's where we are now.
*  So I agree with you.
*  I think it was more upheaval then.
*  But it's it's incredibly disappointing now.
*  I thought we were maybe it's obviously naive to some degree,
*  but I kind of thought we were further along than we are now, it seems. Yeah.
*  And so the you know, it's it's
*  yeah, it's very disappointing and frustrating to see where we're kind of at
*  at this moment in time. And again, part of it's heightened by just the
*  uber partisanship of everything. But yeah,
*  but I don't think we're there.
*  And I think this the pandemic has given us all too much time to reflect on shit.
*  And also, everyone's so scared
*  that we're projecting it onto other subjects and that this fear and anxiety,
*  it just accentuates or exacerbates all the other problems that we have.
*  First of all, there's the financial fear, which is doesn't seem
*  as there's a way out of it for a lot of people, for low income people
*  and people that are losing their jobs and people that are losing their businesses.
*  There doesn't seem to be a light at the end of the tunnel.
*  Yeah. No, and it's and we're we're very fortunate in that we,
*  you know, we've been right out that side of it, right, with,
*  you know, with the economy and all that.
*  But yeah, all the people, I mean, look at the situation
*  currently with just the unemployment.
*  But and how quickly that took place.
*  We were riding high as far as the economy goes, you know, just a handful of months ago.
*  And now the number of people who are worried about, you know,
*  do they have a roof over their head?
*  You know, because maybe they're going to get evicted or, you know, what the fuck?
*  Now I can go back to work, but I can't because my workplace isn't open anymore.
*  Well, you used to hear that everyone is one paycheck away. Right.
*  That was the thing.
*  Most Americans, like 40 percent of Americans, are one paycheck away from being broke.
*  Well, what the fuck are you doing now?
*  We're five months later.
*  What does that mean?
*  Well, that's 600 bucks a week. Right.
*  I mean, I know I get it. Right.
*  The government can't continue to keep kicking cash out the door. Right. But
*  there's there's a it's it's not enough, but it's also
*  I mean, what the fuck's wrong with our politicians? Right.
*  I mean, they're agonizing over this. Right.
*  We've got, you know, how many trillions are we in debt?
*  And so fine.
*  But solve the problem now. Right.
*  The pandemic is not it's not going to last forever. Right.
*  We're going to figure this out and everyone's going to get back to to
*  to hopefully some relative normalcy.
*  But in the short term, the fact that the Democrats and Republicans can't,
*  you know, come together and resolve this, they're bickering about,
*  well, what do we do with the next bailout bill or do we have one or how much
*  is it going to be a month?
*  And you got people legitimately standing at the door
*  wondering whether they have to leave their apartment or not, or whether they'll
*  they'll have a place to come home to or how are they going to feed their kids?
*  And you got these these fucking idiot politicians who are just playing games
*  with us. And it always happens.
*  And, you know, they're paid, they're paid.
*  And if there's no consequence to them, then shit doesn't happen.
*  That's I firmly believe that with Washington, D.C., nothing happens
*  in Washington unless the politicians personally
*  feel as if there's some consequence to their situation, their position of power.
*  And they're acting as if, you know, that there won't be any consequence.
*  And so they, you know, they're talking about, oh, we're going to be able
*  to get this done before our August break. What the fuck?
*  They're going to take an August break.
*  I mean, I was stunned by that today when I was talking to somebody in D.C.
*  and they say, yeah, well, they're they're trying to rush us through before the
*  who takes a fucking break in, you know, in a pandemic crisis.
*  Yeah. So but that's what I.
*  Well, we got to go back and see our constituents.
*  Your constituents would probably tell you to stay in D.C.
*  and get something done.
*  But I don't know.
*  I just, you know, at the end of the day, it doesn't do any good to sit around
*  and pitch and moan. But but but I think,
*  you know, unless we have term limits and we have campaign finance reform,
*  I we're going to be talking about this forever.
*  Or mushrooms.
*  Wait, or the some LSD to a bunch of unwitting politicians and see what happens.
*  What what do you think of all this Pentagon UFO?
*  We've recovered crafts, not of this world talk.
*  OK, yeah, I think two things, I think, again, can always be true at the same time.
*  I don't think we're the only intelligent life out there.
*  I mean, I'm classifying us as intelligent,
*  but I also don't think we're hiding some alien spacecraft somewhere.
*  So why do you think the Pentagon would come out and say something like that?
*  Well, I think
*  like we did with with here comes here comes a pitch for my show
*  for Blackfiles to classified.
*  That's Blackfiles to classified.
*  Blackfiles declassified.
*  And how could one watch this show?
*  God, that was a good first season, wasn't it?
*  It was on Discovery on Science Channel.
*  Oh, yes, Discovery.
*  I love the Science Channel.
*  We did an episode on on Advanced Aeronautic Threat Identification Program,
*  ATIP, which was the Pentagon's admitted, you know, came out and said, yes,
*  we have a program that we ran a program.
*  It's no longer in existence called ATIP, which was designed to identify
*  unidentified aviation threats, basically.
*  So it's not talking about UFOs necessarily.
*  It could be a hostile, you know, prototype aircraft that, you know,
*  is what is that?
*  I talked to Commander Fravor.
*  Yeah, you go, David Fravor.
*  David was in here.
*  Yeah. He explained his incident off of the coast of San Diego.
*  And he said they tracked this thing.
*  It dropped from 60,000 feet to one foot above the sea in a second.
*  Yeah. He wasn't it wasn't just him seeing this.
*  Right. No. There's a radar operators on board and his wingmen. Exactly.
*  Yeah. So but I think they said it was
*  tracking them and then it actually actively blocked their tracking.
*  And then no no visible means of propulsion.
*  Exactly. No, no, no, no heat signal.
*  Yeah. I mean, so I think it's look and he's a very credible.
*  He's as credible as yet. Yeah. Right. And and so.
*  I mean, not the only one.
*  Yeah, not everything.
*  I mean, but what do you think of that?
*  Yeah. Oh, I think.
*  Yeah, I think we don't
*  is what I think. I think we haven't resolved that issue.
*  We don't know. There was no
*  final report that gave some sort of conclusive evidence
*  that said this is what this identity or this object was.
*  It is considered still this day to be an anomaly, perhaps of, you know, they don't
*  they just no clarification, which is interesting and all by itself.
*  And again, kind of goes back to this.
*  Look, are we the only intelligent people? No.
*  But do I think that the government is capable
*  all these years of holding a secret like that?
*  No, I really don't.
*  I think there's there's much like with MK ultra or anything else.
*  Eventually, shit hits the fan.
*  Stuff comes out.
*  And I don't think the I'm not one of those.
*  And I say this and I'm sure a lot of people disagree.
*  But I just don't think that the government is capable of keeping secrets
*  for the long term, certainly not of this magnitude.
*  But I think there are certainly things that have happened that we can't explain.
*  And one of them would be the citing by flavor. Yeah. Yeah. So.
*  But materials, you know, materials that that aren't,
*  you know, from Earth.
*  Look, shit hits the Earth from space all the time.
*  And that qualifies as a material that is not found.
*  That's not what I said, though. Right.
*  They said they've recovered crafts, not from this world.
*  Yeah, I'd like to.
*  I would want to sit down with the individual saying that and say, OK,
*  clarify this, please.
*  I'd want to take them to one of them brothels.
*  Yeah. Yeah, exactly.
*  I told absolutely. I sit there with Martini behind that mirror.
*  It was OK, man.
*  Tell me what you really saw.
*  Bring one of those hookers in from the from the 60s.
*  No, no, no, no, no.
*  Don't do that to her or him.
*  No. I would want to know, though, what what you know,
*  what is actually happening and why would they come out with a statement like that?
*  Well, I'm going to tell you something.
*  It's between you and me is second season and black files declassified.
*  We're going to be looking at that.
*  Why do you think I don't know what that that's that's the big question is,
*  why would they say that?
*  That's that's the big question is why would they say that?
*  Right. And I don't have an answer for that.
*  I don't know. And that's why I say it's a shocker.
*  It definitely bears further investigation.
*  That goes without saying.
*  If there was a thing that was coming, they would want to prepare people.
*  And I think if you wanted to prepare people, the best way to prepare people
*  is to slowly give them signs that some shit is about to go down.
*  And one of the best ways to say we have found things that are not of this world.
*  OK, think about that for a little while.
*  We'll see in a few months.
*  A few months, a few months of accepting that without any.
*  See, there's no there's no event, right?
*  It's just a statement.
*  But what's the exact wording?
*  Let's bring that up. Yeah.
*  Exactly. Here it is.
*  Yeah. Crashes.
*  Harry Reid said he believed crashes of vehicles from other worlds had occurred
*  and that retrieved materials had been studied secretly for decades.
*  Yeah. Now, you know, Bob Lazar,
*  do you know the story of Bob Lazar?
*  Bob Lazar was in here and he he said some things that were ridiculed,
*  but turned to be turned out to be absolutely true.
*  One of the things that he said was that there was this element, this element 115,
*  and that they had figured out a way to stabilize this element in these other planets.
*  And that's what they used to propel these vehicles
*  with a different kind of propulsion that manipulated gravity.
*  And it essentially had created some sort of a warp where they they didn't
*  they weren't subject to the same laws of physics with this propulsion system
*  that we are with what we have, which is just igniting fuel and,
*  you know, pushing the explosion, pushes the rocket right into this into space,
*  which could explain sort of the flavor sighting.
*  Yeah. And the way he described these vehicles in the 1980s
*  and the early 1990s is exactly the way Fravor's vehicle worked,
*  exactly the way the gimbal video worked.
*  These things, for whatever reason, they fly one way and then they turn sideways.
*  Like like if you had a plate, the plate turns up and down.
*  And then that's the way it travels.
*  And then somehow or another, that's that's how it travels insanely fast.
*  And it does something to manipulate gravity around it.
*  Yeah, it sounds super weird.
*  But the fact that this guy talked about this in the early 90s
*  and then this is the exact video that the Pentagon refers to,
*  that you actually see these objects that they can explain
*  that don't give off a heat signal, that move in this exact same way
*  at spectacular rates of speed.
*  And then that's how the tick tock craft work, too. Right.
*  Well, I mean, yeah, I.
*  I yeah, it's yeah, there's a there's a leap there, necessarily.
*  Right. You got to make.
*  I don't want to make that leap either.
*  Yeah. What you're saying.
*  For years, I was like, it's all horse shit.
*  Yeah. I mean, I'm not, you know, again, not saying it couldn't happen.
*  I'm just saying there's certain parts of this like, like, OK,
*  Harry Reid talking about it.
*  Well, look, Harry Reid was, you know, was he was very interested in this stuff.
*  He, you know, he allocated some some federal funds
*  to one of his buddies in Nevada to, you know, create a sort of a center,
*  you know, for examining this and for developing space.
*  Exploration capabilities.
*  So Harry Reid is certainly interested in this. They.
*  I talked to Lou Elizondo, who ran a tip. Right. And.
*  You don't really get that answer when you say, OK, Lou,
*  was a tip holding on to materials, you know, that
*  came from alien craft.
*  No. You know, what they're saying is maybe it wasn't a tip
*  that was involved in that.
*  Maybe it wasn't a tip. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Yeah. That's OK. Yeah, I get that.
*  And again, I guess I guess what I'm saying is I'm open to say, yeah, fine.
*  Like anything and anything's possible, I suppose, in this world.
*  Things that I do know is it's, you know, it's
*  I have a really hard time believing the government could keep this all
*  buttoned up over a period of time.
*  And isn't there a genuine ridicule factor?
*  Oh, sure. That would help.
*  I mean, that's that's a part of the whole things about all the UFO stories.
*  They're so ridiculous.
*  Well, that's why, you know, that's why I set up a tip to begin with.
*  Right. It was so, you know, that they could have sort of a legitimate outlet
*  and a place for this to go.
*  But, yeah, Fravor himself talks about it.
*  Look, it's not in their best interest to get back on the carrier and say,
*  by the way, we spotted an unidentified flying object. Yeah.
*  But they did. And
*  yeah, and you're right.
*  So the natural tendency is to kind of look the other way or roll your eyes.
*  And that's and that can act as a deterrent.
*  Yeah. You know, I don't know.
*  I just but I do think that it bears further investigation.
*  There's no doubt about that.
*  And I think that the program
*  that the Pentagon was running, you know, for the minimal cost of that
*  compared to the cost of another air asset or, you know, platform or some sort.
*  I think they should have kept it going. Right.
*  And they should have normalized to some degree
*  because it's in our national security interests to know, have the Russians
*  or have others developed materials or propulsion.
*  Everybody's working on new propulsion systems. Right.
*  Everybody that has the ability and the resources.
*  So hypersonic craft or that's that's just common.
*  That's that's going to happen.
*  And whoever wins that particular race is going to be further up
*  the food chain than everybody else.
*  So it's in our national interest to be exploring any
*  legitimate or potentially legitimate sighting to understand what that is.
*  That doesn't mean you're chasing UFOs or sort of spacecraft from from.
*  It just means you should know what the hell that is or what's out there.
*  So I'm a big proponent of that.
*  I'm just saying also, you have to proceed with caution, you know, for sure.
*  I mean, I feel like the new normal that we're experiencing right now
*  in the pandemic, human it really illuminated to me
*  how easily human beings adapt to things.
*  We adapt to everything.
*  We really do. We just accept it.
*  Well, this is the new thing.
*  We exist like phones.
*  We just we accept the fact that we just always have a phone on us now.
*  And when you and I were growing up, there's no fucking phones.
*  Did you have a phone?
*  You had phones on the wall, right?
*  I mean, with a cord.
*  And if you were lucky, you had a long cord
*  so you could take the phone away from your parents when you talk to your friends.
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Absolutely. We have the dial.
*  We had the dial.
*  And then we got when we got the push button phones.
*  I thought we were the living shit.
*  Oh, yeah. We got the push button.
*  You're a rock star with push button.
*  Man. And then you get, you know, you take that phone.
*  If you got a call from your girlfriend or whatever, you know, you were younger.
*  You go and try to get as far away from your parents as you could.
*  You know, whisper.
*  I can't I can't talk.
*  I can't talk. I came up with star 69. Yeah.
*  Remember that? Yeah.
*  Somebody called you and they hung up.
*  You press star 69 or call him right back.
*  Yeah. Hey, motherfucker, I got new technology.
*  Yeah. What do you want?
*  What do you want?
*  Yeah. I remember when I first used that people like, how did you get my number?
*  I star 69.
*  Now everybody's got a everybody's got one of these, including Mugsy, my youngest,
*  which, oh, by the way, I told him I would mention this.
*  The oldest boy, Scooter, who's just turned 13, he he
*  walked by yesterday before I got on a plane and he said, Where are you going?
*  I said, I'm going to Los Angeles. Why are you going to Los Angeles?
*  And I said, Well, I got a couple of meetings and I'm going to sit down with with Rogan.
*  And, you know, he's watched some of your podcasts and I'm sorry.
*  Yeah. Only the good ones.
*  There were the appropriate ones, age appropriate ones.
*  I don't know which ones those are.
*  There are none. Yeah, there are none.
*  And but he says, Oh, he says, great.
*  Now, as we're having this conversation about you, Mugsy walked by
*  and he's eight years old.
*  He walks by and he stops and he listens for a second and goes, Rogan.
*  And I said, Yeah.
*  He says, You got to see Rogan.
*  And I said, Yeah. And he looks for a second and goes,
*  don't know who he is. Turns around, walks away.
*  And I thought, Yeah, that's it.
*  That's what I'm going to tell Joe.
*  That's perfect.
*  But even Mugsy's got a even he's got a phone. Right.
*  And how old is he? He's eight.
*  Just actually just turned nine. Just turned eight.
*  You know, just about to get mauled by a bear.
*  Well, yeah, that's important.
*  Or lifted off the ground by a hawk or a UFO.
*  Yeah. Oh, yeah.
*  Well, that's the other thing is, is like, you know, again, the idea that they've
*  we've had visitors from another planet.
*  They just haven't decided they got bored with us or something.
*  I don't know. And decided now, fuck it. It's not worth it.
*  I who don't think they're doing that.
*  I think they're waiting for us to fuck up hugely.
*  That's what I think.
*  The hell's 2020? How much more time do they need?
*  I think they're closing in.
*  They're like, these assholes are really close to.
*  Entering war with China or Syria or Iran.
*  Yeah. Well, the China thing. Yeah. Who knows?
*  We haven't even talked to I know everybody.
*  Whenever they hear I'm going to be doing this, I'm sure they probably think
*  I'm going to come on and bash China.
*  China thing is an interesting one.
*  Right. I mean, it is a very interesting one right now because China's been buying up
*  a lot of a lot of assets when they realize that the pandemic was kicking in.
*  And there's a lot of companies that are China's owns a large stake in them now.
*  Yeah. Yeah. No, it's looked at again.
*  Tick tock is about to get banned.
*  Tick tock. That's going to piss off my middle boy sluggo.
*  He's a well, Facebook.
*  Coincidentally, Facebook or Instagram, I should say, is about to release Reels,
*  which is their version of tick tock.
*  Remember how they like they fucking cock blocked Snapchat with Instagram stories?
*  Yeah. Well, they're about to cock block tick tock with Instagram Reels.
*  And then they're going to lure all the kids over to Reels.
*  Yeah, that's the thing.
*  By the time we get, you know, I'm sure it happens with your kids.
*  So by the time you you get hip to whatever trend they got, I just I just said hip
*  to whatever trend the kids have.
*  They're two trends down the road.
*  Yeah. Tick tock is old school. Right. Right.
*  They don't give a shit anymore.
*  Yeah, they're doing some new stuff.
*  But the thing about the tick tock thing that's interesting for this is the tinfoil hat
*  part. Put put that on again.
*  There's always been this talk that Facebook helped Trump win the election.
*  Yeah. And they have been the least reluctant,
*  the most reluctant, I should say, to censor Trump stuff.
*  And and there's a lot of people that think that Mark Zuckerberg is in some way or Facebook
*  is in some way responsible for getting Trump elected because they benefit from all the
*  interaction they benefit from.
*  It's one of the last places where conservatives can freely discuss things and not
*  accept the hydroxychloroquine thing.
*  They've taken that down.
*  But Facebook owns Instagram and Instagram has Reels.
*  And if Tick Tock, if Trump comes in right, but Reels has not been released yet.
*  Correct. I think it's early August, which is like any minute now.
*  Right. So where are we?
*  The third? What is today?
*  Third. Yes. So they come along and they they ban Tick Tock and introduce Reels at the
*  same time. I'm going to be a little bit.
*  Yeah. Yeah. No, I agree on that.
*  But I think what's going to happen is I think they're going to orchestrate a deal.
*  Microsoft will take over at least the US operate with US, Canada, Australia, New
*  Zealand, you know, take over those operations of Tick Tock.
*  I don't know why that would be particularly appealing to Microsoft unless they take the
*  whole global community of Tick Tock users, right, which is whatever 800 million.
*  You know, I mean, there's got maybe 80 to 90 million or so in the US.
*  But I think they want to get a deal done by September sometime.
*  So Microsoft has missed the ball when it comes to mobile.
*  I mean, they fucked up.
*  They they made some critical errors that they could have had a Windows phone that was as
*  big as the iPhone.
*  They were right there. They had their had their phone that looked like Windows 10 where it
*  had the little little tiles.
*  And you could like. Right. I remember I was at the ice house and some guy had a Windows
*  phone. And I was like, what is that?
*  And he's like, it's a Windows phone.
*  He's shown me. I go, that looks pretty fucking dope.
*  I go, how do you like it? He goes, I like it a lot.
*  And then it was done.
*  And it was done. We're talking like this is like 2000.
*  When did they come out with a Windows phone?
*  2008 or some shit, something like that.
*  And they just decided it wasn't worth the revenue stream or wasn't worth it.
*  iPhone came out, if I remember correct, in 2007.
*  I want to say 2007.
*  I think the Windows phone was right after that.
*  They just fucked up.
*  2010 iPhone came out.
*  The Windows. The Windows.
*  OK. So a few years later and they just dropped the ball.
*  They never really caught on.
*  And this is back when Android was really clunky.
*  And that happens quick, too, though, because if you don't get in on the market, right.
*  Yeah. Pretty quick.
*  It's it's you know, you're you're always playing catch up.
*  Yeah. But but now you're right.
*  I mean, you know, it's I look at the I look at the technology, I look at the phones and
*  and I'm not super excited about my kids having phones.
*  But at the same time, then it becomes it's less so during a pandemic.
*  But it becomes a security issue in terms of I want to be able to track them and know where they are.
*  And short of microchipping the kids, you know, then the phone is a pretty good way to know where they are.
*  You just have to as a parent, you just got to be on lockdown all the time with them.
*  Right. Because it's just a you know, it's a window into a lot of shit that you don't want kids of that age to be paying attention to.
*  Right. Exactly. I mean, literally the whole world.
*  Basically. Yeah. Yeah.
*  You give your kid a phone.
*  You're basically they have the Internet.
*  Yeah. Everything. Yeah. Yeah.
*  And I'm clicking on things that put viruses and, you know, all sorts of malware on their computer, on the on the phones.
*  Yeah. No, it's and that's, you know, again, obviously, that brings us back around to TikTok a little bit.
*  But yeah, I it is interesting that the relationship that we're in right now, people would we're having a conversation the other day about are we in a cold war already with China?
*  And the answer is yes. I mean, you know, it's we don't have nukes pointing at each other necessarily the way we did during the Soviet days.
*  But yeah, we're in it. We're in a cold war with China right now.
*  And that's not necessarily a bad thing. Right. As long as we deal with it properly.
*  Right. And, you know, developing better trade protocols, developing a better understanding of of of their agenda, their interests.
*  That's a good thing. As long as you know, as long as we do it again properly.
*  Yeah. So China scares the shit out of me.
*  You know, I was watching a video the other day of the Uighur Muslims and what they're doing and rounding these people up and forcing them on trains.
*  It's like it's terrifying. It's like, what are they doing?
*  And they have no accountability. They don't they don't have to.
*  No, no. Now, she literally has set himself up.
*  We talk about Putin is saying himself as president for life, but she literally has set himself up as president for life.
*  Now, now, if the Chinese economy, you know, goes sideways in a big way, all bets are off.
*  Right. And he may not be as stable as he's been thinking, but he spent years now strengthening and building up the Intel apparatus within China for his own purposes.
*  And further moving away from this idea that somehow China was going to have a rule of law.
*  Right. It doesn't exist there.
*  I mean, they fucked over the people of Hong Kong and we hardcore could have cared less.
*  Right. We were all. Everybody was all upset and angsty and protesting about Hong Kong.
*  And, oh, my God, we got we stand united with the Hong Kong protesters.
*  And then we got, you know, up our own asses because we're all rightly so worried about the pandemic.
*  And, you know, we got an election coming in November.
*  And, you know, while we're all looking that way, you know, she saw an opportunity and just fucked them over.
*  Right. And that's no consequence for U.S. citizens.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  That's just and there's really no consequence.
*  I mean, so far anyway, there's, you know, a few talks of sanctions and, you know, some.
*  But it doesn't mean anything.
*  They essentially use the pandemic to decide to impose the same sort of restrictive laws that they have in the rest of China with Hong Kong.
*  Yeah. Where Hong Kong used to be under British law.
*  And then was it 97 and transferred over to China?
*  Yeah. And it was going to be 2047 was kind of that was the the playing field they had in Hong Kong up until 2047.
*  What kind of goofy ass deal did they negotiate where they gave it up in 97?
*  So stupid.
*  Well, yeah, I mean, they they they ruined.
*  Yeah, they didn't they really didn't have an option.
*  So they felt that they were they were negotiating as best they could.
*  And there was a sense, I think, at the time that, look, we either do this and guarantee some runway for the people of Hong Kong with some pseudo democracy democracy or, you know, I'm trying to just going to say, fuck you, get the hell out.
*  And it's ours.
*  I don't think China would have done that because, look, they they they need Hong Kong as a legitimate financial capital.
*  Right. But I think what's going to happen now, given what they've just recently done, is, you know, they're going to turn Hong Kong at best into a place where they can have a lot of money.
*  They're going to be locked into a a pass through for hard currency, basically.
*  And, you know, you're going to see a lot of people moving out, not just, you know, not just expats and financial institutions.
*  You're going to see a lot of of of the more successful and educated Hong Kong citizens who are running businesses there, who have been running businesses there, saying, fuck it, it's not worth it.
*  And so, you know, I think the Chinese in the Chinese regime, I think, is probably fuck themselves over in a way.
*  But it's just an indication of Xi's mindset.
*  He doesn't he doesn't really care.
*  And it's just like their buildup of military capabilities in the South Pacific, their work in cyber activity, their continuing hoovering up intellectual property.
*  It's not going to stop them.
*  You know, I mean, now, if it's better that we do make an effort, it's better that we do, you know, put sanctions on them for a variety of reasons, including the Uighurs.
*  But will it change overall?
*  Will it change their their behavior?
*  Probably not.
*  It's so weird. So weird to watch it happen.
*  Just it's a it's something that people weren't really terrified of 10 years ago.
*  They weren't worried about China taking over the world.
*  Now it seems like it's a real possibility.
*  Yeah.
*  In fact, it wasn't that they weren't worried about.
*  They were looking at China like, you know, it's a great marketplace.
*  You know, this is where we need to be now.
*  And you could argue the tech companies still do that.
*  Right. The tech companies, they don't look at China, you know, as a threat to national security.
*  They look at China as a as an opportunity.
*  Right. And they always have.
*  So that explains in part, you know, sort of their behavior towards the Chinese regime.
*  But, yeah, make no doubt about it.
*  They've she's got his eyes set on being at the top of the food chain.
*  Yeah. So, you know, we can either deal with it or we can pretend it doesn't exist.
*  You think they're going to ban more companies the same way they banned Huawei?
*  Well, it depends on what happens in November.
*  Right. I guarantee you that Chinese government would like to see Biden win.
*  And oh, yeah, absolutely.
*  I mean, if if if, you know, as would, you know, for their own reasons,
*  I think. You know, and this would people people who who subscribe to the Trump
*  as Putin's puppet will scoff at this idea.
*  But look, the Russians, I think, would prefer to see Biden win as well.
*  Right. I mean, they get back to business as usual, probably ease up on the sanctions.
*  You know, the left, the hard left, anyway, has been very successful over the years
*  at this this Russian narrative.
*  And and fine, it worked for them.
*  You know, it's been three years in this in this in this
*  pushing this this particular narrative.
*  And but I think I think overall the Chinese, the Russians, they would prefer to see
*  someone like Biden come in.
*  I think they feel like it would be a more
*  collegial approach from the White House, less confrontational.
*  And I think that's just where we're at.
*  Look, I mean, you know,
*  Bill Bill Gates, Bob Gates used to be the director of the agency.
*  All right. And he worked for a couple of administrations.
*  And he said himself that Biden's never been on the right side
*  of a foreign policy decision.
*  So that's one area where, again, going back to what we talked about earlier is,
*  you know, if he's going to choose a vice president, I'd rather he choose somebody
*  who's got as much national security and foreign policy experience as possible,
*  because I think that's one area where he's going to be lacking, even though he says,
*  oh, I've worked in foreign policy all my life.
*  Doesn't mean anything just because you were there.
*  Doesn't mean you've got good judgment or, you know, anyway.
*  Yeah, I think it's do you think that the the policies that Trump's put in place
*  for China are actually beneficial to United States?
*  You think it's a good step?
*  Yeah, I do. I do.
*  Because it's put them on the back of China.
*  I mean, it's put them on the back foot. Right.
*  That's not a bad thing.
*  Made them a little less sure about, you know, what they're doing.
*  They've had to think about things a little bit more.
*  They have had to. Yeah, the sanctions.
*  I wish that we would sanction them hard for the Uyghurs.
*  I wish we would sanction them very hard for what they've done in Hong Kong.
*  I'd like to see that happen.
*  I think what we're seeing now, though, is obviously the pandemic has deflected
*  a lot of attention and also, you know, the closer you get to any presidential election,
*  the less shit gets done.
*  You know, it just so I don't know that anything meaningful is going to happen
*  over the course of the next handful of months.
*  And who knows what the fuck's going to happen in November?
*  What do you think is going to happen?
*  I agree with you when you said earlier that you can't believe the polls, right?
*  So I don't believe the polls.
*  I think people are tired of the who are exhausted from just sort of the
*  general drama of having somebody like Trump in office.
*  So I think there's a potential for a lot of people who may like the policies
*  or some of the policies and prefer them to a hard left agenda or a left agenda.
*  I think there's a chance for them to say, oh, fuck it.
*  I just I'm too tired and I don't want that.
*  And maybe they'll look at at Biden and think, yeah, it's a return to some normalcy.
*  Will there be debates?
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  Yeah, I'll bet there ends up being one.
*  Well, yeah, yeah, there's a debate.
*  Yeah, that's where it all falls apart.
*  That's where the wheels come off. Get ready.
*  Get ready to fucking get Trump campaign manager.
*  We want more debates against Biden and sooner.
*  The first one September 29th, maybe they're probably pumping Biden up
*  with steroids and Alpha brain right now.
*  Could you imagine being a lab somewhere?
*  They got a vat from on it.
*  It goes right to fucking IV.
*  I think I heard there's something like 16 states would already technically be done.
*  Yeah, what done by voting by September 29th?
*  They want to try to have some before that.
*  But I think they're only supposed to have three or so.
*  That's crazy. Say that one more time.
*  Sixteen states could be finished by that time.
*  Sixteen states will already have voted because they're doing it with mail in ballots.
*  Yeah. Yeah. This is going to be so strange.
*  This is going to be such a contested election no matter what.
*  And I'm really worried about the chaos that could ensue after it's over.
*  Well, think about that. And that's that's a I mean, look, I'm a big fan of going to the voting booth,
*  you know, actually getting out, driving or walking, going to you,
*  pulling the fucking lever.
*  So can't they do it outside?
*  Yeah. Sure. Social.
*  I mean, obviously, you know, whether permitting, but, you know, fine.
*  You know, I think the problem is.
*  Look, until Trump talked about, you know, the problems with the post office
*  and, you know, mail delivery and the idea that we're going to have mail in ballots
*  as opposed to absentee ballots, you know, before that,
*  you know what, nine out of ten people, that's not statistically accurate,
*  but I'm sure a lot of people would have said to fucking postal system,
*  they can't deliver the mail. Right.
*  And but now because Trump comes out and says, it's going, oh, my God,
*  I love the postal system and I'm he's trying to destroy the postal system.
*  And I think it's like what he did with hydroxychloroquine.
*  Yeah, exactly. The same thing. Right. Right.
*  Look, and I've ordered hydroxychloroquine through the mail.
*  I hasn't arrived.
*  So what am I to think? But I touch death.
*  So I but can you imagine if we have an election where you do this
*  and then you don't know the results for five or six or seven days
*  because they're still counting ballots. Right.
*  And that's yeah.
*  Can you imagine what that that reporting is going to be like?
*  And all the paranoia on both sides, the right and the left going on,
*  you know, exactly what the whole thing is.
*  How about that?
*  And I could be fucking crazy.
*  He's really, really crazy. Oh, God.
*  Right wing, the really nutty conspiracy folks.
*  How are they going to handle that? Yeah.
*  Well, that's that's it.
*  And you got you got people on both sides. Right.
*  Crazy is not limited to one part of the spectrum.
*  So you got people on both sides.
*  And if you the beauty of the elections in the past have been
*  by the end of the night, you know, got a winner.
*  Right. And now if you don't know and you can't tell me that
*  and it's not, you know, I'm just I'm just saying the realities are
*  you got to be pragmatic.
*  You want to go with all, you know, mail ballots or whatever.
*  Hey, just be aware of the fact that you can have a lot of problems,
*  a lot of disqualified ballots because of a variety of reasons,
*  a lot of lost ballots, a lot of people.
*  And so if if if what you want to do is sow chaos, right.
*  And dissent and further this divide, then, yeah, that's a pretty good way to do it.
*  Or you can figure out how to fucking get everybody the ballots, right.
*  To the polling booths and make that happen.
*  Just fucking do it. Right.
*  And if you want to have ballot
*  voting booths where people wear masks and, you know, and hazmat suits and fine.
*  Right. But figure out a way to get people to the voting booth
*  because and it's not I don't you know, it's I don't think that the mail in thing
*  is could be wrought with fraud like the White House, you know, like Trump is,
*  you know, it could be lots of fraud.
*  I think it's just pragmatic says
*  you could have a lot of logistical problems with you.
*  Well, I don't understand why they can't vote online.
*  Why can you bank online, but you can't vote online?
*  How is that not? Yeah.
*  And the thing is, if you could vote online, if people didn't have to physically
*  go to a place, you know, many more people would vote probably insane.
*  Because what is the number now?
*  Like what percentage of people now vote? Is it like 40 percent?
*  Yeah. Somewhere in the 40 percentile.
*  I bet we get that bitch up to 70. Yeah.
*  I bet we get it up pretty high.
*  If you could register on your phone and vote on your phone.
*  My God. Why can't you do that?
*  Well, there's there's security issues related to that, as we all know,
*  in terms of the hijacking of the or the security of the of the system
*  that would be in place.
*  People click on every fucking link.
*  Someone sends them a text message. Yeah.
*  What's that click? There is that.
*  No, I agree with you in the sense that it would theoretically it would
*  it would improve the turnout for sure.
*  And it would certainly make life easier for a lot of people.
*  I just as with and again, my issue with the mail isn't
*  isn't the fraud issue so much as just the logistics of it.
*  Right. And that and that that that delay.
*  Yeah. And and also the potential to have a lot of ballots just
*  being disqualified or being put in question.
*  The same thing with online voting.
*  I'm worried about the chaos.
*  I'm worried about the civil unrest.
*  Really, I really think that that could be the big one.
*  I think we should you know what?
*  If I think if Congress would do its job, they would just say,
*  you know what, the elections are coming.
*  They're going to be right on time and you're going to go to your voting
*  polling places and we're going to put in place special times
*  for elderly citizens to vote if they want to have a super safe environment.
*  They can only vote like that's like you do at Costco.
*  Costco in our area had like seven to nine a.m.
*  was only for people over 60.
*  Fine. If Costco can do that shit,
*  I'm pretty sure we could do that with voting booths.
*  Yeah. Why? How hard would just make it happen?
*  But but again, it's it's temperature checks.
*  Socially distance everybody.
*  Everybody wears a mask. Do it right.
*  Give it plenty of time. Set up enough booths.
*  And if you want to do it over a two day period, fine.
*  Why not? But at least you're at least you're establishing protocols that are are are.
*  Yeah, I don't know.
*  How about where about the chaos?
*  I mean, if you're going to let people vote by mail in September,
*  how about let them show up at the polls that early as well?
*  So you really could socially distance everybody.
*  You really could absolutely ensure that everybody's safe.
*  Yeah, just spread it out.
*  Yeah. Spread it out over a designated period of time.
*  We have five business days.
*  And you'd have like open scoring like a boxing match would be fucking tremendous.
*  As you roll up on the voting booth, you got the numbers right up there.
*  So it's like a Jerry Lewis.
*  I hear and fix this.
*  Yeah. God damn hippies.
*  You're going to elect that by me.
*  He can't even talk.
*  Damn it. Yeah.
*  Trump's a dictator of the Marxists.
*  Trump's a dictator.
*  He's not going to leave the White House if he loses.
*  Do you understand that we're going to have civil war?
*  That man won't leave. He's a tyrant.
*  Yeah. I just wish there was somebody I could get behind.
*  I wish there was somebody that just made sense.
*  Somebody just like that stood out and just like, that's our guy or girl.
*  Yeah. That's the person.
*  Condoleezza Rice and Nikki Haley.
*  I would like to see that team.
*  Yeah. I mean, for the Republicans, I know that on the damn side, they go up.
*  No, they wouldn't.
*  But that would have been a nice, that would have been a good team.
*  Well, once if Trump does lose or if it goes to, you know, if he makes it to 2024,
*  that's going to be real weird because who is next in line there?
*  You know, I've been telling Dan Crenshaw he needs to run, but he's a young fellow.
*  Yeah. He's got plenty of time.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Who knows?
*  He's a very reasonable Republican, though.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
*  I mean, like that's and that's again, that's.
*  Pence is waiting on a sign from Jesus.
*  Yeah. He's but he's he would be the, you know, if Trump wins,
*  you know, he would be the.
*  Yeah. Yeah. The next guy.
*  He's theoretically in line if he wants it.
*  I mean, some guys don't want it, right?
*  Like Al Gore. Yeah.
*  I didn't know. We're wanted.
*  Oh, he did. He did kind of want it.
*  He wanted it then. Yeah.
*  Yeah. I I don't know.
*  I just think I think if we.
*  We're not going to walk the dog back, right?
*  So it's not like I keep talking about centrists and moderates in both parties.
*  And that's just not going to fucking happen.
*  So, you know, we have what we have.
*  We're not going to get a third party that's going to be legitimate.
*  And so what can we do?
*  What sort of things could be done that could change the dynamic
*  or at least get us more likely to have
*  centrist candidates willing to work with each other?
*  And I keep going back to the same things,
*  which are term limits and campaign finance reform.
*  But then I think, well, that's just never going to happen
*  because it's not in their self-interest.
*  And so, you know, aliens, aliens.
*  I think you're right. I think you're right.
*  That's what we need in a few months time when they come out and go.
*  Oh, yeah, it's not just aircraft that we we've recovered.
*  It's we need a wake up call. The actual aliens.
*  Big up. You know, it's interesting.
*  The beginning of the pandemic, I was really hopeful.
*  And one of the reasons I was really hopeful is people seem nicer.
*  It was like post 9-11.
*  Yeah. When everybody was concerned and, you know, they just they just felt
*  like there was more humanity in the air.
*  And I felt like that at the beginning of the pandemic, people were nicer.
*  They were more polite.
*  They were they were really they were feeling fear.
*  And they realized, hey, you know, what's really important?
*  Health and family and your loved ones and people you care about.
*  That's what's really important.
*  So we're all going to lock down and we're going to stay at home.
*  And, you know, me and my family, we didn't go anywhere, man.
*  We just played games and we watched movies every night.
*  And there was, you know, in a lot of ways, it was a bonding experience.
*  You know, we had a lot of good times together.
*  We cooked all our meals at home, right, because we couldn't go out to dinner.
*  Right. And we just stayed at home and played.
*  And we're very fortunate that we have a yard and we have, you know, a dog.
*  And we went swimming and right.
*  Right. You know, it wasn't that bad.
*  It was it was just, you know, it was a time to be thankful.
*  And I felt like I felt like that for my neighbors, too.
*  It's like we were all in that together.
*  Yeah, no, I agree. I think that was that that, you know,
*  only lasts for a short period of time.
*  And then it's you know what it's like.
*  I always equate it to like a power outage, you know, that rides, you know, in a community.
*  And everybody's kind of pulling together.
*  You all sort of it's sort of like you're camping, you know, and for a few hours.
*  And then everybody's down to Home Depot fighting over the last generator.
*  And everybody's worried about toilet paper and bullets.
*  Toilet paper. That was a weird, weird shit.
*  My friend Duncan had was it? No, Tom Green.
*  Tom Green had a really good point.
*  He's like, I think what happens is toilet paper takes up a large amount of space on the shelf.
*  So when toilet paper starts going away,
*  people see that empty space and they start panicking like, oh, my God, I need toilet paper.
*  Because if you have like a thousand people trying to get toilet paper in a supermarket, you're not going to.
*  It doesn't work. No, no, I was I was I was stunned.
*  I will. I didn't see that coming.
*  No, me neither.
*  You know, we we usually we tend to have a pretty good stocked
*  pantry and and, you know, the silos full.
*  But you have a silo.
*  No, I just I just said that.
*  Is it right next to your bunker?
*  It is. It is. It's kind of.
*  Yeah, it's go out there, get some corn.
*  But yeah, I couldn't believe it.
*  We walked into the local Albertsons and shelves were bare.
*  No toilet paper.
*  I thought, what the fuck's up with people?
*  You know, just buy what you need.
*  And I never thought we'd have a run on on on paper goods.
*  But and so it didn't take very long.
*  But I agree with that initial period of time.
*  You know, we were worried about our elderly neighbors.
*  You know, can we get them anything?
*  Are you worried about your your your friends?
*  Can you help them out in some way?
*  And yeah, it was, you know, I feel the same way.
*  We were very fortunate in that we could we could stay comfortably at home.
*  Yeah. And hang out with the boys.
*  And then in our three little dudes, man, you know, after a couple of days,
*  you're thinking, OK, I got to get outside.
*  I can't get out of here anymore.
*  But I had a lot of friends change their opinion on the Second Amendment.
*  Yeah, they were coming to me.
*  Yeah. I had guys like beating around the bush.
*  So what do you have to do to get a gun?
*  Like, oh, OK, I have a real good friend.
*  And his wife is like, you are never having a gun.
*  We're never having a gun in this house.
*  The moment the pandemic hit, you have to get a gun.
*  We need a gun. Yeah.
*  She was immediately need a gun.
*  And he was laughing.
*  He's like, she told me to go get a gun.
*  Yeah. We're on the phone.
*  How do I get one? Go get one. Go get a gun.
*  I'm like, that is so fucking funny.
*  Go to Piggly Wiggly or wherever you get your guns.
*  She's a good person.
*  She doesn't. It's not that she's a bad person.
*  She's her idea was that guns are for bad people.
*  And you have a gun in the house.
*  You're more likely to shoot each other and you don't need that in your life.
*  And, you know, and I think a lot of those friends that I have
*  who have wives like that, they look at me like I'm a caveman.
*  Like, oh, this dickhead, he likes to shoot elk with a bow and arrow.
*  And he's always shooting guns.
*  And he says he's a liberal, but I don't even believe him.
*  I'm like, look, this is the same reason why I know how to fight.
*  Self-defense is fucking important.
*  Like, if some shit goes down, how many goddamn videos you've seen
*  where two people are in a fight and neither one of them knows how to fight.
*  Oh, my God. It's a schoolyard slap fight.
*  Yeah, terrible. Yeah, I don't want to be that guy.
*  No, and I work with my boys to tell them the same thing.
*  I said, look, this is what we have.
*  And so we spend a fair amount of time on it.
*  And I'm not creating bullies.
*  I'm creating guys that can defend themselves, their brothers and their friends.
*  Right. And if you if you see that and and you need to take a stand,
*  then you need to know what the hell you're going to do.
*  Otherwise, you're going to get smashed in the face and you're not going to like it.
*  My kids are allowed to hit me.
*  Not my 23 year old.
*  She hits fucking hard.
*  She can hit hard.
*  She's really powerful.
*  But my 10 year old, my 10 year old leg kicks me at least once a day.
*  I taught her the spot to hit and she fucking digs in with the shin.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Oh, my gosh.
*  She hurts me. A little 10 year old girl.
*  Well, they're there.
*  Their leverage at that height, you know, they're. Yeah.
*  Well, she knows how to do it, too.
*  She's been doing it since she was.
*  I mean, I enrolled her in martial arts when she was five years old.
*  OK, so here she is at 10.
*  She she knows how to kick.
*  So she's she'll like put her dukes up on.
*  Go ahead. Go ahead. Get in there.
*  And she's slam.
*  She slams that shit in there is terrifying.
*  How hard a 10 year old can kick you in your leg.
*  Yeah. It fucking hurts, man.
*  My problem is that, you know, they'll they'll they lay in wait.
*  Right. Yeah.
*  Like Muggsy punched me in the junk one time.
*  Drop me to my knees. I shit you not.
*  He just he literally I wasn't even expecting that.
*  I turned around. He came around a corner.
*  He caught me right in the junk.
*  I was on my knees gasping as you do.
*  Right. It's a it's a it's it's happened a few times.
*  And it's always it never feels any different.
*  And and he sat there or he didn't sat there.
*  He stood there and he laughed maniacally and then he wandered off.
*  And I thought, good God. But it was a hell of a shot.
*  It's not a good spot to get hit.
*  Now, when I was younger, I was convinced that I was sterile.
*  I was like, there's no way I could be having kids.
*  I've been kicked in the balls.
*  I don't know.
*  A hundred times like no, no bullshit by grown men.
*  I've been kicked in the balls a hundred times.
*  I mean, there's no way my balls work.
*  Those fucking battered things.
*  Those poor nuggets.
*  I should have known, though.
*  I have muscles like my testosterone works.
*  I was like, my balls probably work, too.
*  Yeah. Yeah. You know, I just survived.
*  Yeah. Yeah. I just assumed they were just a fucking bomb shelter.
*  But I've had the same.
*  I've had people say the same thing is like, well, what would you recommend,
*  you know, for for home defense and, you know, what?
*  And it is. And it's been a remarkable increase in the past three to four months.
*  Is it a nutty, like 40 percent increase or something crazy like that?
*  Yeah. I mean, and it makes to me, it makes sense.
*  I mean, you know, they realize.
*  Yeah. I mean, why wouldn't you?
*  I mean, you know, your home defense, it's it's it's a pretty basic thing.
*  But it is it is surprising.
*  I do have friends who same way who would like to purchase
*  something for, you know, for for that purpose.
*  But their spouses are like, no, absolutely not.
*  Even still, even still, find a new spouse.
*  Because if your life depend on it and saving your family's life
*  and you realize at that moment that you were wrong,
*  like you could get a gun safe. OK.
*  It's not it's not hard to keep everything safe.
*  You just have to be diligent.
*  You have to be intelligent.
*  You do the right thing.
*  You know, you keep them locked up.
*  It's not that hard, folks.
*  It's really not. But it does come down to, again,
*  the problem is always the people that buy
*  have no education and then don't train.
*  And those are the people that are dangerous.
*  And they're dangerous to themselves or dangerous to their kids.
*  And it's hard to train. Yeah.
*  I mean, it's hard to be depending on where you're at.
*  Yeah. The thing is, like, you know, some places have basic firearm
*  safety that you have to pass.
*  I mean, I think I had a pass like I felt fell on a fucking like
*  multiple choice. It's easy. Right. But they.
*  Sorry. It's a multiple choice.
*  Yes. Yes. No bullshit.
*  But what they don't do is you don't have to show physical proficiency.
*  There's places that you have to go or if you want a bow hunt.
*  OK. Yeah. You have to be able to hit.
*  I think it's like a paper plate size target.
*  You have to be able to hit like X amount of arrows.
*  I think it's 30 yards or something like that in order for them to pass you
*  for a bow. But some places not.
*  It's not consistent.
*  And but with handguns and guns, you could just buy one.
*  You just if you pass that test, no one.
*  I mean, you have to know like on paper what you're not supposed to do.
*  But in terms of like showing any sort of proficiency or I mean,
*  how many people have guns and they've never even shot them.
*  They don't know which way is safe.
*  No, I know. And that's the worst thing you can do.
*  So if you're going to do that, then don't get one.
*  I'm a big believer in that.
*  Just don't don't buy one unless you're going to practice.
*  And you're going to constantly work that mechanism.
*  But, you know, I've taken a handful of concealed carry courses
*  in the past and a couple of times set a curiosity to see what they're doing.
*  And the training is or the the courses are
*  not that good.
*  And then they they spend a fair amount of time on the legal issues.
*  Right. Because that's a big you know, carrying a weapon
*  is a pain in the ass.
*  It's a real pain in the ass.
*  And it's and it's fraught with potential problems.
*  And that's and you see difficulties because people don't understand
*  the ramifications of it. They don't understand that it's, you know, it's
*  it's not fun.
*  It's just it's it's a big responsibility.
*  Big responsibility. It's huge.
*  But you're right.
*  Typical training, depending on where you're at in certain places,
*  it's very difficult to go out regularly, get to the range once a week,
*  which is what you should be doing.
*  Yeah. Yeah, you really should.
*  I mean, when I take a week off and I go to the range,
*  I feel a little rusty, like my first few shots.
*  I feel a little rusty. Yeah.
*  It's muscle memory, but it doesn't it deteriorates unlike some things.
*  Right. It's it deteriorates quicker for, you know, for a variety of reasons.
*  But you've got I can't emphasize it enough.
*  So all those people that have rushed out in the past four months to buy weapons,
*  you better be exercising that thing.
*  Yeah. Please find a place where you can go, please.
*  And learn. Yeah.
*  And I mean, even if you don't if you don't shoot and you make sure you understand
*  how how to tell if there's not a round in the chamber,
*  understand dry firing, aiming, even if you're just going to dry fire.
*  I have friends that are competitive shooters that if they don't shoot every day,
*  they dry fire for 30 minutes every day. Yeah.
*  You know, they practice. Yeah.
*  And it's also, you know, understanding the mechanism, right?
*  Understanding the machine.
*  And so spend time, right?
*  Take it apart. Put it together.
*  Take it apart. Put it together.
*  Just keep doing that. Cleaning it.
*  All those things help you become more aware.
*  And it also builds a sense of responsibility, right?
*  It makes you understand the importance of handling it properly
*  and storing it properly.
*  So, yeah, that's how we sound like a like a gun store.
*  A public announcement. Yeah.
*  Like a gun store.
*  I want to talk to you about remote viewing.
*  Ah, ah, ah, men who stare at goats.
*  Yeah. You're going to do are you going to do an episode of that for your tell?
*  What's the television show again?
*  Oh, thank you for asking.
*  It's Black Files Declassified.
*  I'm not sure if we've talked about it.
*  Science channel. Yeah.
*  And we we've just we've we've had an order for a second season.
*  Oh, congratulations. Yeah, thank you.
*  So we'll be doing at least eight new episodes here.
*  Filming. Do one on that.
*  Yeah. Remote viewing.
*  That's the plan.
*  We're putting together the show map.
*  You know, it it falls in the category of.
*  Once again, kind of like we talked about with MK Ultra,
*  but the idea being initially,
*  it was a defensive concern over what what are our enemies doing.
*  And so the concepts behind
*  remote viewing, much like the concepts behind
*  understanding behavioral conditioning or,
*  you know, false memories, creating new memories.
*  It started because we were concerned about what the enemy was up to
*  and the enemy being the Soviets in the old days and the Chinese.
*  So what do I think about it?
*  Eh, I'm a cynic, I guess is the best way to put it.
*  Yeah, I'm not necessarily buying the idea of
*  of remote viewing of sort of how we want to refer to it, mind control.
*  But I understand why there's or there was interest.
*  I understand why there were programs designed to try to figure this out.
*  Who's the granddaddy of that stuff?
*  This is one guy who's famous. What's his name?
*  I remember from the Art Bell show.
*  Yeah. I got to meet him.
*  God, you'll get it before I was like, yeah, you know what?
*  I'll bet the agency made me forget that.
*  He's a little fellow.
*  I was going to I was about to recall and then suddenly I couldn't.
*  Got him.
*  Oh, that's not him.
*  Ed Dames. That's yeah.
*  Ego Swan is the guy who invented it, though.
*  Oh, he's just a different guy.
*  So Ed Dames is the guy that I met.
*  Yeah, I met him. You met him.
*  Yeah. See if he's still alive, because I'm going to talk shit about him if he's not.
*  Is he nice guy?
*  Let's find out what kind of condition he's in before.
*  He's in a very nice, yeah, very nice guy.
*  Believe it at that.
*  Yeah, I didn't.
*  I didn't believe it.
*  I didn't buy it.
*  But he was telling me that they they actually got some actionable data
*  from his remote viewing sessions that they used.
*  I believe they used for bin Laden, he was saying.
*  I'm like, yeah, yeah.
*  Again, look, I do.
*  I think that there's certain things you can do to to to train your mind to perform better.
*  I think yes. Absolutely. Yeah, sure. Right.
*  So that kind of shit. No, no.
*  So yeah, I think that's what they had a program.
*  The military had a program for quite some time called Super Soldier.
*  And it looked at a variety of things, right?
*  In concert with some various intel community agencies.
*  And it looked at a variety of things, including
*  issue of remote viewing.
*  But mostly what they were looking at is how do you enhance performance out in the field?
*  How do you make a soldier stronger, smarter, safer, faster, all these things? And
*  ultimately, where they settled was essentially technology.
*  I mean, this issue of, you know,
*  they ended up on
*  the things like the X suit and other things that can enhance those skeletons.
*  Yeah, exactly.
*  It can enhance your your your abilities to exist and and to, you know,
*  to hump shit out in the field and and but also, you know,
*  you say hump, you mean carry carry stuff. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
*  It can be really clear.
*  It's a good point to show your sitting in the safe house in San Francisco
*  in 60s watching some hooker hump some John on LSD.
*  Good God, think about how weird that must have been.
*  So weird. Bunch of freaks.
*  And you can kind of do whatever you want because you're the government.
*  You've got a green light to do this.
*  Well, guys like Sidney Gottlieb, who was the head of that operation
*  and guys like George White knows, I'm sure they couched what they were doing
*  because they knew, you know, once it veered off into those whole unwitting testing
*  and all the rest of the shit they were doing, you know that they knew they were aware.
*  Sidney Gottlieb was a very complex individual. Right.
*  And but he knew what he was doing.
*  But that ability to couch it in terms of, you know, we're fighting an existential threat.
*  So we're doing this for national security.
*  I mean, I think it can kind of make it easier for a person to to overlook
*  sort of the questions, the ethical questions, because you're doing it for patriotic reasons.
*  But you've got nukes pointed at you from the other side.
*  And you legitimately feel like, OK, we're going to do this anyway.
*  I'm not sure where I was going with that.
*  But yeah, the the idea of super soldier, fascinating stuff.
*  How far they've gotten with the exoskeleton ship?
*  Well, I mean, they've got several prototypes, a handful of companies out there.
*  Russians have deployed.
*  What do they use for for a power source?
*  Well, say that's part of the problem.
*  Batteries and battery technology being what it is, that's still a problem.
*  Yeah. And that's it.
*  Whoever comes up with the the better battery always wins. Right.
*  And so what they've found so far, anyway, is and they've got
*  they've got some prototypes that don't rely on batteries at all. Right.
*  That just use of essentially spring technology.
*  And, you know, it's taking pressure off of the key joints,
*  allowing you to lift heavier.
*  And that's really where these things have come into play so far.
*  You're not seeing super soldiers out and, you know, the combat, you know,
*  fighting each other and running at high speeds and carrying loads of shit.
*  You're seeing it in fairly pedestrian way so far.
*  And logistics. Right.
*  And, you know, the guys that are loading trucks.
*  Right. And they're doing that in 120 degree heat and need some help. Right.
*  So the exoskeletons have been very successful in that regard.
*  Other technology, though, information
*  and how information flows to the warfighter.
*  All right. So sort of the Google Glass concept and what they're
*  what they're doing with that augmented reality, augmented reality.
*  But the ability to feed information to the soldier,
*  you know, in real time.
*  And then also to take information from the soldier in terms of their
*  their biofeedback and, you know, blood pressure, heart rate, that sort of thing.
*  To tell you that's all very, very important stuff.
*  The problem is sometimes you can, as you know, you can overload that individual.
*  Right. When when shit hits the fan and everything starts to shut down,
*  you don't necessarily want a lot more information coming in sometimes.
*  Right. Because you're you're focusing. Right.
*  And so all this data, you know, sometimes that's not particularly helpful.
*  But the ability to do it in the proper situation is very is very important.
*  So there's a lot of research still going into that.
*  It's just that the early days of, you know, remote viewing and other ways of
*  of creating a different type of warfighter, you know, there,
*  you know, it's more a pedestrian effort right now.
*  So again, Russians are engaged in the same thing.
*  Chinese are engaged in the same thing.
*  Just like we're all engaged in the race for hypersonic
*  unmanned vehicles and weapons.
*  I'm worried about genetic manipulation
*  because I'm worried that we're not going to do it, but they're going to do it first.
*  And that like the idea of a super soldier, like using CRISPR
*  or some of these gene editing tools, that that actually could be real.
*  That you mean you like in a place like China,
*  where you don't get to decide what you do for a living.
*  They really could recruit a large number of people
*  and sort of develop soldiers in that regard.
*  Yeah. And I think that's I don't think that's in the realm of the impossible.
*  I don't think it's not being done.
*  I would be sure. Yeah, exactly.
*  Exactly. So I'm thinking like 50 years from now, like when we're like,
*  is it ethical? Should we do this?
*  And you have a bunch of senators debating it.
*  Meanwhile, in China, they're fucking full steam ahead.
*  Yeah. And I think and here's where it's interesting is because, you know,
*  again, people listening or there'll be some folks listening going, well, you know,
*  come on, fucking ethical.
*  The U.S. Of course, the U.S. government's doing it.
*  And but we are fundamentally different.
*  Yes. MK Alters, as we were talking about it.
*  Yeah, that was a horrendous, you know, situation.
*  Yeah. Right. Went right off the rails.
*  Shouldn't happen. Was exposed. Right.
*  Which is all by itself
*  an indication of of how we're different.
*  Right. From from the Russians or from the Chinese.
*  You think the Chinese are going to hold some in, you know, in their
*  in their committee hearings.
*  You know, they're going to call to the carpet, the PLA Intel operators and say,
*  well, what have you been doing? Oh, my God, this is terrible.
*  Are the Russians are going to do that?
*  Putin's going to call the FSB and and throw them out there in a in a in a
*  committee hearing now. Bullshit.
*  So when people want to talk about how the U.S. is engaging,
*  well, OK, yeah, we've been off the rails at times.
*  We do tend to try to self-correct whichever administration's in charge.
*  But more importantly, we do have and we've, you know, and I hope we maintain it.
*  We have had a track record of transparency to again to, you know,
*  compared to our is it 100 percent transparent?
*  No. Should it be? No. But.
*  Compared to our those others, yeah, we do a pretty good job.
*  Yeah. Yeah. So I would agree.
*  So this remote viewing,
*  did they ever get anything out of it?
*  Was there any data that was there any anybody?
*  Was there ever anyone who was really good at it or better at it?
*  Was there anything to it? No.
*  So how does it still how is it still a subject?
*  It captures the imagination.
*  I mean, it's it's it's like how is Manson still a subject?
*  Well, he's fascinating.
*  And it was a fascinating period of time.
*  Remote viewing is I think it's it's fascinating.
*  It's kind of it's again, it's like so it's like psychics.
*  They wanted to find like don't don't please still actually use psychics
*  for certain like like they try to find bodies and shit.
*  Is that ever just a mystery mystery TV show or PBS or something?
*  I don't know. I hear about it.
*  I guess they do.
*  Bring in psychics.
*  Maybe really? Yeah, I don't know.
*  I you know, I very, very good friend of mine who was a homicide
*  detective in the UK's Met Police.
*  Works with me now and in my business.
*  Diligence, diligence, USA, for all your information and security needs.
*  He never talked about a psychic ever being brought in.
*  And he handled a lot of cases.
*  It's always on TV shows.
*  Yeah. And when I had asked him about that, I suppose,
*  pointed to bring it up as I asked him.
*  No, but it's not what he said.
*  Yeah. No, no, I don't believe so.
*  But yeah, nothing really.
*  I mean, again, maybe there's a file
*  sitting in the retired records office of the agency, you know,
*  we'll never going to see it.
*  But as far as I've seen, it was never a
*  record of success from it.
*  But it is I get why it's of interest and why people are fascinated by it.
*  That makes sense. Yeah.
*  I mean, it's like everything else. It's like, you know.
*  I guess the government had to find out whether or not MKUltra,
*  like when they were doing that, like, let's see.
*  He's the only one way to find out.
*  Well, if you don't believe in it at all, but it turns out to be true.
*  And there are a few people that have developed techniques.
*  Like, look, hypnosis is real. Hypnosis is weird.
*  You know, maybe there's something to this shit.
*  Maybe if you just follow the right techniques and get yourself in the right
*  mindset, you have access to information that's not available any other way.
*  And hypnosis, again, was part of the MKUltra sub projects. Right.
*  And it's because there was concern that, you know, the enemy had
*  this research or that they were making headway.
*  And so, again, a lot of things that develop initially,
*  it's because it's a defensive response, because we learn something about what
*  some hostile entity is doing.
*  And then you have to move immediately to, OK, well, do we need this
*  for offensive purposes? Because if they're doing it, do we need to have that capability?
*  So and I'd always argue with with certainly you go into the realm of cyber warfare.
*  Yeah, you better have that capability, you know, both sides.
*  Well, that's where things like that neural link technology is very interesting,
*  because if it really if somehow or another, you really can communicate
*  with someone who's not there without using any words,
*  which is what Elon said to me, because you're going to be able to talk
*  without using words. Well, if you can do that at a distance,
*  like if you can literally guide someone, like if, say, if you got someone
*  who's on a mission in Afghanistan and you you are watching on a satellite
*  and you can guide them without giving them any noise, without saying anything to them.
*  And you can give them all the data, whether it's through augmented reality,
*  augmented reality, like glasses or something like that.
*  Save a lot of lives and get a lot of jobs done.
*  Oh, no. And they're doing that.
*  I mean, they're, you know, Aberdeen and and other areas.
*  I mean, they're working on some pretty amazing technology.
*  And so that ability to feed a lot of data, like if you're about to go through a door,
*  right, you run up on some target, you know, and you need to know what the hell is going on.
*  And you've got that ability to to, you know, make that happen.
*  That's that's tremendous. Right.
*  It it makes for a safer, smarter, better soldier out there.
*  And so and that's an important thing, right.
*  Because that actually saves lives, like you said.
*  So yeah.
*  But so that is happening.
*  It's it's the it's the idea of, you know, communicating without, you know,
*  it's the woo woo shit.
*  Yeah. That's that's the part that that may be further down the road than Elon Musk thinks.
*  You know, did you have an open mind when you went into this remote viewing
*  discussion sort of?
*  I did. I mean, a little crack in the door.
*  Yeah. Yeah, I did. Yeah.
*  I mean, I think you have to look.
*  Nothing's 100 percent right.
*  It's like you were saying earlier, right.
*  We always want to think we're absolutely right.
*  And I don't I don't ever assume I'm absolutely right on something unless it's two plus two.
*  Right. I mean, OK, that's that's pretty proven.
*  But but so I think you have to go into anything and any anytime you're going to do
*  an investigation, you have to leave the door open a little bit for the unknowns.
*  But you do have to build what you're doing on something sound.
*  So you can't you don't want to base your your your decision making on
*  just a theory or an allegation or belief.
*  Right. You've got it.
*  So every investigation needs to be built on something solid.
*  Otherwise, it's it's just falling apart.
*  And so that's kind of where we, you know,
*  did I mention Blackfriars Declassified?
*  That's where we're doing that.
*  That's that second season.
*  Did I say that? Oh, well, in the pandemic world,
*  we probably won't be able to film until later this year.
*  Yeah. How do you film it? Yeah.
*  Can you just wear a mask?
*  I'm going to just wear. Yeah, I'll wear a mask. Yeah.
*  I'm just stand to every episode.
*  I wear a different mask, like a full overhead mask.
*  Yeah, it'll be fun.
*  Yeah, we'll figure it out.
*  We'll figure it out.
*  I mean, shit, that's this entire town in Los Angeles has been dealing with that
*  bullshit. Yeah.
*  All these people out of work in production companies and all the independent
*  contractors who don't have jobs because nothing's filming
*  and nobody knows how to film and they don't want to.
*  They don't want to take on the insurance.
*  So it's hit that industry hard.
*  I know everybody's like, oh, my God, it's hit the entertainment industry hard.
*  But I think what a lot of they're doing is quarantining people,
*  testing them and quarantining them, forcing them to stay on set,
*  you know, quarantine in a hotel they've rented out.
*  OK, things along those lines.
*  And I know Tyler Perry has been real successful at doing that, but he's smart.
*  Yeah, he's got his own.
*  He's got his own studios.
*  He's got his own setup.
*  And he just has everybody locked down at the place where they're filming.
*  Yeah. But I mean, all those all those people that don't have that option.
*  Right. And they're just like, I know a lot of folks that are, you know,
*  working as camera operators or sound men or just, you know, anything in the business.
*  And they're just, yeah, they're fucked.
*  So well, for the longest time, the UFC was the only sports entity
*  that was functioning.
*  I mean, and we've been doing shows at the UFC for several months now.
*  Yeah. Yeah. Now, which is a good.
*  And, you know, it lends itself to certain activity like the NBA.
*  Now they can operate in this bubble.
*  Yeah. Right. But baseball.
*  Yeah. You know, I don't think football is going to happen.
*  But I mean, it's it's interesting.
*  Everybody was so hopeful.
*  Yeah. And they're like, I will get it sorted out by then.
*  Yeah. Not really.
*  Although my boy Sluggo is he couldn't be happier.
*  He's a basketball freak.
*  And the fact that they're playing.
*  Yeah, it is nice. Yeah.
*  Look, it's nice.
*  You know, audience or no audience, at least people at home have something to watch.
*  You know, I'm very thankful that the UFC puts on all these fights.
*  Yeah. You know, it's given me some interesting shit to watch.
*  What are you going to miss? You're moving out of here.
*  What are you going to miss about California?
*  I ain't going to miss shit.
*  You haven't practiced that before.
*  I'm not. No, I'm an impromptu kind of a guy.
*  I'm going to miss the comedy store and I'm going to miss my friends.
*  It's a lot of restaurants and a lot of a lot of people I know out here
*  that are good people.
*  I just I feel like this place is overwhelming and overcrowded.
*  And I've had enough and I like change.
*  It's exciting. Yeah.
*  Yeah. My my next move will probably be Montana.
*  After that, I'm going to go to Texas and then Montana.
*  Yeah. Don't come to Idaho. We're full.
*  Man, we're full. Yeah.
*  That's what I hear. Don't come there.
*  Well, tell anybody.
*  I look forward to seeing you in Texas, man.
*  Yeah. Come visit me out there.
*  Yeah, I definitely around.
*  Yeah. Get you some real barbecue.
*  Yeah. Austin's a great town and all of Texas is interesting.
*  I'm a fan. Good cats.
*  I'm excited to go there. Yeah.
*  All right. Mike Baker.
*  Thank you very much, sir.
*  Now, I see you'll probably be in another state.
*  He'll be in Texas. I wear my boots.
*  Yeah. You got cowboy boots.
*  Are you kidding me?
*  I got like half a dozen pair of cowboy boots.
*  You kidding?
*  Jamie's going to buy some. Yeah.
*  He's excited about it. Look at him. Thanks.
*  All right. Thank you, brother. Bye, everybody. See you soon.
*  Oh, that was great.
*  Yeah. Thanks, man. Yeah.
*  That's good.
