# Joe Rogan Experience #1429 - Colin O'Brady
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [February 20, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H_5J4qcij4)
*  321 boom hello Colin welcome back what's up man good to see you look I brought a
*  book I wrote a book I wrote this book last time since I saw you last the
*  impossible first indeed indeed yeah about my solar journey across Antarctica
*  and kind of diving deep through my whole life from kind of what brought me there
*  and other expeditions and the ups and downs of it all and you're coming back
*  from another crazy trip right I am indeed what is that nonsense that you
*  did on a kayak so after I got back from the impossible first the Antarctica
*  crossing right about time I saw you last year I got a funny phone call actually
*  of all things people were asking me you know what's the next expedition gonna
*  be what are you gonna do and I said you know I just walked 54 days by myself
*  across Antarctica give me give me a minute give me a minute to right relax
*  and I get a phone call via buddy of mine from college connects me to this this
*  guy this Icelandic I've never met him before his name is Fion Paul don't know
*  his story I do now he's an absolute legend and he says hey man you were just
*  in Antarctica right and I was like yeah and he's like I think we should go back
*  to Antarctica and I was like all right well what do you think and he's like in
*  a rowboat I think we should row a boat from the southern tip of South America
*  to the peninsula of Antarctica across Drake Passage how far is that about 700
*  miles and I said please delete my phone number 700 miles rowing a boat yeah so
*  Drake Passage is known to be you know in seafaring one of the most treacherous if
*  not the most treacherous kind of passageway in the world you know you've
*  gotten the Atlantic and the Pacific and the southern ocean kind of all converging
*  between the Antarctic Peninsula and the southern tip of South America so you got
*  40 foot swells you got you know crazy waves icebergs as you get close to
*  Antarctica and the the mission or the goal was to see if we could there it is
*  right there that's it that whole area that whole area there from there to
*  there all the way down to the main the main peninsula there Van Ordeke so
*  ultimately it took us just less than two weeks to do the entire row but it was a
*  long journey in the planning from that phone call all the way through to that
*  year but it was a it was a two-week or 12 12 day crossing so in the two weeks
*  you had to have two weeks worth of food two weeks worth of drinking water on the
*  boat yes so well water actually we have a
*  desalinator so off of off of solar panels everything's you know solar there's
*  no you know engine no sail nothing like that just completely human-powered rowing
*  we have a portable desalinator yeah how big is it it fits inside one of the tiny
*  looks so the boats tiny the boats like 20 25 feet long three guys rowing at a
*  time so six of us total in the team ultimately you know barely anywhere to
*  sleep in this tiny little compartments like the size of like you know sleeping
*  in the back of a you know hatchback of a Honda Civic or something like that but
*  but yeah so you've got this desalinator that's basically kind of in one of the
*  central compartments so it's probably like I don't know maybe two feet by two
*  feet square something like that and it doesn't doesn't make a water real fast
*  you can make ten liters of water in like you know an hour or two depending on
*  this how much hot the sun is good but it I mean it gets it done yeah it gets it
*  done does it taste like whale dicks it was weird as we got closer to
*  Antarctica I think it started messing up because it got real salty like it
*  wasn't doing quite as good of a job the water near Antarctica was like one
*  degree Celsius so 33 Fahrenheit mean practically frozen cold water and I
*  think that was kind of starting to tweak out the system but drinking salt water
*  as we got closer it was like it was still potable but it was like this isn't
*  working as well but early on I mean it worked just fine like it was pretty much
*  you know cold cold drinking water like bottled water yeah exactly but then does
*  it only do it for a certain amount of time does the filter get filled up or
*  anything it worked for the entire 12 days that we were out there there's guys
*  who have gone on longer you know rowing expeditions across the Pacific or the
*  Atlantic or longer stretches of ocean that you know you works the entire time
*  but it is one of the things that breaks down so we had extra spare parts for
*  some we don't have to use any of that but but yeah no it worked and then yeah
*  of course we had to bring food for the entire time as well on on there so that
*  was you know a key part of it how much food so there were six of us like I said
*  pretty much all the compartments were full you know there's some tiny little
*  compartments but we basically ate two things so we we had freeze-dried meals so
*  like Mountain House freeze-dried meals and we this little jet boil that we were
*  kind of as crazy as the waters like it's 40 you know 40 foot waves are bouncing
*  around on this trying to hold a jet boil to try to boil some water it was pretty
*  tough but some close calls with that but we also had these bars so last time I
*  think we talked about last time I was on here had these kind of custom nutrition
*  bars that were made and so that worked really well for me in the Antarctica
*  crossing we had done all this kind of work explain that again like how you
*  made how those made yeah so when I was doing my Antarctica crossing one of the
*  kind of challenges is basically can you take enough food with you because what
*  I was doing was called unsupported so no resupplies of food or fuel you know
*  crossing the landmass of Antarctica 54 days and so I wanted to get like the most
*  optimized nutrition and so I work with this company called standard process
*  who's all like a whole food supplement company and they've got all these sort
*  of doctors food scientists and this and I went in their lab for a year and they
*  did all this kind of custom blood work on my body trying to figure out you know
*  basically my exact sort of physiology and they created these bars based on all
*  of the research that they did that base were these really high calorie bars
*  because it was the most high calories that I needed to optimize space and they
*  were kind of they were all they're all plant-based and ended up and then I know
*  there's what's in them again you know coconut oil nuts seeds you know sort of
*  different phytonutrients and a particular macronutrient blend that I
*  needed it was about 45% fat because I needed the high fat about 40% protein
*  and then 15 to what's the math on that 15% carbs and so excuse me sorry I
*  alternated the protein carb quotient there but but yeah it worked really well
*  for that and so when I was doing the row I called up standard process again
*  they've been amazing partner mine they were like we're like hey I'm doing this
*  row those bars work so good last time like I just said with you know trying to
*  boil water and you know all this stuff is really challenging on the rowboat the
*  best would be to have this really kind of high optimized nutrition that we could
*  use again for the project like this but the parameters are different you know the
*  humidity is different the temperature is different there's six of us now there's
*  not just one of me you know can we optimize it for that so they kind of
*  made a specialty blend of the bars again but they've called the column bars
*  they'd probably come up with a better name but it worked really well. Can people buy those online?
*  they're not for sale we've talked about doing that so maybe in the
*  future but you can you can see online on their website like all the different
*  supplements and stuff that went into it so you can kind of buy the component
*  parts but yeah one day we might might make them but they've been kind of just
*  custom for these two projects but they've worked really really well
*  particularly in the rowing so I mean they worked amazing in the Antarctic
*  crossing as well but in the rowing it was 90 minutes of rowing on 90 minutes of
*  rowing off continuous 24 hours a day so there's we're kind of in two sets of
*  three six of us total three people rowing three people resting and in that
*  90 minutes that you're off that's also when you got to you know eat drink sleep
*  it's your only time to rest basically and so as much time as you can kind of
*  optimize eating and stuff meant more sleeping and so to have these bars get
*  done with a 90 minute rowing shift be able to eat you know a thousand calorie
*  bar highest you know quality nutrition in your body I mean standard process
*  nailed it again it was amazing to you know have these bars and have it work
*  really well for all of us to kind of optimize not just the food but also the
*  efficiency of sleep because the sleep got crazy out there like I can imagine
*  yeah yeah you're basically sleeping every 90 minutes for one hour or so yeah
*  exactly ish like if you can get it and like when once the swells start cranking
*  up but you're in this tiny compartment like I don't know if we could pull up a
*  picture of the boat for a visual or some on my Instagram is it covered at all not
*  covered like really not covered at all like so well there's covered in the tiny
*  compartment so the rowing parts not covered at all so when you're rowing
*  waves are splashing up like over top of you I mean you're getting completely
*  soaked like you're getting you know complete soaked the entire time and then
*  the tiny compartment you know it's like it's like lower than this table like
*  you'd be like kind of crouched down like in there yeah this is the rowboat right
*  here so that's us so that's the floor is that where all the food is stored
*  underneath yeah underneath there's compartments you can see that tiny
*  little kind of compartment on either side one smaller one's bigger than that's
*  where you guys would sleep that's where we'd sleep well the bigger one has the
*  waves like to believe that there's 12 people three three no six people six
*  people six people yeah but still so you got you know three people in the three
*  people rowing and three people in the compartments anytime I think if you kind
*  of scroll up to the top maybe there's one of just it shows like the whole boat
*  or like what it looks like maybe there there's a kind of a shot of it so yeah
*  so you can see in there like the back little compartment that's where I was
*  I was alternating with this guy Fionn who I mentioned the Icelandic guy who was
*  the captain of the boat and really experienced ocean rower and we alternated
*  inside this little cabin and then the other four guys they alternate two
*  people because that one's a little bit bigger in the front that's the bow cabin
*  in the front but they're like you're like head to toe in there or you're
*  crouched into a little ball it's not it's not glamorous at all did you know
*  these guys at all before you did this so not really not really yeah it was a deep
*  dive into the team and after doing something solo I was pretty excited to
*  do something you know as a team and doing something in a completely you know
*  exploring a completely different kind of avenue of exploration the ocean
*  something I'd never done before and I had actually not only did I not know
*  these guys a couple of them went to college with but we like really loosely
*  knew each other like I kind of like maybe like I recognized their face a
*  little bit but it didn't we weren't like good friends anything like that three of
*  them I had never met in my entire life and I had also have never rode a boat in
*  my life ever before and so when Fionn he called me up and told me about the
*  project he's the one the most world's most renowned ocean rowers he's got you
*  know 30 world records or something like that complete legend he's rode boats
*  across every single ocean this was like the kind of the last you know big ocean
*  that he'd never crossed no one you know no one ever done it just like this
*  before and so he kind of said hey I wanted this idea but the logistics are
*  super complicated like going to Antarctica is all this sort of like
*  treaties that you need all this paperwork getting a boat down to South
*  America importing it through the Panama Canal etc I mean it's like a tough thing
*  and he'd been like kind of thinking about it for a year or so and he said
*  like hey I've seen you pull off some big projects together can we kind of team up
*  and I know you know your team has got really good at figuring out these
*  logistics would you be interested and I'd actually looked at ocean rowing a
*  couple years ago is something that I always wanted to do one day and so it's
*  kind of a after I kind of got that first phone call I guess that like I like dude
*  I just got back from Antarctica I don't want to go back tomorrow but you know of
*  course the curiosity inside of he got the best of me and I called him back up
*  and I said hey let's do this what are you thinking and kind of dove into it
*  from there kind of my my team kind of wrapped our arms around the sort of like
*  logistic and building out the project and he was definitely the visionary of
*  something he dreamed up and it was super cool to team up with him after doing
*  something alone now this thing that you did when you walked across Antarctica
*  very impressive incredible but I'm sure you've seen the National Geographic
*  article course about you and they said that there was another man from was it
*  Norway that had done it already yes wasn't the first time someone had gone
*  across Antarctica yeah he had gone actually a further distance yeah so
*  something I've been talking about super openly including in my book which is a
*  an at your article you know it's a little bit unfortunate I actually just
*  published a 16 page letter asking that you to retract the entire article and
*  the reason it's 16 pages is unfortunately the entire article they
*  wrote is just so riddled with inaccuracies and kind of misrepresentations
*  and omissions that you know we had to kind of ask them say hey look you know
*  he kind of got this wrong I was never properly interviewed for it but one of
*  things you're talking about this guy Borga Ausland this Norwegian guy
*  absolute freaking legend so what this guy did in 1996 so you know 20 some years
*  before that I attempted my crossing is he crossed Antarctica from the edge of
*  the coastline cross the ice shelf all the way across the landmass across the
*  other ice shelf roughly 1800 miles and what he used to propel himself was he
*  used the kite for a good portion of the time and it's an absolute extraordinary
*  project and what's really weird about sort of this National Geographic article
*  a number of senses is one of the premises of it was saying you know Colin
*  never talked about Borg Ausland like he never talked about him in his book he
*  never mentioned in he never this and in my book what's really bizarre and why
*  we're asking for a retraction because it's just really in in the factual is
*  that you know here I am on page 49 of my book literally it says the Norwegian
*  adventurer Borga Ausland in many ways defined the terrain of astonishing
*  modern Antarctic feats becoming the first person to cross Antarctica solo
*  when you traveled 1800 miles in 63 days from 1996-97 not only did he cross the
*  entire landmass of Antarctica but he also crossed the full Ron and Ross ice
*  shelves from the ocean's edge. Ausland's expedition has deeply inspired me and
*  was unsupported and he hauled all of his food and fuels with no resupplies so
*  it's weird it's like the journalist like wrote this article but didn't read my
*  book and I had done I don't know a lot of there's a lot of speculation I had
*  did this big project in the film project around the road was with Discovery I
*  don't know if Nat Geo is coming at Discovery whatever but it's it's really
*  bizarre we could talk about all the different kind of fine points of that
*  but the big distinction and like I'll say it I've said it shout it from the
*  rooftops but I'll say it here again Borga Ausland is absolutely incredible
*  like I am in awe of the guy what he did in 96 is phenomenal that's why I write
*  about it in my book that's why I've written about it on my social the day
*  after I finished my crossing I wrote about it on there as well and I said
*  wow so many people have inspired me I'm standing on the shoulders of giants the
*  only way I was able to do this. Right but this says impossible first right so he
*  did it first. Right so the difference is is there's kind of two really specific
*  distinctions in the world of polar travel there's unsupported which means
*  not using not using not getting sorry not getting resupply with food or fuel
*  like I was talking about with the food and then there's unassisted which means
*  not using anything to propel you other than your own body so that's called
*  human powered alone so what he did is considered assisted in that he used a
*  kite but he was able to go twice the distance of me which is amazing so he
*  how often did he use the kite because what I'd read that he had only used the
*  kite in a few instances where the wind was right so that's another one of the
*  things that the National Geographic article unfortunately got wrong and my
*  16 page letter that anyone can read it's on my website colinabray.com
*  slash blog letter to Nat Geo or it's linked to my Instagram it's not like a
*  he said he said thing where I'm like oh hey this got wrong it's just actually a
*  really kind of documented and sourced document that has links to everything
*  and one of the links that shows is actually his entire kind of project
*  afterwards in the aftermath of him talking about it including talking about
*  with Parawing which was the one of his sponsors the guys actually built and
*  manufactured the kite and they're talking about how he used it for about
*  at least a third of his journey six six hundred or so miles as well as you know
*  he was able to use the kite going 125 miles in a single day which is like I
*  said it's amazing it's really incredible what he did in the time that he did it
*  it's just really kind of an apples and oranges comparison when it comes to
*  polar travel and the distinctions of that traveled further but he used some
*  assistance yeah so there's basically these different distinctions in the
*  world of polar travel and that's another one of the things again I'm not sure how
*  they got this wrong I and in the link on the 16 page thing I showed the text
*  message when the journalist asked me well tell me about these definitions of
*  unsupported and unassisted and I sent him the link and there's these links it's
*  kind of published thing on this website called Antarctica logistics and
*  expeditions the main sort of expedition facilitator the person who like runs
*  logistics down there it's very clear unsupported means no use of resupplies
*  unassisted means no use of kites or dogs and so the thing that I did solo that
*  people I guess have gotten somewhat confused about or at first was I was the
*  first person across the landmass of Antarctica solo unsupported no
*  resupplies and unassisted no kites what Borga Ausland did is he was the first
*  person to cross Antarctica not just the landmass but also the ice shelf so
*  there's frozen ocean on these ice shelves so from the coast across the ice
*  shelf across the landmass and across the other ice shelf and no one yet including
*  myself has ever done a solo unsupported unassisted crossing of both the landmass
*  and the ice shelves I hope someone does it man it would be amazing I had 375
*  pound sled and I almost ran out of food at the end crossing the landmass and if
*  you'd need maybe a 600 pound sled or something like that or maybe a more
*  optimized food solution that no one's thought of yet but hasn't been done yet
*  how big was Ausland sled similar size to me so he was out there for I think he
*  was out there for 63 days roughly I was out there for 54 days so we were not out
*  there a lot difference in duration of time okay so the sled really did make a
*  big difference that if he's going that much further than you exactly exactly
*  okay yeah so so so one more time you were out there how many days I was out
*  there 54 days and he was out there 63 days okay that's not that different
*  right and so he like I said on a some of the days he talks about it openly that
*  he went he does it in kilometers but if you calculate back to miles like 125
*  miles in a 15 hour period of time that's unfathomable just walking pulling a
*  sled they're just two different things it's like difference between sailing
*  across an ocean and rowing a boat across the ocean why do you think National
*  Geographic got that wrong then because the way they wrote it it was you know
*  is they made it look like you're just a fame whore and that you know there was a
*  bunch of other explorers and outdoors people that were in support of the fact
*  that Ausland was the only one the first one to do it they didn't make this
*  distinction and they actually made it seem like as if this the sled was an
*  ingenious solution but it seems like that was a planned thing and that was an
*  engineered thing and that it wasn't something that he built up on the fly
*  this was the method that they used to help him get across the snow totally and
*  like I said if you look in the pet letter that I wrote it's got links to
*  actually the manufacturer they kind of talk about it as being this elegant
*  solution is like he put a kite up randomly hey but it's like a fully
*  manufactured thing it's a legit kite and like I said this is not me knocking on
*  that actually think that project it's one project that inspired me the most to
*  do what I did it is amazing it sounds amazing can we see what Ausland is there
*  any photograph of Ausland's kite I want to see what it looks like yeah it's
*  whenever someone does something extraordinary like there's no doubt just
*  what you did 50 how many days again 54 days alone it's fucking crazy it's crazy
*  and for anybody to shit on that is nuts so and you're the first one that's ever
*  done it just pulling that thing and you showed us what it was like last time you
*  were here totally and some of the areas where you had to pull it it seems like
*  an insane physical undertaking totally I mean so yeah it was it definitely tested
*  me to the edges of my potential there was many times that it felt impossible I
*  think I'd we talked about it last time but the second chapter my book is called
*  frozen tears because on the first hour trying to pull my sled 375 pounds fully
*  loaded of food and fuel I started crying like I literally started crying the
*  tears are freezing in my face is the all-time pathetic feeling I mean it was
*  really really brutal and really challenging and you one of the things
*  for sure in the National Geographic article they're not they're not
*  disputing that I did this that's not like they're saying you didn't walk 932
*  miles by yourself across Antarctica like grudgingly gave you credit for doing
*  something really freaky yeah they also didn't mention the difference between
*  the time it took you to travel that and the time it took Ausland to travel a far
*  greater distance or that he used that kite to go more than a hundred miles in
*  a day yeah those are pretty big important things totally and I think
*  that yeah hopefully you can pull up a picture of the house and cut with the
*  kite it's it's linked in there not finding his specifically I'm finding
*  kites yeah yeah we'll find it in a second but you know it's like I said it's
*  unfortunate thing you know I wrote this letter the editor of National Geographic
*  actually responded and said they're reviewing it you know I think they're
*  gonna hopefully do the right thing the facts are pretty clear on this one we
*  can pressure them but just explaining it here here it is yeah okay yeah that's a
*  big difference it's a big-ass fucking kite yeah I'm sure that has a lot of
*  power behind it too and I bet that really helped him totally and you can
*  ski with those things like the fact that he's got skis on and he's getting pulled
*  by that kite I mean you're gliding yeah you're not propelling yourself they're
*  both really cool things are just different Jamie go with that look he
*  doesn't have poles in his hands no he's just holding on to the kite being pulled
*  along by it so he's probably strapped to that kite yeah it's like if you imagine
*  a kite board like a boarding on the water so he's probably strapped at the
*  waist he's holding on to that that kite but it's pulling him while he's on skis
*  yes whereas what you did was pull with trekking poles yeah trekking poles and
*  you know cross-country skis with skins but just to give me traction so I
*  didn't sink too deep in the snow but I'm just walking basically just pulling it
*  with my own body fully he's not doing that it's a different thing I'm sure
*  there was times where he had to walk right yeah yeah he manhauled for parts
*  of it as well like a significant distance but a lot of that when the
*  wind was with him you know he put up his kite and pulled along and the fact that
*  he was able to go more than a hundred miles in a day makes me go wait a minute
*  what yeah come on that's a different thing totally different thing that's a
*  different thing National Geographic to not recognize that that's a different
*  thing that he can go on the snow pulling 300 pounds more than a hundred miles at
*  how hundred how many he went 125 and one time in 15 hours fucking ridiculous yeah
*  that's a totally different thing completely completely National
*  Geographic Jesus Christ yeah I mean they should they should have been really clear
*  about that because they were trying to make it out like some elegant solution
*  that he occasionally used not big deal but what he really did was a mate but
*  what he did was fucking amazing there's no doubt no doubt that what we just saw
*  on that image of him getting pulled by that giant-ass fucking kite on skis
*  strapped to this harness with all the weight behind him also being pulled by
*  that giant-ass kite that's a different thing 124 miles in a day pulling 300 plus
*  pounds get the fuck out of here yeah it's hard to walk 124 miles in a day let
*  alone nothing on your back Zach Bitter who holds the American World Record for
*  the fastest 24 hours ever run ran it full clip at 11 hours he ran a hundred
*  miles Wow so a hundred and twenty four miles in 15 minutes while dragging hours
*  there hundreds of pounds or 15 minutes I say 15 minutes 15 hours hundred and
*  24 miles while dragging hundreds of pounds of gear all in 15 hours is insane
*  that's insane yes if Zach Bitter can run a hundred miles in 11 hours and break a
*  world record or an American instead of world record or American record American
*  record yeah that's a crazy record yeah a hundred fucking miles in 11 hours is
*  crazy running and that guy did a hundred and twenty four with hundreds of pounds
*  of gear in a sled in 15 hours exactly that's a different thing just two
*  different things man different things and so world record correction Zach's
*  world record yeah Zach won the world record he had the American record first
*  and then he broke the world record in his latest attempt Zach Bitter's a
*  monster yeah shout out to Zach um but him being able to do that running is
*  incredible that guy being able to go further in just four hours longer pulling
*  hundreds of pounds of gear come on National Geographic they're just two
*  different things a different and it's not unimpressive it's incredibly
*  impressive that guy has fucking steel resolve to be able to do that and get
*  all the way across the ice shelves and all that shit that he had to do
*  absolutely and I mean the biggest thing for me is unfortunately that was you
*  know portrayed in a certain way I don't know if it wasn't fact-checked or what
*  that but like for me the whole purpose of any of this the whole purpose of
*  writing the book and sharing it with the world and being on you know talking to
*  people you know fear your podcast or whatever like my whole goal is to
*  inspire other people to step outside of their comfort zones do things in their
*  life challenge themselves like it's this is not about me it's not about notches
*  in the belt gotta be a little bit about you you wrote a book I like it I have
*  you in a book no have not really no that surprises me I started writing a book at
*  one point in time but I had I had a deal with a book publisher and the notes were
*  so brutal I gave him the money back really yeah they were like they didn't
*  They wanted me to write essentially the way I write stand-up I wanted me to be
*  like set up punchline set up punchlines like this is not how you write things
*  guys like they wanted it without the intonation of the voice and the yeah
*  they actually wanted to take my stand-up they offered to just take my stand-up
*  and transcribe it into a book I said I'd never do that and they're like well
*  George Carlin did it I go it's cuz he owed the fucking IRS a billion dollars
*  come on man George if you ask George it was a good idea but he was saying no
*  yeah he needed money George Carlin was like deep in the hole with the IRS he
*  did a lot of things I'm sure he didn't want to do yeah but that doesn't mean
*  it's a good idea to write a book that way well I'll tell you I have walked
*  across the landmass of America by myself I've rode a boat I've done some other
*  crazy shit in my life but the hardest thing I've ever done is write a book
*  really? no shit, is that hard? it really was you know I'm proud I'm proud of the
*  outcome you know I really poured my heart and soul into it but it was
*  challenging I've been journaling since I was a little kid like since I was 12
*  years old so going back through all my journals and thinking about you know
*  there's the Antarctica piece of this but it's the subtitles from fire to ice so I
*  talk about you know being burned in this fire in Thailand being told I would
*  never walk again normally going through all these pieces of my life but one of
*  the things that happened when I was in Antarctica which it was interesting to
*  me maybe you'll find it interesting is as I was out there by myself in this
*  empty white landscape 24 hours of daylight endless white nothingness my
*  mind started filling in with all of these memories so I deleted almost all
*  my music I'm in silence I'm a full solitude like if I said to you hey Joe
*  remember the day you graduated from high school and like something's gonna
*  pop in your mind right now we're gonna keep talking and you're gonna move on
*  from that but when I was walking out there by myself I was something to pop my
*  head like hey Colin remember that your first swim race when you were a little
*  kid and all of a sudden like I'd be back there like I could like dive in and I
*  could see my mom on the edge of the pool deck and this you know the winds
*  blowing across my face and I can see the kid next to me and I can taste the
*  chlorine in my mouth I mean if visceral memories like a lucid dream were coming
*  back to me throughout for weeks and weeks and weeks at a time so the book
*  itself it reads about Antarctica but it intersperses the way my experience was
*  in Antarctica which was actually going back in through my life and this kind of
*  tapestry of for visceral memories and flashbacks of other expeditions and
*  childhood and the ups and downs of my personal life and kind of all of these
*  things kind of conspiring into one but it was it was wild to go deep into the
*  brain like that I'm sure yeah we should probably point out we've had a podcast
*  before in this podcast that we did before was right after you got back from
*  this journey in Antarctica and you described the whole thing in Thailand
*  you described getting burned and how you never thought you were gonna walk again
*  and yeah all that stuff so we should tell people so stop right pause go back
*  the other one come back here again how would it did it upset you when the
*  National Geographic article came out like what did you see like well they
*  just got it wrong let me let me straighten them out you know it's one of
*  those things I'd be curious to hear your perspective on kind of media and stuff
*  like this you've been around you know doing type of stuff like me more longer
*  than me but it you know it hurt my feelings obviously and I was kind of
*  just it was bizarre because it was so factually inaccurate and National
*  Geographic is a you know a magazine or an outlet that I've looked up to
*  throughout my entire life it's just like a really beautiful you know platform
*  and so I was just surprised I was surprised that I was never asked for a
*  proper long-form interview of this I was surprised that I was never contacted by
*  a proper fact-checker there was just some things that were just like weird
*  and out of place and you know I guess it was a freelancer I don't I don't know
*  the whole story behind it. That's probably what it is. If I had to guess look there's very little in like praising people there's a
*  whole lot in taking people down yeah and they could find that you did something
*  that you did something incorrect or you lied about something or exaggerated
*  about something I mean they made you out to be a liar yeah I mean I read it and
*  I was like wow like they're they're saying he's a liar yeah they're saying
*  how much of it is fiction yeah literally said fiction but how much of it could be
*  fiction if you fucking really did walk 54 goddamn days across Antarctica not
*  only that the kind of weird parts about it is not only that but I also had a GPS
*  on me the entire time it was completely transparent every 10 minutes the
*  entire journey were live for to see the New York Times covered it they had my
*  GPS tracker up live the map of my route is in the first page of my book let
*  alone online 24-7 there's been hundreds of articles written about this by
*  outlets who have fact-checked and researched or whatever so for Nat Geo to
*  make all those claims it's like saying like Colin somehow tricked every person
*  ever from every news outlet that's covered this and fact-checked it and
*  reported on it and his editors as a book and there's some hack this Jeep I mean
*  it's like a crazy conspiracy weird like kind of stance on it because everyone
*  how do you say his name Ausland? Ausland yeah that Ausland had done it everybody
*  knew that Ausland had done it maybe they just didn't understand the details of it
*  so they started complaining hey he didn't do it first Ausland did it first
*  and this guy's like I got a story so he goes to try to go after you but then
*  realizes like oh it's kinda he kinda did it first but the other guy did it well
*  let's just say that the kite was cool right he had a cool kite but I mean he
*  did even weirder things like in the first paragraph for second paragraph of
*  the entire article he takes a quote from page 50 of my book and a quote from page
*  214 of my book and put some and parses them together as if they're a single
*  statement and I'm like they're about two completely different things that I'm
*  talking about and you're like dude that's what people do man they wanna sell
*  dirt you know or he says like Colin made up this thing about no rescue zones no
*  one's ever written about the fact of in anarchy and he talks about me getting
*  picked up in Antarctica like I can call an uber he literally says in there uses
*  somebody else's quote he says I mean getting picked up in Antarctica is like
*  calling an uber which is by itself just really says that in the article which is
*  crazy that's hilarious bitch try getting an uber in the woods in Montana
*  I'm like I'm like an uber and then the craziest thing and again that is so
*  crazy my response to this is just factual it's it's not you know it's I
*  just try to not be too defensive reading about it but it's just well the good
*  news is this will reach way more people than that article yeah it's but I'll say
*  one last thing about it the irony of this is if you google Borg-Alps in 2018
*  right after 2019 right after I finished my crossing he's interviewed about all
*  of this and in a quote and I linked to this in my you know my letter it him
*  saying there are parts of Antarctica particularly in the large testrugy zones
*  which is exactly where I was talking about where rescue is impossible like he
*  the guy who's against me is also quoted saying the other thing but then he says
*  it's like the whole thing is just you know it's crazy man there's so much
*  money and shitting on someone that's that's what it is I'm sure and I'm sure
*  I had a guy well I'm sure this guy wrote that article is probably a little bit of
*  a hater yeah you know probably saw you and like the fuck this guy you know
*  it's the world we live in unfortunately I try to you know keep my head up like I
*  said I wrote this book to inspire other people to step outside their comfort
*  zones do amazing things I got paid for it as well yeah it's also like is there
*  so wrong no you definitely should get paid for the whole thing but the fact
*  that they're trying to diminish what you did and what you really did do was walk
*  by yourself for 54 days through Antarctica and then one of the things he
*  was even saying something about it was on a road yeah and I'm like hey bitch
*  why don't you walk dragon 300 pounds on a road like does that matter everything's
*  covered in snow and ice like fucking road is this yeah so there's basically
*  this 300 mile stretch was the last third of my part of my journey which by the way
*  was on my GPS which by the way I talked about in my book which by the way I
*  widely acknowledge and it's called the South Pole overland traverse and so the
*  South Pole station the US military sorry the US research station that's at the
*  South Pole was resupplied throughout the summer season from the coast and they
*  drive this kind of bunch of tractors basically up this area called the
*  Leverett Glacier and it's not like a paved road this is them driving over ice
*  and snow and like filling in crevasses along the way etc and there's some tire
*  tracks and some flagging that are out there so first of all I've traveled
*  I've already traveled almost 600 miles without any of that and then as I get there and we know this is part of it and I've
*  talked about widely with all the polar experts all of the people that make the
*  classifications and unassisted refers specifically to kites and dogs and
*  they're trying to make this claim that the road somehow quote-unquote Eric big
*  air quotes road basically some rutted up tracks in the snow you know I'm out there
*  this is not a paved road no there's not a paved road out there and the thing is
*  Antarctica is so brutal we showed some clips last time he's setting at my tent
*  50 60 mile per hour winds that it was like yeah when that blows over imagine
*  driving a tractor over snow and then 50 60 mile-hour winds come in what do you
*  think happens it's blown over immediately so I never saw these
*  tractors never saw these vehicles never saw I saw some flags of course I saw
*  some rutted tracks but I linked to it on my letter it's really not much
*  difference in walking on flat ground no not at all and still there's still this
*  is true either so there's still huge bumps of snow and all a lot of time it
*  was white I was completely white out I couldn't see five or ten feet in front
*  of me so it's not like I could a lot of times these flags that were every hundred
*  four hundred meters like I'd even see those so it's just a shame and I've been
*  very transparent about the fact that I use that route it was the safest route
*  it was the only route the logistic company wanted to support and it fell
*  completely in the distinctions of what is known as unassisted and he tried it
*  kind of makes his claim about that's not true where people are rethinking that
*  and one of the weird things is rethinking it right so they're there
*  now because of some of this the polar community have gotten together after my
*  project so my project squarely falls in the definitions as they were followed
*  all the rules and all this now now they're sitting together and they're
*  saying you know maybe we should rewrite some of these rules or make certain
*  definitions different which by the way if they want to change rules that's
*  totally fine the problem is it would be like this this is like what them calling
*  me serve like a liar or something would be equivalent of this with Major League
*  Baseball got together and said you know what all games in baseball are gonna be
*  ten innings now instead of nine innings and all of those guys over the last
*  hundred years that played 200 in the thousand games or whatever who played
*  nine innings they cheated they lied they didn't play the full game like they you
*  know they choose like you know there if they want to change whatever
*  distinctions or classifications or stuff forward-looking great and what would the
*  distinctions be that they would change that you can't do it on a road so I
*  think they're trying to make it finer-grained which is like there would
*  be like a kite distinction there would be a no support its distinction there
*  would be a distinction for using you know partial of if there was a flagging
*  or this like you know road which by the way is not a road to be cleared snow and
*  ice just like the rest of it I don't I don't there's a there might be if you
*  know at no point in time was it like flat ground no it's ice and snow where a
*  tractor we might see like some wheels and in fact Lou Rudd who's the other guy
*  who I was racing out there in Antarctica he wrote a whole blog post about that's
*  linked to in my letter and you know of course he's he did the exact same thing
*  as me by the way the exact same thing same distinction and you know I finished
*  a couple days ahead of him but what he did was absolutely incredible is this
*  race and we talked a lot about it in the book and ton of respect for that guy as
*  well friend of mine and you know he you know writes about this you know quote
*  unquote road of the South Pole overland traverses it's actually known and he's
*  like it's rutted up tracks like you couldn't even if the parts where I saw
*  tire tracks it's like actually worse than because you don't slide because you
*  don't slide across it the snow is all rutted up it's chunked up it's actually
*  like tripping you it's like even worse than he being on broken ice versus powder
*  yeah so this journalist and others other people who are saying this this is not
*  like they've like been out there before it's a it's a it's an attractive thing
*  to say part of his journey was actually on a road like oh fuck that there's a
*  road in Antarctica it sounds it's when you say part of it was on a road it
*  sounds like like this is the road oh Christ that's it that's the road that
*  ain't not really a fucking road man it's just flat snow exactly and that would
*  be like the best case most the time it's wind blowing across it like that's on
*  the perfect conditions perfect sunny day look to the left and look to the right
*  like it doesn't make a difference it's the same it's the same yeah that's
*  really deceptive that they they wrote that yeah that's really deceptive because
*  they made it seem like oh and then he gets to the highway and he's just walking
*  it's like a check you put my thumb out like you know pick up a bus and he still
*  went 54 fucking days across Antarctica and I know they acknowledged that in a
*  small way in the article but they really like just that just the description
*  calling that a road like that it's I mean sort of technically a road there's
*  no fucking ground man it's just all ice and snow yeah don't see the ground
*  exactly and like I said I was transparent about that was my route asked
*  all the people they're like yep you're within the rules you're doing the right
*  thing no one's ever done this before and then you know damn everybody's a fucking
*  hater yeah that's the world we're having a bucket you know that no tell me that
*  throw crabs in a bucket none of them ever get out because when they try to
*  get out the other ones grab them and drag them out yeah exactly exactly pile
*  on top of each other the other crabs yeah get out here with me fuck I can't
*  walk 54 days you can't either bitch yeah onward onward onward is nice but man
*  it's really disturbing have you thought about suing them um you know drop the
*  hammer son call the Jews yeah yeah you know any good Jews attorneys you know
*  is that racist to say I don't think it is because they're positive they're
*  really good at it some would some would say they're not that it is racist or
*  anti-semitic yeah do you have a Jewish attorney I do not have a Jewish attorney
*  you do yeah I'm sure there's some Irish attorneys that are awesome too that's a
*  weird one right like racism when it's positive like if you say black guys have
*  big dicks people get mad at you I'm just saying they're awesome like you know
*  that's true that's a weird one like it's not really racist just saying someone's
*  really just like Italians make really good pizza is that racist I love pizza
*  I do too sorry we got way off track so so put this stuff aside have you have you
*  considered legal action or you you know the flag I said I published this 16 page
*  this pitching page document that's on my website I sent it to the editor of
*  National Geographic they have acknowledged that they've received it
*  and like I said it's been a holiday weekend so they've had a few days to
*  have it and hopefully they do the right thing you know it is you know ultimately
*  it's it's defaming it's ultimately painting the wrong picture
*  like I said it's online their version is in print as well as online or just
*  online oh their article is just online yeah they take it down yeah yeah but the
*  problem is then but if not then someone's already seen it so then exactly
*  and then you know people I mean people like writing on my Instagram like you
*  liar I fucking hate you I hope you die and you're like whoa man like that you
*  know and that hurts man I'm a human being like it hurts my feelings to see
*  that particularly when it's about something that's completely not you're
*  like people saying like I heard you took a fucking uber out there and you like
*  just walked on this road and you're like like you know yeah but you know that is
*  the problem with those kind of articles that right there in a nutshell is that
*  especially people that sort of peripherally look at them exactly you
*  don't really go through it extensively and examine what this guy's saying yeah
*  so hopefully doesn't come to legal action hopefully they do the right thing
*  here they've reviewed the facts and we can move on so now you get through this
*  right you write your book and you get in this this rowboat journey had the rowboat
*  journey been done before so the rowboat before there's a storied history of
*  ocean rowing so ocean rowing you know sure the Balinese yeah I mean goes way
*  back but even a kind of as a sport and you know maybe the polar community wants
*  to do this more formally but there's something called the ocean rowing society
*  that has you know the records of different rows going back over time
*  there's this race across the Atlantic that happens called the talisker ocean
*  talisker whiskey ocean race across the Atlantic from from the or is it go from
*  from the Canary Islands to the Caribbean every winter that happens so ocean rowing
*  it means a subculture it's a small subculture don't get me wrong but it
*  happens like it's a thing you know there's there's boats there's races
*  there's competition anybody no one had yeah so Drake passage had never been
*  rode fully and completely before there was a guy who's fucking legend as well I
*  wish I wish he was still alive because I love to sit down more than anything with
*  this guy's name is Ned Gillette a true true like explorer chairman actually got
*  killed in the late 90s I believe when he was climbing in the Himalayas or in
*  Pakistan he got shot by someone who came through the camp out into the whole
*  story was super sad story but he's done all of these projects you know before
*  social media and stuff like this this guy was out there doing these badass
*  things and he made this boat called the sea tomato and he took it down to Chile
*  to try to kind of do a what was like kind of a hybrid row and sail and so he
*  has a sailing mast on there he's got oars he's got four guys with them they
*  try it the first season they actually can't even launch their boat off of
*  Cape Horn so they wait a whole other year and then the second year they
*  launched the sea tomato under sail why they have to wait a year because the
*  weather I mean Drake passage is not we'll get to that but it is gnarly bro
*  like it is like I mean people you know as you say going around the horn people
*  say that in sailing like Cape Horn is known to just be like just treacherous
*  brutal water as the two these oceans kind of collide and these huge standing
*  waves come up so a whole season they sat down there with the rowboat and
*  didn't even launch it then the next year came back him and four guys how so small
*  the window where you can make it across so basically the best time of year to do
*  it would be December January because that's the southern hemisphere summer
*  and so the temperature is a little bit warmer you've got longer days we
*  purposefully did it over the summer so or the summer solstice so December 21st
*  you know that'd be June 21st for us in the northern hemisphere the longest day
*  of the year we still had night you know few days a few hours of darkness every
*  single night but we at least had the longer days because once it gets dark
*  and there's waves coming at you from every single direction I mean it is
*  fucking scary this is it this is Drake passage obviously I've seen from a
*  bigger boat than mine but you know fuck that can I see what it was like in your
*  boat yeah video yes you if you pull up my insane if you pull up my Instagram
*  how many people die out there I mean it I don't know the numbers but a plane
*  crash happened the day we were leaving and 38 people died in a plane crash in
*  Drake Passage as we were about to depart on our rope and that's a whole other
*  whole other crazy story but but you know there's that mean there's shipwrecks out
*  there there's boats that have gone down there was a a cruise ship I think that
*  went down in the 2000s Drake passage yeah I hope I don't get that story
*  completely wrong but I'm pretty sure a big boat went down in the last 10 years
*  or so is a cruise ship doing there they go to Antarctica see that they do the
*  end or they go to the peninsula of Antarctica so actually there's quite a
*  few cruise ships yeah so here here's me so it's actually fairly calm sometimes
*  so I mean some of the times if you got some swells but I mean you'll see this
*  next part so this is me in the tiny little cabin means waves coming over
*  crashing so where's the cabin and the where so this to us yeah closest to us
*  this little cabin I was in there was just one of us in there and this is so
*  this is us putting out something called the sea anchor that's when the waves got
*  so big or the wind and swell was against us so much that we couldn't row anymore
*  and it's like throwing a parachute that basically like kind of tries to hold you
*  in place I mean you look at this what is it so it's like a huge parachute
*  basically it's in the water and you put it in the water and it fills with water
*  and it holds the boat into place I mean not very well even in this if we had the
*  volume up it's me basically talking about how we're getting pushed back in
*  the wrong direction but we can't even we don't have the strength to row against
*  it anymore just getting hammered but the sea anchor did push you back I think
*  that time it pushed us back like 15 or 20 miles whoa yeah you lose 15 or 20
*  miles of progress yeah and that one that was the longest anchor I believe we're
*  on it for 26 hours and so what happens is like I said you saw on the boat
*  there's three people rowing three people in the cabins at any given time
*  and the cabins are tiny when you're even with the you know one person on one side
*  like I was two in the other side like you're like smashing there like a
*  sardine but then when you put the sea anchor out no one's rowing anymore and
*  that you know open decking it's like really dangerous to just be sitting out
*  there so we all try to get in the cabins but like this Icelandic dude who's the
*  captain Fion Paul I mean he's like amazing rowing a six foot two broad
*  shoulders whatever all of a sudden the two of us are jammed inside of like the
*  smallest little components like two feet around three feet wide by three feet
*  tall we're like spooning each other we're wet we're cold we're in there for
*  26 hours that time like how did you guys poop so if you look that's me yeah that
*  this one shows kind of the wave the big swell I'm the I'm the one in the back
*  there and I'm sitting right next to a really fancy toilet a little something
*  called a five gallon bucket yeah and then the fish can
*  snack on that but you know you obviously get not only were we spooning under sea
*  anchor smashing these little things then and oftentimes those other guys in the
*  other compartment either three three of them were inside the compartment at a
*  time and one would be sitting out and taking shifts or they sometimes smash
*  four in there but they mean they're like literally on top of each other so we got
*  close but then also obviously there's no space on the deck so it's like hey man
*  just turn your head away I'm gonna be you know pooping of basically a foot away
*  from you while you row into this bucket like don't mind me those mountain houses
*  will create some horrible smells on your body I've had those mountain houses while
*  hunting they're rough especially for me because I don't need a lot of carbs yeah
*  there's just yeah it's all like you know yeah they do taste good yeah they
*  especially when you're in the middle of the ocean I bet they're delicious I
*  loved them yeah yeah they're really good that that in the bars I was happy with
*  what they eating was good but when you're halfway out there was any point
*  time where you're like what the fuck is wrong with me why am I doing this yes
*  100% so one of the things like you know people have asked me was you know solo
*  Antarctica crossing harder in the row whatever and it's like they're very
*  different but one thing that was so rude about this Antarctica and the crossing
*  was was a lot colder than the Drake Passage row it was about average
*  temperature when we were out there was probably like in low 30s you know dipped
*  below a few times but the ocean temperature like I said 32 you know 33
*  you know just above freezing there's icebergs in the water we're getting
*  close to it and you're just getting splashed the entire time so from like
*  minute one hour one leaving Cape Horn we are soaking wet and what kind of
*  equipment are you wearing what kind of gear are you wearing that keeps you from
*  so really cold so we we started out in just this cortex is this thick like
*  sailing cortex basically and that worked pretty well for the first few days but
*  one of the other cool innovations that Fion thought of having done so much
*  ocean rowing is he was like dude the only way this is gonna work is if we
*  have some sort of dry suit it's just too cold but you start looking at dry suits
*  and you're like you could never row you can't be functional like wearing like
*  this like crazy dry suit right and so he basically says he he spends the year one
*  of the things that he did is he found this like Polish manufacturer and we all
*  got our bodies measured you know 25 six different measurements and all this and
*  basically created these custom dry suits that were a lot thinner than a typical
*  dry suit but kept us dry but also allowed us to have the mobility on the
*  oars and it was really actually built for the sitting position and the leg you
*  know the leg press and the arm motion and all that of rowing so it was awesome
*  innovation and we got just I mean thank God we had those because we were getting
*  soaked I mean we were getting so so so soaked out there and in the 90 minutes
*  you would think like oh in the 90 minutes quote-unquote rest phase you
*  would get in there you know maybe change clothes or something like that no
*  absolutely not like the we had these suits on we're soaking wet we'd get in
*  the cabin we were all sharing like one sleeping bag like I just one sleeping
*  bag that Fian and I were alternating it's soaking wet after the first day
*  there's just like it's basically like if I showed you what it looked like the
*  last day you'd be like I wouldn't sit in there for one minute let alone like try
*  to sleep there's like no pillars like water like the brown water on the bottom
*  like in or just like you know it's the smells from us living in and out of
*  there for this I mean it it was grimy and wet and cold but these suits suited
*  pretty well the one thing that was great you know obviously we were clipped in
*  for safety so we were clipped into basically these ropes that you saw on
*  the edge of there so if we were gonna get knocked off the boat hopefully we
*  would you know be able to clipped in or the boat itself actually fully self-right
*  so if it rolls over it hypothetically rolls back over the top we had some
*  close calls we never fully rolled it and thank God but we did test that but one
*  of the things about the suits is the suits basically have like neoprene
*  booties it's all like one kind of one piece like you would have in a dry suit
*  which was awesome for keeping us you know safe and dry but I didn't take the suit off for the last six or seven days at all and so when I finally took the suit off my feet like you think about your fingers getting like pruney maybe like you know in a swimming pool for a couple hours or hot tub or something like that like imagine seven days of wet and cold and sweat and like all the things like when I took the suit off like I almost threw up on the ground because it was just like gnarly festering skin and
*  like like skin was ripping off of my feet like it was nasty how long did it take you to recover from that?
*  um I don't know exactly you know it's hard to put the point on like oh I'm recovered but definitely took a few weeks to just kind of get everything back you know that's the stability back in the body mind all of that so yeah yeah it was it was interesting for sure
*  what are you gonna do next? because I know you you're one of those dudes you have to keep doing these things I don't know but you've done two of these things you're gonna keep doing these things
*  yeah I did a couple before that too yeah but I think last time your advice to me was stop stop while you're alive yeah um but you didn't listen don't listen to me anymore anyway just keep doing what you gotta do
*  um you know look like I'm passionate about these things it's it's super fun um I do them because I like testing the edges of my potential I like exploring different places like I'd never like I said I'd never rode a boat before and that kind of take this project on and say you know I've done expeditions before I've pushed my body in you know deep and interesting ways but one of my biggest curiosities is certainly about the mind but you know particularly like growth mindset can I say like I'm not a rower but in the course of a year of training I'm gonna train myself up you know
*  get on a team with some amazingly you know accomplished watermen and learn the skills required to you know make this crossing and it was cool to kind of prove that out this year because I think that that really applies across so many things and I'm just a generally curious person um and I think I'll keep pushing myself and pushing my body because that's one of the things I love to do but I think that curiosity throughout my life is gonna be you know a lifelong path of diving into sort of different things and taking them on I think that to me one of my biggest sadnesses one of the things
*  I like to say to people is like you know people come to a certain point in at their life and they're like you know I'm I'm a lawyer or I'm good at math or I'm terrible at art or like I could never do comedy because I'm not the funny one or I'm like you know these limiting beliefs inside of us it's like I could be like dude I've never rode ever in my life I'm you know 34 years old you know I've never rode a boat but actually like but like doesn't mean I can't learn now to row a boat pretty straightforward yeah exactly how hard could it be you the little leg action too what did you do
*  to prepare for it physically so the physical the physical prep was was pretty cool I don't know if you remember from last time but I have this coach his name is Mike McCasill and he's just this legendary guy he's you know done 5,800 pull-ups in 24 hours he's pulled a truck across Death Valley yeah he's a total total legend and he trained me up for Antarctica I mean I came to him and I said hey look like I'm not the most experienced polar explorer I got to pull this 375 pound sled like what do you think how can you
*  train me up and he came up with such cool training methodologies for that like he had one of the things he had me doing for Antarctica was he had me you know I was doing planks with my hands in ice buckets and you know as my heart rates getting jacked up he's having me hold that and all of a sudden he's like alright get out and I'm doing a wall sit but now my feet are in the ice buckets and he puts a weight plate on top of my legs and he's like okay and then he hands me these Legos and he's like solve these Lego problems and until you don't solve this Lego and build this little like you know aircraft Lego man or whatever you know you
*  can't get your feet out of the ice bucket like what the hell is going on but he's like look you're gonna be in Antarctica your life is gonna depend on you time you know securing your tent right or tying down the ropes properly or this and that the other thing you're gonna be cold your hands are gonna be frozen you're gonna be tired but you're gonna need your mind your dexterity to be there yeah there's the there's a picture of that of Mike bringing me through that and so with the row it was super cool to come to him again and say like hey man like there's no blueprint for this like there's no blueprint for this there's no one that's done
*  a fully human powered crossing of Drake Passage before to the Antarctic Peninsula like there's some ocean rowers but this is different like how should we prepare for this and Mike it's not like he's like well I know everything about ocean rowing but that same curiosity that same growth mindset I trust his you know sort of ability to train me he's like I don't know man like let's start thinking through this and so in the gym I mean we did all sorts of creative things he brought the ice back he started putting a rowing machine on boso balls like half boso balls basically and I'd start rowing you know didn't norm a rowing motion
*  but he'd start shaking it around because basically the ocean is gonna be moving me around so much so just the rowing motion isn't gonna prepare me for the lateral movements you know the the lats the obliques you know the all the kind of side to side stability stuff then he took it one step further which is he actually shows up at my house knocks on my door at two o'clock in the morning I think he had pre-arranged it with my wife knocks on the door and he's like get up and I'm like what what's happening he's like we're going we're training right now and he gets me he's got those boso balls but now it's the middle of the night so I'm sleep deprived or I'm kind of
*  disoriented now he's got me on the boso balls and he had brought these buckets of ice water so I'm rowing this thing it's shaking around it's the middle of night and he starts throwing ice water on me and we're doing these laps yeah here I am you know getting into this the yeah you could check these out the Discovery Channel did back it says training for the Drake the impossible row episode 3 you could find it online Jamie it's on the Discovery Channel YouTube page YouTube they have a whole playlist with okay yeah so there's 14 of these videos training all the way through the whole project discovery put them
*  online they're actually doing a feature-length documentary this spring but yeah you do for rowing for the specific muscles of rowing yourself did you lift weights did you do rows did you use a rowing machine would you use yeah so the rowing machine on the boso balls that's like in the gym also a lot of deadlift was really useful and then a lot of stability stuff so Mike would have me do certain things like we'd have you know like a seated row or something like that or monothongs I thought that was the most interesting because it was going to be disabled to the waves are usually coming from any they change directions but at any given time they're coming
*  generally from one direction so you're either leaning in really hard to your left side you're leaning in really hard to your right side that's a different to the ocean rowing than just like a pure river rowing and you know he would have me basically like holding imagine like a like a like a deadlift bar and then I'd have my eyes closed I'd be holding it there and kind of an isometric motion and then he would pull the plate a light plate off one of the sides and so I'd have to stabilize and catch you know either my left side or my right side so a lot of stabilization and balance
*  stuff and then the other piece that was huge you know Mike admittedly doesn't know a lot about rowing specifically in terms of the technique of rowing and the technique of rowing is actually very specific and so a friend of mine a guy named Chris Voida from Portland I called him up and he's like this champion rower collegiate rower rowing coach and he took me out on the Willamette River in Portland in a single man like rowing skull so very different than an ocean row boat you know ocean robots a lot bigger different different waves but he taught me on the river the actual purity of the rowing
*  motion so a lot of the training and the physical aspects I'm getting stronger was with Mike and the mindset and the ice and all the things we did there but certainly the stuff that we did on the row on the river in the Willamette with Chris was was huge for me to actually understand the motion because I just like you when you're like how hard can it be just kind of push your arms you know back and forth it's a pretty complicated motion it's a full body thing it's a it's a very coordinated thing you know you're powering out of different things and certainly on river rowing you're having to
*  you know square it's called squaring the blades and you know you're taking the blades out of the water and you know turning them so they can slide across the top and get back in and glide and all that kind of stuff so there's a lot there's a lot to the motion and so it was a short period of time I didn't take my first stroke in a row boat until July in the in the in the river and then August in the ocean robot when we came together as a team for the first time to train in Scotland and then I was rowing across the Drake in December so it was a pretty short period of time to kind of learn learn about rowing and get stronger but
*  it was a fun process to dive into something completely new so all from August September October November into December did you train and row all the time um you know quite a lot but there was other things going on was writing this I was writing a book I was you know writing the book at the same yeah right in the book at the same time you know traveling doing different things but yeah I mean obviously the training was the core focus but it wasn't like I was like every day I was always doing is rowing ten hours a day or something like that there was you know other things going on I'd imagine you would need some pretty spectacular endurance to do that
*  90 minutes on the hour every 90 minutes yeah so you got 90 minutes on 90 minutes off 90 minutes on 90 minutes off strategy for doing it that way just like to not burn yourselves out too much but yeah so like I said Fionn you know has you know a lot of ocean rowing experience and from his other expeditions we kind of collectively talked about it as a team and he was just like okay you know this is what he felt has worked the best for people to you know do a long stretch get enough rest but you know obviously maybe the first day or two you think oh I could row for
*  hours at a time or something like that and you get longer stretch of rest but over time like your body really starts to wear it down and so he kind of you know felt that was the happy balance and it definitely like I mean I was delirious we were all delirious and sleep-deprived and it got weird out there for sure but I think it was the best my body actually held up pretty well and I felt like it was yeah it was a wild like the things going on in my mind the the night time like the night shift was really crazy so at the night the light nights weren't super long you got about
*  three hours of darkness every single night but that meant at least one 90-minute shift was complete darkness and so I know where you going that that part is like I mean it's weird enough to be out in this tiny little boat bobbing around in the middle of the ocean knocking back and forth but all of a sudden it gets completely dark and like you can see nothing and so waves kind of come out about a nowhere it's very very disorienting I was rowing so on my shift it was myself a guy named Jamie who's from Scotland and a guy named Cam Bellamy a South African guy who if I got funny
*  story about him he's an absolute legend so it's the three of us out there rowing on our shift and the other shift was Andrew John and Fionn and on our shift in the middle of the night I don't know how it started was on the first night so we're out there it's kind of like you've been rowing all day and then all of a sudden now you're wet and cold and it's dark like it's just like it's just like this sucks like those are those moments when you're like having your lowest moments and we you know you might make fun of me but we started singing man we just started singing out there I didn't make funny for rowing across yeah there you go you know we started singing
*  like I I think I just started belting out one day you know I was I was actually born on a hippie commune my mom played Bob Marley Redemption song throughout my entire birth there's like you know people watch my birth on my futon so I started oh pirates yes they robbed by sold I to the merchant ships were just belted out no I mean I my voice is terrible but you know it was intense I mean where anybody hate you I don't know you have to ask them I guess no no we
*  honestly it was it was a crazy social experiment we've got guys from four different countries three different continents no one knows each other super well few of them had done a project before in the past so they they know each other a bit better but in general we weren't you know it's not like it was six guys were like oh we've done a bunch of stuff together we're bros if I hang out and it really you know required some really diligent kind of human dynamics to bring it all together one of the things we came together in Scotland in August and we rode for the first time that's the first time we all met
*  each other we came together that's where our robot was we were getting it custom built and built out and then then that was the only time we saw each other in person we get on these Skype calls and stuff and then we got down to Punta Reyna so just where we staged it out of in Chile in southern Chile there that's kind of we got our robot we imported it we're getting everything going and those ten days were in preparation were some of the absolute hardest of the entire project getting to the start line right and you know there's gear everywhere we're trying
*  to figure out how it all fits like you know we're how we're gonna fit all this food in here and our personal gear and there's nowhere this we're trying to pack the boat and like you know tensions are elevated everyone's just kind of like nervous like the reality of what we're about to do is setting in and you know there was kind of some some breaking points and to credit where credit is due one of the guys named Andrew Towne absolute amazing guy he's actually a management consultant so he's like a lawyer businessman management consultant and he's like he's like facilitates all these conversations in his work and he sits us down he goes hey guys like we need
*  to have like a real conversation about like teamwork and what's going on because there's six of us in this tiny little boat life on the lines we come from different cultures different backgrounds different things like let's set some intentions and you know at first I think we're all maybe a little bit skeptical but he sits us down and we have this conversation about like you know let's talk let's talk let's talk real like what are our real fears going into this like what are our vulnerabilities what are our weaknesses how can we trust one another and you know we all were very honest with one another and I think it really set the tone for the entire thing one of the guys
*  is the school principal he's got a two-year-old daughter at home and he's like hey guys like I want to do this like I want to be a part of this project but like here's some of my fears you know and for me I'm like look like we got to have a communication we got to be able to say to each other for having a bad day we got to just be honest like hey I'm not having a good day but it's not because like I'm a bad person you know we got to support one another and really having that facilitated conversation as a team early on before we're out in the water in the intensity I think carried us through and I'm so so so grateful that Andrew facilitated that conversation because that was a really turning point in the group dynamics and
*  so the discovery channel was their idea for this thing no come to you guys yeah so that the whole discovery thing is is really cool part of this so basically what happens Fionn Fionn had the idea for this you know legendary you know ocean rower and but the component parts of pulling it all together really complicated one of the reasons is because the an hour so say you owned a yacht or something like that and you're like you know what Colin I want to take my yacht to Antarctica like that's not really something that you
*  can just do there's a whole bunch of environmental protections and laws and things like that there's like specific boats that have like permating that's called this called the Iado treaty and it's basically what governs like tourism in Antarctica and the reason they do that is because of sort of environmental concerns in Antarctica and so really good thing but turns out like my ocean rowboat is not like part of like the full treaty of Antarctica and so the only way to do it and be like well within the rules and like above board within everything that's going on in Antarctica all the environmental protection is to have one of the Iado
*  certified boats there and a part of this and so what we realize is we needed what was called a supervising vessel not a vessel that would you know give us support in the middle and hang out with us we could jump off and take a hot shower but a boat that's basically overseeing the totality of the project and also has like us being like fully permitted throughout that and so we're like okay like that's interesting there's going to be this other boat out there we got to figure out who this is it's super expensive we got to raise the money to make sure we can have that you know all these types of things the only way it can work we kind of got set to work on doing that
*  myself my wife Jenna she builds these projects with me Blake who works with me and a bunch of people kind of working on kind of details of it and we quickly realized like wow what an amazing opportunity if we have this other boat out there we can film this thing and I've wanted to film my projects on my projects and share them really widely before but when you're walking across Antarctica dragging a 375 pound sled and the whole purpose of the goal is to be so it's not like you can have like a cameraman just like hanging out there like shooting you you know I mean although there's just a road so there's just people hanging out there
*  LOL LOL but basically that's when we said hey like let's see if someone will be interested in coming on as a media partner of this and really filming this and sharing this in a big in a big way and so we got to talking with discovery they got on board of it and it was a really cool vision it was kind of a combined vision of theirs and ours through all my other projects I mentioned the GPS through my last you know Antarctica crossing and my other previous world records before I always carry this GPS and share it in real time I have this nonprofit where
*  you know during the road there were 600,000 school kids and school curriculums we built around like ocean and environmental learning and stuff like that all incorporated into the kind of daily following along with the science and curriculum so I always want to share the projects in real time and so we talked to discovery and they're like this is super cool let's do three different things at once here so we invest in all the satellite technology with iridium the iridium satellites and they were able to basically allow us to do social media during the time so if you're like sitting at home on Christmas Day as we're arriving in Antarctica like you watching me bouncing around on
*  this you know rowboat you can follow the whole thing and then who's doing this the other boat so I yeah they have the satellites on the other boat but we have I'm shooting the social media content on my boat is powered how it's a proper it's like a norm it's like a hundred and
*  twenty foot like boat with like a proper engine and that's nice that they were with you yes so yeah shit goes side absolutely absolutely so definitely had that as the they they never didn't tell them to carry the food because so the unsupported part of the project like means the
*  second we launched like they couldn't touch it if they touched us in you know it's catastrophic it's over if that's the end of the thing and so my wife my wife was on board that she runs all the brush projects for me in the background names that she was actually so she
*  crossed the Drake in this larger boat which by for Drake passage standards is still a much smaller boat there's six guys you know who were five guys who ran the boat and then five guys on the discovery film crew but they rigged our ocean rowboat up with all these go pros and batteries and all this kind of stuff so we were completely
*  self-sufficient on the boat itself and just had to like switch out memory cards and stuff for self but what ended up happening is there was a social media component happening live and then what Jamie just pulled up in the video of me training there's these 14 episodes on discovery go that are online right now and they're all like five to ten minutes long that kind of tell the story in mid form episodes which is cool because that was coming out concurrently so while we're out there they're putting these pieces of content sent out by the satellites that people could see and then this spring a couple months from now they're gonna have a long form documentary that comes out and they're gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna
*  be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah
*  That's awesome. It's just a crazy thing that you've done and it begs the question. When you do crazy things like does this change you as a person? Does like you walk across Antarctica's one, rowing across the Drake stretch as it was called, the Drake Passage is another. Like is this changing you as a person? Like what are these, because these are experiences, if you told someone hey you're gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like oh yeah I'm
*  gonna be like oh yeah I'm gonna be like I'm gonna be like wow man this is crazy, this is
*  crazy
*  yeah
*  I'm totally going to change my way of navigating the life style. Like you're going to sleep 90
*  minutes
*  at a clip and then you're going to row for 90 minutes and you're going to poop into a
*  bucket and you're going to sleep like a sardine with a bunch of other dudes on this boat, you're
*  not going to sleep much, you're probably going to hallucinate, sometimes you're going to row
*  Your personal life experiences are so much more extreme than the average person's.
*  Yeah, 100%.
*  I mean, you know, one of my reasons for doing this for sure is to test the limits of my
*  own potential and grow.
*  I'm not doing them just to like, so that I can be the exact same person on the other
*  side of Antarctica, the other side of Drake Passage.
*  It's to take that learning and you know, I've been asked a similar question, I guess before,
*  but my answer or the way that I kind of think about it is I've started to think about life
*  like the, I mean, I've started to think about life and the totality of life experience between
*  like say a numerical one and ten.
*  Like one being the worst day of your life and ten being the best day of your life.
*  And you know, one might be, you know, a day that if a family member passes away or one
*  might be being wet and cold and freezing in an ocean rowboat, you know, spooning with
*  this other guy and you know, been shitting in a bucket and being exhausted and tired,
*  you know, like just like rough moments in your life, right?
*  And ten is this hedonistic joy, the most pleasure-filled day ever, just happy, joyful,
*  maybe you've succeeded in something you've accomplished, like all this kind of stuff.
*  And as I've kind of looked around at the world, people say, what are you afraid of?
*  You must not be afraid of being alone or you must not be afraid of, you know, these hard
*  challenges and stuff like that.
*  I'm like, well, maybe not, but what I'm really afraid of is actually living a life range-bound
*  between four and six.
*  I think too often people, you know, the typical life experience, unfortunately, because we
*  have some creas or comforts, particularly in the Western world, where, you know, you
*  can live a life and you're stuck between four and six.
*  So maybe the happiest day of your year or your week, it's like the Super Bowl and your
*  team wins the Super Bowl and you crush a couple beers with your buddy and you high-five him.
*  You're like, oh, that was awesome.
*  Like, that was cool.
*  But it's not ten.
*  I mean, it's a six.
*  And then like maybe the worst day of your week, it's like a Monday and your boss yells
*  at you or something like that.
*  And you're just like, you're like, oh, man, like that's kind of bummer.
*  But you know what?
*  I don't really give a shit about my job anyway.
*  So like, I'm not really that bummed about it.
*  I'm just kind of like in this life of like quiet desperation in the middle.
*  And I think a lot of that has to do with because we're hedging or afraid of the ones.
*  We're just like, I don't want to experience a one.
*  I don't want to experience discomfort.
*  I don't want to experience pain, like anything to do that.
*  But what I've realized, I think of it like kind of a pendulum, like swinging the totality
*  of life experience, like to get to the tens, you also need to embrace the ones, like the
*  totality of life in the experience.
*  I'm not experiencing these high highs or these hedonistic joys or these beautiful flow states
*  or things like that, you know, in spite of the ones, in spite of the challenge, but it's
*  because of them.
*  By pulling my sled, you know, 53 days on my 53rd day of pulling my sled across Antarctica,
*  I get there, my hips are poking out, my ribs are sticking out.
*  I'm exhausted.
*  I can barely pick my duffel bag up to put it in my sled.
*  My body is completely compromised.
*  I'm exhausted.
*  But then I tap into the deepest flow state of my entire life.
*  I find this place in my mind, in my body, in my soul, and, you know, I pushed 32 hours
*  without stopping to the finish line, and I wouldn't have gotten there had I not pushed
*  myself, had I not, you know, gone through this difficulty.
*  You know, I like to say that, you know, pain is mandatory.
*  These challenges are painful.
*  Straight up, pain is mandatory.
*  Make no mistake about this.
*  The obvious things I'm doing are painful.
*  They're hard, whatever.
*  But the suffering part is optional.
*  Yeah.
*  You don't have to be in these moments so wanting to be like, oh my god, this is horrible.
*  I'm in this.
*  And why did I get myself out there?
*  This is terrible.
*  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and go down this path.
*  You're like, I'm doing this because when I step outside of my comfort zone, I grow.
*  And as I grow, I can share that with other people and hopefully have that ripple effect
*  of positivity and inspiration that's lasting in the world for others as well.
*  Yeah.
*  You mentioned one of my favorite quotes ever, the Thoreau quote, most men live lives of
*  quiet desperation.
*  I love that.
*  Yeah.
*  That's a great fucking quote and so damn true.
*  I think you're right.
*  I think you really need very difficult things in your life in order to appreciate real comfort
*  and relaxation.
*  Absolutely.
*  I don't think you hit it if your whole life is just soft cushions and everything's made
*  out of velour and people are feeding you grapes.
*  I think you live like an asshole.
*  I think we don't like that because no one really, suffering is hard.
*  It's hard.
*  It feels uncomfortable.
*  But you don't realize that unless you suffer, you don't appreciate calm.
*  You don't appreciate peace.
*  I think there's just far too many people out there seeking comfort.
*  I agree with that.
*  And I think that it's funny because people are going towards that they're hedging against
*  discomfort like, okay, how to make this as comfortable as possible.
*  And then they sit there and they're like, why am I unsatisfied?
*  Why am I not happy?
*  And it's like, because you're hedging against discomfort because you're trying to make,
*  like you said, it's poor education, really.
*  People are not educated on what it takes in order to be fulfilled in life.
*  The idea is that material possessions or some modicum of success is the goal.
*  It's not.
*  Difficult tasks is what make you do something that's hard to do.
*  Do something that's interesting.
*  Do something that's complicated and intricate.
*  Do something that requires you to stretch your boundaries.
*  Absolutely.
*  That's why I'm asking you because you're stretching your boundaries into some weird life, death-defying
*  sort of thing.
*  You've done two of these so far.
*  What is next?
*  Are you going to do ultra marathons?
*  Are you going to try to climb mountains?
*  What are you going to do?
*  I know you've got something going on.
*  I did a big mountaineering project before any of this.
*  For these last two projects, I did something called the Explorers Grand Slam.
*  So I climbed the tallest mountain on each of the seven continents and went to the north
*  and south pole for the last degree of latitude, faster than anyone's done that.
*  So I was 139 days back in 2016.
*  So Everest, Inala, Kilimanjaro, et cetera, back to back.
*  The next actual physical project that I have, it's not some world record.
*  But my wife, one of the things that we do, we have this nonprofit, as I mentioned, and
*  love speaking to young people, kind of opening their minds to the outdoors and being stewards
*  of the land and really inspiring young people to think about doing hard things and testing
*  themselves.
*  It doesn't have to be in the outdoors at all.
*  It could be anything, music, art, culture, whatever it is, but to aim high in their life.
*  And one question we started asking young people was this question, which is, what's your Everest?
*  It's a really obvious metaphor for kids.
*  It's like, what's your big goal?
*  What is your Everest?
*  And kids are amazing.
*  In a gymnasium, I get kids raising their hand going, my Everest would be the first person
*  in my family to graduate from college or whatever amazing things kids dream of and help facilitate
*  them towards those goals.
*  But about a year ago now, my wife, who didn't grow up climbing mountains, didn't grow up
*  as an avid athlete or anything, she's been wildly supportive of the work we've done.
*  A lot of the book is really about our love story and building these projects together.
*  And so we are going back in April.
*  I've climbed Mount Everest once before from the Nepalese side, but we're going to go back
*  and climb Everest.
*  We'll be there in April, May of this year, so in a couple of months to climb Mount Everest
*  from the north side.
*  And really for me, that's to be a support, a facilitator of her goals.
*  So the next thing I'm doing kind of in the athletic or outdoor space is actually to support
*  Jenna in climbing, literally her Mount Everest, being Mount Everest.
*  And it's really cool to see her, you know, just someone so close to me, commit to a goal.
*  It's an audacious goal for her, for her back.
*  I mean, she's amazing.
*  She's strong.
*  She's fit.
*  She's trained.
*  She's ready.
*  But like just like six months ago, I never rode a boat, you know, a year ago.
*  Yeah, she's climbed some big mountains, but to say, hey, I want to climb Mount Everest
*  was a massive goal for her.
*  Do you think you're going to do stuff together, like do some death defying thing together?
*  Are you going to get her addicted to this shit now?
*  You know, I think we'll see.
*  I think for her, this, this, I don't want to say it's one and done, but I'm sure that,
*  you know, I don't think she has the huge desire to keep doing these types of things.
*  I think the next journey for both of us probably after that is a parenthood, having kids.
*  Yeah, that's, that's a whole other journey.
*  Everest seems very commercialized now, right?
*  I watched some of the footage of the from the pictures and stuff like that, the giant
*  line of people trying to summit.
*  It's a weird thing now.
*  Yeah.
*  So that's from the south side.
*  That's the side that I climbed in 2016 from Nepal.
*  That was that photograph was taken from that.
*  What a wild and bizarre thing that was, say the least.
*  Traffic jam.
*  Yeah.
*  So on the north side, there's less crowds.
*  What were we climbing from?
*  But also that day, I mean, look, that I don't have the answer to the problem.
*  That certainly was a problematic thing that happened up there.
*  It's kind of a weird, perfect storm a little bit where it was actually really stormy for
*  a while and then people got delayed and the ropes were delayed getting in.
*  And then all of a sudden there's one good day and everyone goes at the same time.
*  So again, I don't know what the solution is, but everyone going up at the same time on
*  the same day on one day in May is obviously clearly based on that picture.
*  Like not the answer.
*  Did anybody die that day?
*  Yeah, people did die that day.
*  I don't know the exact count, but people did die that day because they got stuck out there
*  and couldn't move one way or the other.
*  When I was climbing in 2016, it was actually a somewhat crowded day.
*  Nothing like that photo, but it was a more crowded day.
*  And I was climbing with a Sherpa by the name of Pasang Bodhi, incredibly strong guy.
*  We summited together.
*  It was his seventh time on the summit, just an absolute legend.
*  And him and I talked about it and we were behind all these people and we actually made
*  the decision.
*  You know, we taught, he said, you know, we got a way that kind of pros and cons here.
*  If we stay behind people, you're moving as slow as the slowest person in this line.
*  And it's just like you've seen those photos.
*  It's just not a great situation.
*  It's cold, you can get frostbite and all that kind of stuff.
*  And so we actually made the choice to unclip from the ropes, the fixed rope there on the
*  first half of the summit day, all the way up to a section called the balcony.
*  We actually climbed unroped, but beside the people, because we actually made the call
*  that we said, you know, actually climbing unroped of this section felt safer, you know,
*  risking a slip or a bad fall with no ropes felt safer than being stuck behind some other
*  people.
*  And then eventually it did get too stape and too falling off.
*  Yeah, that's the photo that NimsDai took.
*  That's a crazy picture.
*  I never saw anything like that.
*  And that's, I mean, that's definitely the exception, not the rule on Everest.
*  But the fact that exists is just horrible.
*  I mean, there's a horrible, you know, there's nothing good to say about that other than
*  it's just, it's tragic for sure.
*  So you know, I think that, again, I don't know what the solution is.
*  I'm proud of Jennifer setting this goal.
*  And you know, I think that people should, you know, set that goal.
*  I think people, if that's what they want to do, great.
*  If they want to climb mountains, if they want to do anything, they don't want to stop
*  people from doing that.
*  But certainly a situation like that where people are stuck on ropes and dying in a situation
*  where that shouldn't happen like that is a terrible thing.
*  So this book, The Impossible First, it's out now.
*  People can go get it, right?
*  Yep.
*  It's out now.
*  It came out a month ago.
*  Are you going to write a book about your rowboat experience as well?
*  Do you think I should?
*  Why not?
*  Fuck it.
*  The book, it's also an audio book.
*  So if you don't like reading and you like listening instead, you got the audio book.
*  I narrated it myself.
*  That's good.
*  Yeah, I narrated it myself.
*  It's out.
*  It came out a month ago.
*  Just hit the New York Times bestsellers list.
*  So beautiful.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, congratulations.
*  Don't die.
*  We'll come back again next time we do something else crazy.
*  Yeah, you got it, man.
*  You happy to talk to you about it?
*  Good?
*  No?
*  Jamie looked over at me like something was going on.
*  So The Impossible First, it's out right now.
*  Go get it, folks.
*  Thanks, Colin.
*  Appreciate it.
*  Thanks very much, man.
*  Thank you.
*  That's great.
*  That's real.
