**Joe Rogan Experience:** [June 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=0.0s)]
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day! [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6.0s)]

*  Good. War time. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=14.0s)]
*  King of Miami, what's up? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=16.0s)]
*  What's up, my brother? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=18.0s)]
*  Good to see you, man. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=19.0s)]
*  Always a fucking pleasure. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=20.0s)]
*  Always a pleasure to see you too, man. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=21.0s)]
*  Bro, I've been a fan of yours since back in the day. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=23.0s)]
*  Strike force, easy. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=25.0s)]
*  What's up? So you fought a...Bowdog? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=26.0s)]
*  Bowdog. Snap. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=28.0s)]
*  So you fought Eve Edwards on Bowdog. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=29.0s)]
*  Yes, I did. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=31.0s)]
*  I'm like, damn, this dude's fucking dangerous. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=32.0s)]
*  Yes, I did, man. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=33.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're still in the game, man. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=34.0s)]
*  It's beautiful to see, you know? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=36.0s)]
*  Crafty veterans. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=39.0s)]
*  Yeah, man. I attribute a lot to God with the gifts that I was born [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=40.0s)]
*  and also the training that I do. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=45.0s)]
*  I never get too far away from the training. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=47.0s)]
*  And another thing is that I've kept it natural for the most part. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=50.0s)]
*  I've seen a lot of guys come in four or five years. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=53.0s)]
*  They do a little bit of the enhancements and cheating [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=56.0s)]
*  and then tear this, break that. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=58.0s)]
*  So these guys ain't around no more. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=60.0s)]
*  I just feel like I couldn't afford it when I was coming up into that stuff. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=61.0s)]
*  So I just never did it, you know? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=66.0s)]
*  So I've always kept my body more or less healthy. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=67.0s)]
*  I've had injuries that are horrible, obviously, in combat sports, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=70.0s)]
*  but I've always just been able to heal through them. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=73.0s)]
*  And one thing I've always believed in for the sport, for anybody listening, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=76.0s)]
*  wanting to get into the sport and have longevity, is like, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=80.0s)]
*  as long as you know that every day you can learn something new from whoever it may be, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=82.0s)]
*  you'll always be going forward. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=86.0s)]
*  The moment you think you know it all, that's it, bro. You're fucked up. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=88.0s)]
*  So I've always had that mentality since I was young, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=91.0s)]
*  and I still have it to this day. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=94.0s)]
*  A white belt could teach me something or a setup or something. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=95.0s)]
*  Not necessarily maybe the greatest technique, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=98.0s)]
*  but just a different way to do a technique, and I might be able to pull it off. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=100.0s)]
*  So I've always stuck firm to that commitment. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=103.0s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. That's very important, to have that beginner's mentality. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=106.0s)]
*  What is the worst injury you've ever had? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=110.0s)]
*  Like, pain-wise, eye poke. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=114.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=117.0s)]
*  I shot like a high crotch, and the guy's elbow was like resting on his hip, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=118.0s)]
*  and he just like locked out, and it went right into my thumb. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=123.0s)]
*  His thumb went right into my eye, and I was throwing up immediately. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=127.0s)]
*  Like, 10 seconds after, I started throwing up, and I couldn't, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=131.0s)]
*  I was doing like the Harlem Shake. I couldn't control my body. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=135.0s)]
*  I was just shaking and throwing up. It was so much pain. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=137.0s)]
*  After that, I had to wear an eye patch for about like five weeks, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=140.0s)]
*  because I had double vision. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=143.0s)]
*  So I would like look at you and see like two, three of you, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=144.0s)]
*  and that would last for like five weeks. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=146.0s)]
*  So I was supposed to have surgery on it, and they scheduled me for surgery. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=148.0s)]
*  I came back in, and the doctor's like, hey, man, maybe you don't need surgery. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=152.0s)]
*  You did amazing healing. Like, sweating's gone down a little bit. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=156.0s)]
*  You kind of don't need the surgery. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=159.0s)]
*  So I was like, oh, let me not get the surgery, and I wore the eye patch for five weeks. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=160.0s)]
*  That was the most painful injury of my life. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=163.0s)]
*  The other ones have just been like long-lasting injuries. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=166.0s)]
*  Like, my hand is all fucking wrecked, you know. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=169.0s)]
*  Back's pretty messed up, but I get through it, you know. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=172.0s)]
*  Cold, plunge, sauna, a lot of stretching, things like that. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=175.0s)]
*  Like, I could work through it, but the eye and the hand have been the worst, probably. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=178.0s)]
*  Did you break the hand? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=182.0s)]
*  No, but I've torn like numerous ligaments and tendons on the hand, you know. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=183.0s)]
*  That's why my fingers look like they're throwing up gang signs. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=187.0s)]
*  They're all crooked and stuff, you know. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=189.0s)]
*  But yeah, that's been like one of the more lagging ones. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=191.0s)]
*  In the knees and stuff, you know how it's sported. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=194.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=196.0s)]
*  Pulling on your joints, meniscus there, here, ACL there. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=197.0s)]
*  But those, I've been able to rehab and work through them. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=199.0s)]
*  They suck like when I'm running on like on a cold day. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=201.0s)]
*  But it's nothing that I can't work through. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=204.0s)]
*  The hand is like sometimes I got to just give it a pause. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=205.0s)]
*  Like, a week I can't throw my right hand. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=208.0s)]
*  I just got to use my left and stuff like that. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=209.0s)]
*  I remember when you got a meniscus injury, and I was worried about that. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=211.0s)]
*  But you just rehabbed it? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=215.0s)]
*  Just rehabbed, man. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=216.0s)]
*  I don't really like surgery, you know. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=217.0s)]
*  And I've talked to a lot of other athletes that did do like the meniscus repair, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=221.0s)]
*  and then it tore again, and then they were out for like six months. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=225.0s)]
*  I was like, nah, it's not going to be me. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=228.0s)]
*  So I've always focused on like rehab, get whoever's the best rehab person around [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=229.0s)]
*  at that time that I could find for that particular injury, and just get to work. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=234.0s)]
*  And if after some time I'm not seeing any gains, then maybe I'll try some other stuff. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=237.0s)]
*  And there's so many advances in the medical field, not like the STEM. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=242.0s)]
*  So that's helped me out tremendously with my knees, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=245.0s)]
*  giving me a full range of motion to be able to like squat all the way down. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=247.0s)]
*  I was having trouble like breaking parallel once I'd have a little bit of weight on my back. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=250.0s)]
*  I just feel crazy tension on my knees. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=254.0s)]
*  Since the stem cell, I got like a full range of motion back on my knees, you know. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=256.0s)]
*  That's beautiful. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=259.0s)]
*  The hand as well. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=260.0s)]
*  Where did you go to get the stem cells? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=261.0s)]
*  The UFC sent me up for my hand. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=263.0s)]
*  I went to California, and it was freaking amazing. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=265.0s)]
*  It was right after the Nate Diaz fight. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=270.0s)]
*  Both my hands were jacked, and one of the blows that I hit Nate with, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=272.0s)]
*  I hit him in the top of the head, and you can see it on the video. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=276.0s)]
*  My hand folds. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=278.0s)]
*  I just kind of had like shitty technique for that one punch. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=279.0s)]
*  And I couldn't even wipe my ass. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=282.0s)]
*  I swear to you, bro. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=284.0s)]
*  The pain that I had, I couldn't bend it in like that. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=285.0s)]
*  I did the stem cells. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=288.0s)]
*  Three weeks later, I was like, holy smokes, this is insane. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=289.0s)]
*  And in my knees and hands, I did it down in Columbia. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=292.0s)]
*  I bioaccelerated. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=296.0s)]
*  That was freaking a great time, too. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=297.0s)]
*  That's the way to go. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=298.0s)]
*  When you go to those other countries, whether it's Panama or Colombia, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=299.0s)]
*  or they do it in Tijuana now, too, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=304.0s)]
*  it's like they can do shit that you can't do in America. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=306.0s)]
*  They just load you up. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=308.0s)]
*  You get the full spectrum over there. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=309.0s)]
*  Yeah, and you just fucking heals everything. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=311.0s)]
*  It's incredible. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=313.0s)]
*  It's great for stuff that you don't even know is wrong. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=314.0s)]
*  It's great for just overall longevity and body healing. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=316.0s)]
*  I haven't done them because you know how you saw it with us, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=319.0s)]
*  but I've heard about the IV stem cells as well that are freaking great for you as well. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=322.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's incredible. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=326.0s)]
*  It sucks that the IV thing is an issue. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=327.0s)]
*  But you know, it's a... [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=330.0s)]
*  I mean, you don't cut a ton of weight. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=333.0s)]
*  You used to fight at 55 and at 70. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=335.0s)]
*  Yeah, 55, I was a ton of weight, a ton of water weight because my body fat... [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=337.0s)]
*  I lived a different life there, a very strict diet. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=342.0s)]
*  Once I turned like 25, 26, I had to have proper notice, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=344.0s)]
*  like nine weeks notice to get myself in shape, to come in and fight weak. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=349.0s)]
*  I had like 174 to drop down to 156. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=353.0s)]
*  And right around like 172, 173, I was 5% body fat already. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=356.0s)]
*  So it was just straight water and it was fucking torturous. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=361.0s)]
*  And then you saw that when I decided to move up, you saw that came in the game and outlawed the IVs for us, right? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=364.0s)]
*  So I was like, there's no way I can make 155. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=369.0s)]
*  And that's when I made my move to 70. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=371.0s)]
*  But it's been phenomenal for you at 70. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=373.0s)]
*  I think you're better at 70. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=376.0s)]
*  I really think you're just stronger, healthier. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=377.0s)]
*  I didn't have the pop at 155 after I turned 26, 27, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=380.0s)]
*  which usually a man loses his strength and power at the end of his career, you know. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=384.0s)]
*  And it was like a month before the fight, I'd be hurting people and sparring. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=389.0s)]
*  As I got nearer to the fight, I just I didn't have that electricity that pop pop, you know. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=393.0s)]
*  So I really started to like, man, fuck, you know, it's something I'm going to have to do. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=398.0s)]
*  And it was in the back of my mind. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=402.0s)]
*  But I would always work out with 70 pounders and like 45 pounders at American Top Team. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=403.0s)]
*  We had a lot of sand as I won 55. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=408.0s)]
*  So I would work out with them as well. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=410.0s)]
*  But I was like, we might have to cross paths. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=411.0s)]
*  So I didn't make it like my main staple to work out with those guys. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=413.0s)]
*  So I knew that there was a strength level difference at me at 170. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=416.0s)]
*  But I knew I could hurt those guys when I touch them, you know, every time. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=419.0s)]
*  So I knew if I could work on my strength gains and get a little size, I'd be all right at 70. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=423.0s)]
*  Oh, well, look at the dare and till knockout. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=428.0s)]
*  Yes, sir. That was fucking phenomenal. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=430.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I wonder how many fighters are cutting their career short by dehydrating the shit out of themselves. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=433.0s)]
*  It's rough. You know, when you're young, you get away with it always. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=439.0s)]
*  Your body, you could get run over by a truck and you wake up the next day. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=442.0s)]
*  But there comes a point where you kind of just lose that, you know. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=445.0s)]
*  And I don't care how young you are, your chin, once you cut over like 12, 13, 14 pounds of water, your chin and legs take a massive hit, I feel. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=448.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's why I'm amazed that Pahira, who walks around like 40 pounds heavier than 185. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=456.0s)]
*  He's fucking huge. Yeah. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=464.0s)]
*  But usually the big boys also could have more water to release, you know, the 205ers, the 85ers, the heavyweights. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=466.0s)]
*  But yeah, that guy's massive. I've seen pictures of him off season. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=472.0s)]
*  I'm like, holy smokes. He looks like a fucking small heavyweight at times. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=474.0s)]
*  When he gets into the octagon at 185, you can't believe he ever weighed 185. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=477.0s)]
*  He's so fucking big. It's a giant advantage. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=481.0s)]
*  But I wonder how long he could do that. He's like 34 now. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=484.0s)]
*  I wonder how long his body's going to allow him to dehydrate the shit out of himself like that. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=487.0s)]
*  It catches up, I think. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=493.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, he's already talked about going to 205. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=494.0s)]
*  Nice. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=497.0s)]
*  So you got a big fight coming up. You're mid-camp. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=498.0s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=500.0s)]
*  Thanks for coming down, man. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=501.0s)]
*  Hell yeah, bro. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=502.0s)]
*  So Gilbert, that's a good fight. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=503.0s)]
*  It's a great fight, man. I think wrestling is not that good, so I know I could negate him on the wrestling takedowns and just keep a stand up. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=505.0s)]
*  And stand up, he makes a lot of mistakes constantly. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=515.0s)]
*  I feel, you know, just looking at it from a striker's point of view, I feel he's tailor-made for me to give my fucking left hook to the jaw and end this night, you know? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=518.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, it's an exciting fight, and Gilbert's a fucking dangerous man. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=527.0s)]
*  And it's the co-main event in Miami. It's going to be wild. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=532.0s)]
*  20 years ain't been in Miami. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=536.0s)]
*  Woo! That's going to be wild. Just the moment when you get into that fucking octagon, the pop that you get, it's going to be insane. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=538.0s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=544.0s)]
*  In Miami? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=545.0s)]
*  In Miami. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=546.0s)]
*  Woo! [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=547.0s)]
*  And forever, the road has been my home, so I've always felt comfortable. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=548.0s)]
*  Like, okay, we're going to fight Abu Dhabi, fight Ireland, cool. We're going to fight California, Texas, cool. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=553.0s)]
*  I've always felt great. So definitely it's going to be like a little bit more added pressure, a little different being in my actual home, you know? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=559.0s)]
*  But you're going to wake up in your own bed. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=566.0s)]
*  I'm going to wake up in my own bed. That is true. I'm going to take a drive from my house to the arena in my car. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=567.0s)]
*  It's all going to be like if I'm going to sparring, but a little bit more added chips to it, you know? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=572.0s)]
*  For sure. For sure. Yeah, it's an exciting time for the welterweight division, too. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=578.0s)]
*  You know, with you having that beef with Leon, and Leon now having retained the title, and they're talking about Colby, but I feel like with a good showing against Gilbert, you skip the line. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=583.0s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=596.0s)]
*  Yeah, it becomes... [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=597.0s)]
*  And Leon wants it, you know, more than anything. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=598.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=599.0s)]
*  He wants it more than anything, just for the history that we have, and also we're going to sell the most pay-per-views if me and him are in that cage. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=600.0s)]
*  It'll sell a lot. It'll sell a lot. It'll be a big fight. It's going to be a gigantic fight. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=606.0s)]
*  What did you think about the rematch, the rubber fight with Leon and Camaro? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=612.0s)]
*  A little lackluster, you know? And Usman, maybe like there was times where I didn't see him stepping on the gas like he usually does, you know? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=616.0s)]
*  And it might have been because he just took this fight too early. I always think that when a fighter gets knocked out, you really... [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=626.0s)]
*  You know, and I got this from the old timers in boxing, you need to really let your brain and your confidence heal and come back, you know? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=632.0s)]
*  Because then you get back in and you get touched and you're like, whoa, I might get knocked out and you pull the brakes and you start like, you know, maybe second guessing yourself. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=638.0s)]
*  So I think maybe he took it a little bit too early, you know? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=646.0s)]
*  I do think that he's in a way better fighter than Leon in a lot of aspects, but Leon just has his number, it seems right now. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=648.0s)]
*  Well, Leon was also super confident coming into that fight. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=656.0s)]
*  I feel like once a guy becomes the champion, they gain confidence and they gain ability because they just have this understanding of what they're capable of doing. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=659.0s)]
*  And the fact that it was in England, it was... [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=670.0s)]
*  And he had the title and he knocked them out. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=674.0s)]
*  Yeah, all the above. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=676.0s)]
*  A lot of factors. You just don't know how a guy is going to come back after his first KO loss. And it was a battle, it was a brutal one. Usman was down for a bit. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=678.0s)]
*  How long after the Camaro fight did you take off? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=685.0s)]
*  Close to like eight to nine months, maybe even longer. All my coaches wanted me. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=688.0s)]
*  Plus, it was like the first KO of my career. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=693.0s)]
*  So more so on like, not my body was already healed, my brain, but they wanted to make sure that my mind was right. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=697.0s)]
*  Yeah. How long did it take you to get over it? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=703.0s)]
*  I still haven't got over it, brother. I want to fucking rip Usman's fucking brains out. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=706.0s)]
*  Nothing personal, I just want to get back in there and do it to him. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=712.0s)]
*  I've never been knocked down. I've fought in a lot. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=715.0s)]
*  We were talking about earlier, Eves Edwards, I've fought great strikers. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=718.0s)]
*  They never even came close to knocking me out. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=722.0s)]
*  And it's not that this Usman, but I don't put him in the league of one of these great strikers. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=725.0s)]
*  He's a great fighter because he can do a lot of things well. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=729.0s)]
*  But after fighting him the first time and getting his best shots and I cut 20 pounds of water and I took the fight in six day notice. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=731.0s)]
*  And I went to Abu Dhabi, I was like, bro, this guy will never hurt me. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=738.0s)]
*  He hits like a bitch and then all of a sudden he's the dude that knocks me out. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=741.0s)]
*  I had five rounds with him. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=744.0s)]
*  So in that, I think it was nine months since the first fight that he gained that type of power was just nuts to me. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=746.0s)]
*  It was like unreal, unnatural, because I felt his fucking best punches in the first fight for five rounds and never hurt me. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=753.0s)]
*  Never shook me up good. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=760.0s)]
*  And then boom, surprise hit in the second fight. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=762.0s)]
*  So do you think it was a matter of you not respecting his power and on top of that him just getting better? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=766.0s)]
*  I always respect anybody who has two hands and two feet. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=774.0s)]
*  So it's not like I'm trying to do like touch me in the chin and give a shot to take a shot. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=777.0s)]
*  Definitely caught me by surprise when he started the load up. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=782.0s)]
*  I kind of saw like the back of his head. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=785.0s)]
*  So I thought for sure he's going to shoot. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=787.0s)]
*  So I started to like drop my hands and I noticed like midway. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=788.0s)]
*  Oh, it's a right hand. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=791.0s)]
*  I tried to check hook him, but it's too late already that the right hand already penetrated the force field and took my ass out. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=792.0s)]
*  You know, yeah, it's a it's a moment that happens to many fighters and it defines who they are, how they bounce back from. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=798.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know, I'm coming. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=807.0s)]
*  I'm coming strong, man. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=809.0s)]
*  I feel my mind after that fight, maybe I'm not going to lie. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=810.0s)]
*  I went into like a dark place for a while, because like I said, I never been knocked out. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=816.0s)]
*  It was just fucking nuts to me like, bro, this guy's the one that fucking literally knocked me out. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=820.0s)]
*  Like I was out cold. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=825.0s)]
*  It wasn't like a like you stopped it early. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=826.0s)]
*  Nothing. I know in my heart of hearts, this guy fucking knocked me out. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=828.0s)]
*  And for me to think Usman is the one that knocked me out, I never would have betted that this guy would knock me out. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=831.0s)]
*  So it affected me, bro. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=835.0s)]
*  Bad, you know what I'm saying? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=838.0s)]
*  Do you ever go to a sports psychologist? [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=839.0s)]
*  I just listen to Jordan Peterson on YouTube, man. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=842.0s)]
*  That's my dude right there for many, many years. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=846.0s)]
*  I've never met him. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=848.0s)]
*  I haven't got the chance, but I'm actually by coincidence, he's in Florida, April 9th. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=849.0s)]
*  And I'm like doing everything in my power to make sure that I'm there. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=855.0s)]
*  Like right after my fight, I'm going to go. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=859.0s)]
*  He's going to have a conference down in. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=861.0s)]
*  I'll connect you guys. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=862.0s)]
*  Oh, hell yeah. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=863.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'll connect you guys. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=864.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=865.0s)]
*  For sure. He's going to be in Florida. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=866.0s)]
*  So I was like, bro, I got to go. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=867.0s)]
*  I just want to sit in the crowd and listen to this dude. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=868.0s)]
*  I've been listening to him for years on YouTube and stuff. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=870.0s)]
*  And I listened to a lot of motivational speakers and stuff. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=872.0s)]
*  Sports psychologist. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=875.0s)]
*  Sports psychologist. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=876.0s)]
*  I've never really seen one personally, but I'm sure it would help. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=877.0s)]
*  Yeah, it certainly can help. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=880.0s)]
*  But Jordan is essentially giving you sports psychologist. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=883.0s)]
*  He's giving you life lessons. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=886.0s)]
*  And not just sports. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=888.0s)]
*  I think for me, I have a lot of bad habits that I had from growing up. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=889.0s)]
*  And the way that I did that I took into the pro world and I was still succeeding. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=896.0s)]
*  Let's say I stayed up all night for whatever reason was I was either chasing money or chasing shit. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=900.0s)]
*  And then I went to sleep at 4 a.m. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=905.0s)]
*  And I woke up at 9 a.m. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=907.0s)]
*  And I went to the gym at 10 and I beat everybody's ass in that room. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=908.0s)]
*  And I'm like, I don't have to change nothing. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=911.0s)]
*  And I went on to beat numerous good guys, challenged for world titles outside of the UFC. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=913.0s)]
*  And I was doing really good. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=918.0s)]
*  So part of me was like, this is just me. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=920.0s)]
*  I'm just this person. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=922.0s)]
*  But that wasn't the best version of me. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=923.0s)]
*  Little by little, I've had to tear layers off me and like, hey, this is no good. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=926.0s)]
*  And every time I've done that and I found out something maybe was holding me back, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=930.0s)]
*  I've been able to get to like the next level. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=934.0s)]
*  So it's good to hear somebody like Jordan that addresses and like, bro, you're a pussy, bro. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=936.0s)]
*  If you can't let this go, he tells you how it is. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=942.0s)]
*  It's like, this is why and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=944.0s)]
*  So I like it like that, like straight, raw, like just tell me the truth. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=946.0s)]
*  So I feel that for me personally, not just in the sports, but in like my life in general, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=950.0s)]
*  like finding those things that hold me back and in many things, you know, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=955.0s)]
*  on the personal side that I could bring into the professional. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=959.0s)]
*  And then it's like it makes all the sense in the world. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=962.0s)]
*  You know, like let's say I stop eating Domino's pizza and I'm like a month or whatever junk food I was like binging on. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=965.0s)]
*  And then I see like results and stuff. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=970.0s)]
*  It's like, man, I just got to change my whole lifestyle, not just before the fight, but year round. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=972.0s)]
*  You know, those are those are the things where I like struggle and I've been working on a lot. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=976.0s)]
*  That's the problem, I think, with really talented guys is that you can kind of get away without being disciplined. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=980.0s)]
*  Yeah. And you don't realize that if you were disciplined, you'd be one of the greats. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=986.0s)]
*  Yeah. And it's like I have the discipline to make it to the gym under three hours of sleep or 10 hours of sleep. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=991.0s)]
*  I'm going to I'm going to make it to the practice. The coach is always going to check my name. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=996.0s)]
*  I'm always just going to show up to practice. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=999.0s)]
*  But was it the fucking absolute best version of me showing up to that practice? [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1001.0s)]
*  Many times not, especially when I was younger, man. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1006.0s)]
*  And just because in that room, whatever particular room I was in, I was always like a standout or one of the better guys. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1008.0s)]
*  I was like, I don't got to change nothing, bro. And then, you know, I remember there was a video that the UFC put out. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1014.0s)]
*  I think the UFC put it out was a you younger you were just playing video games all night and just like definitely. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1019.0s)]
*  And everybody was like laughing about this. Just. Yeah. That's what he does. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1025.0s)]
*  Yeah. And you know, since young, since I want to say like 17 years old, I started sleeping like five hours a day just because I couldn't get more than that. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1029.0s)]
*  I lay in bed. I could go to sleep at 10 a.m. and I just wake up like a 5, 6 a.m. wired. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1037.0s)]
*  So I started pushing those boundaries like, well, then I go to sleep at three in the morning. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1042.0s)]
*  I wake up at like nine, just fine. I woke up at ten. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1046.0s)]
*  Fine. And I did that for a large part. And I felt good, you know, but we're age. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1049.0s)]
*  So can't do that no more. Now I get like my five cycles of an hour and a half, at least minimum. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1053.0s)]
*  You know, if not, I feel it nowadays, you know, and this started happening to me when I was like 34, 35. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1058.0s)]
*  Like it took a while for it to hit me. Now sleep is top three priority for me. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1064.0s)]
*  It never used to be. You should be like, I'll take a nap if I'm not tired or something like that. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1068.0s)]
*  Nowadays it's like, man, I need my good sleep. If I'm going to get a good workout in, you know. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1073.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's good that you're aware of that. Some people never learn that lesson. Sleep is everything. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1077.0s)]
*  It is everything. Your body recovers during sleep and also your mind recovers. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1082.0s)]
*  I mean, just to know that you're well rested when you're getting up and getting through the day. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1087.0s)]
*  You just know you got a full battery. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1091.0s)]
*  I didn't I never even believed in that. I was like, man, that's just motherfuckers being pussy. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1094.0s)]
*  What do you mean you need eight hours of sleep? What you need is sleep when you die. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1098.0s)]
*  It should be like a common thing. Everybody around me would all say sleeping is for the birds or for dead people. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1102.0s)]
*  And I really like kind of just embodied that like, man, I don't need to sleep. You go training now. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1106.0s)]
*  It's the complete opposite. I'm trying to clock in as many hours on a consistent basis leading up. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1111.0s)]
*  But this is not just now for this fight camp. I've been I've been trying to implement that for like the last two years of my life. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1115.0s)]
*  Well, I think that's something that, you know, it's a part of what makes fighters great is they have that incredible confidence. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1120.0s)]
*  And they don't give a fuck. And they think they're different. Yeah. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1127.0s)]
*  It's all the great. Yeah. A little bit of that. I mean, look at that's John Jones in a nutshell. Right. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1130.0s)]
*  I mean, John, I mean, the one of the funniest fucking lines ever was when John was talking to D.C. at the press conference. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1135.0s)]
*  He was like, I beat you when I was doing coke. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1140.0s)]
*  A whole night, a weekend of cocaine or something like that. That guy's just like you talk about uber talent. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1143.0s)]
*  That guy's on another level. Next level shit. Next level. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1149.0s)]
*  Fuck. And he happens to be fucking mean. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1152.0s)]
*  So a lot of talented guys sometimes are not like the meanest guy. This guy's mean as they fucking gets. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1155.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's everything. Yeah, that's everything. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1159.0s)]
*  And it's just all the all the above genetics, discipline, intelligence, game planning. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1162.0s)]
*  I mean, nobody game plans like John. Yeah, I've heard he's a student of the game. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1168.0s)]
*  Studios watching film every day all day long. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1172.0s)]
*  Like that is so much discipline, you know, like he's wired that into the system. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1175.0s)]
*  That's who he is. This is a lot of fighters that just don't watch any tape period. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1179.0s)]
*  Do you watch a lot of tape on guys? I watch. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1183.0s)]
*  I watch at different stages and then my coaches will keep breaking down stuff and they'll show it to me. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1186.0s)]
*  I don't watch tape like every day, but I do go on like segments like tonight. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1190.0s)]
*  I saw somebody for like two hours and I just keep that in my brain and I'll try to bring that to spawn. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1195.0s)]
*  And like these are the game plans right that I read in my head. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1200.0s)]
*  I think so and so is a sucker for this, this and that. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1203.0s)]
*  And I bring that into sparring. I try to emulate it. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1208.0s)]
*  And the guys obviously that are bringing to sparring are not the guy I'm going to fight, [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1210.0s)]
*  but they're supposed to be, you know, very similar style, something like that. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1213.0s)]
*  So I know if it starts working on them, then I'm like one step away from bringing into mass production and bringing it to the world. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1216.0s)]
*  So that's kind of how I do it. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1222.0s)]
*  I just also don't want to look at somebody all day long because I want to focus on me and my strength as well. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1223.0s)]
*  You know, I want to be aware of their strengths and what they're good at and what positions I don't want to be involved in. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1228.0s)]
*  But I'm worried about me, you know. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1232.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, I understand. Are you 36 now? [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1235.0s)]
*  38. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1239.0s)]
*  38. Whoa, you look good. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1240.0s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1241.0s)]
*  You look good. How much longer you think you got in the game? [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1242.0s)]
*  You know, that's a question that I've got the answer to it. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1245.0s)]
*  You know, I'm an American top team. I feel best gym in the fucking world. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1250.0s)]
*  We have numerous established killers right now and we have another world of guys coming up of young hungry talent that nobody knows of [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1253.0s)]
*  that are just fucking killers. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1260.0s)]
*  And I've always felt like when I come into the gym and I can't hang with the pack when I can't, you know, do around with, you know, so and so. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1262.0s)]
*  And then after that, go with so and so and so and so and I'm getting the worse end of it consistently. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1271.0s)]
*  I'll call it quits because I don't want to be a step in something for nobody. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1277.0s)]
*  I've been in the sport for 20 years. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1280.0s)]
*  So when I when I get into American top team, I mean, I'm working out with the best of the best. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1282.0s)]
*  You know, I truly feel in my heart that the best middleweight right now, his name is Johnny Eblen. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1286.0s)]
*  He's a bad motherfucker. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1291.0s)]
*  Oh, this guy could wrestle. This guy could punch. This guy could kick. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1293.0s)]
*  He's just a beast. And like we've been sharpening iron me and him forever. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1296.0s)]
*  And, you know, there's days that he fucking runs me over. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1301.0s)]
*  There's days that I do very well that I hold my own. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1304.0s)]
*  And we have great sessions. So the times that I start to just get the worst end of the sessions, it's time for me to hang it up. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1307.0s)]
*  I don't need to go in a ring to find out once I can't keep up with the pack no more. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1315.0s)]
*  I know my time has come and it's going to hurt like fuck because this is all I've known. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1319.0s)]
*  This is my first, my last love. This is my everything. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1323.0s)]
*  But at the same time, I'm not going to do a disservice to my body and let guys beat me. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1326.0s)]
*  They could have never held my jockstrap probably during my prime. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1330.0s)]
*  You know, so that that'll be when I call it quits. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1332.0s)]
*  Once the gym is telling me like, hey, you know, your time has come. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1334.0s)]
*  I'm cool with it. You know, I just fucking gracefully bow out. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1337.0s)]
*  Well, that's a great situation to be in. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1340.0s)]
*  We still have the love, but you're also aware that there's a reality of just your biological limits. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1342.0s)]
*  Yeah. And I mean, it's going to happen to all of us. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1348.0s)]
*  You know, maybe maybe maybe some Randy Couture was fine to what 44, 45. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1350.0s)]
*  Yeah, crazy. He was doing it big. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1355.0s)]
*  Also pre-usada. Yeah, pre-usada. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1357.0s)]
*  A little bit different. Yeah. Those days. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1359.0s)]
*  So versus the Lone Strand, I think it was called. Yeah. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1364.0s)]
*  Well, listen, fucking Vitor changed his whole fucking world when TRT was in. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1366.0s)]
*  All of a sudden, Vitor was the I think TRT Vitor was one of the greatest fighters of all time. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1372.0s)]
*  Most dangerous, you could say. Oh, my God. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1377.0s)]
*  He was so confident when he fought Luke Rockhold and hit him with a wheel kick. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1379.0s)]
*  I'm like, what the fuck? You never even seen Vitor throw wheel kicks before. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1383.0s)]
*  The speed, the power, like something. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1386.0s)]
*  He turns into like a mutant when there's certain things involved in his body. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1389.0s)]
*  Yeah, some little fucking pharmacological intervention. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1393.0s)]
*  A lot of shit gets going. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1396.0s)]
*  I kind of wish they'd bring it back. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1398.0s)]
*  I really do, because there's something about the veterans. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1400.0s)]
*  They have the mind. Like that was the thing with Vitor. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1403.0s)]
*  They had this wealth of experience. I mean, I first saw Vitor fight in 1997. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1406.0s)]
*  I was training the same gym as him because I was at Carlson Gracie's in L.A. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1411.0s)]
*  And he was 19. And, you know, we all knew like, God damn, he was a fucking athlete. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1415.0s)]
*  Crazy athlete. And he was a black belt. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1422.0s)]
*  Brazilian Jiu Jitsu was knocking people dead. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1425.0s)]
*  Yeah, no one expected that. When they first saw him fight like Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt under Carlson Gracie, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1428.0s)]
*  everybody was like, oh, he's going to take guys down and submit him. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1433.0s)]
*  And he was just lighting people up. Trey Tellegman, Scott Ferozo won the tournament at 19. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1435.0s)]
*  Everybody was like, holy shit. Oh, ran through Vandalee. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1441.0s)]
*  And then Vandalee went on that crazy streak of pride. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1444.0s)]
*  So it just elevated the fuck out of Vitor. Yeah. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1446.0s)]
*  Vitor did that to him. Holy smokes. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1449.0s)]
*  I kind of wish they'd let people do whatever the fuck they want to do. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1451.0s)]
*  Well, these other organizations are very lax. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1455.0s)]
*  Or just like make it like even playing field for everybody. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1458.0s)]
*  Because it's just like you sought overseas the Americans a lot harder than a lot of these other countries that they can't even get into. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1462.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. They're not traveling to the mountains of Dagestan to give people piss tests. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1470.0s)]
*  So it's just like, man, just make it fair for everybody. If I'm getting tested 20 times a year. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1474.0s)]
*  So and so and so and so and social should also be getting tested 20 times a year. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1479.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, the worst shit is like you hear stuff from like Volkanovsky. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1483.0s)]
*  They wake him up at like six o'clock in the morning the day before the fight. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1487.0s)]
*  Yeah. Insane. Cut and wait. Yeah. My last camp, it was the same shit. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1491.0s)]
*  It just doesn't make sense. They came in on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday between 515 and like 630 in the morning. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1496.0s)]
*  My fucking house. Three days in a row. Three days in a row. Just to make sure. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1503.0s)]
*  And it's like, well, well, how about my sleep, bro? [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1507.0s)]
*  You guys just right like I usually get up like around eight in the morning. I'm out the door by like 915. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1510.0s)]
*  Like I have a schedule and this is like a week before five. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1515.0s)]
*  You guys are just wrecking my shit because now I'm going to go back to sleep and like or I'm going to stay up. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1518.0s)]
*  Now it's just fucks up your day. You could get hurt in training because that because you're tired. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1523.0s)]
*  You get caught with something maybe you shouldn't have got caught with. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1528.0s)]
*  I get it maybe like one time, but they literally showed up three times in my crib like that. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1530.0s)]
*  Why do you think they do that? Like someone tell them like maybe you're doing something like what they think they're being slick. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1535.0s)]
*  I I just stupid. I don't think I've before that I had gotten tested throughout my career maybe like once or twice around those times. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1541.0s)]
*  And there had been a while where they were just coming in at a regular time. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1552.0s)]
*  Like I'd get to the gym. They're waiting for me. I wake up 715 730. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1555.0s)]
*  They're there. You know, maybe a couple afternoon later shifts at the gym again. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1560.0s)]
*  And that's all understandable, you know, or even catch me right now when I get off the plane at the airport. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1565.0s)]
*  Cool. But you know, Sunday on a Sunday they came. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1569.0s)]
*  I want to let my fucking dogs loose on you know, and I got a big old I got a big old fucking gay. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1573.0s)]
*  I was hoping they would have just jumped that gate and my dogs were they to my life, man. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1578.0s)]
*  It's so stupid. Yeah, it makes me furious. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1582.0s)]
*  It really does. The fact that they did that to fighters that are that are like the day before a title fight, all the things you have to worry about. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1585.0s)]
*  Like if they want to test someone testament fucking one in the afternoon, test them when they're done training, test them before they train, do whatever the fuck you got to do to make sure they're not cheating. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1592.0s)]
*  But don't interrupt their sleep and more so than anything. I think it's consistency. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1601.0s)]
*  Right. Like if you're testing me, I get it. It's random. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1605.0s)]
*  But if you're testing me 20 times and my opponent got tested four times, what the fuck is that? [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1608.0s)]
*  Let's make it. Let's make it fair on all sides. It should be a minimum. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1614.0s)]
*  I think of everybody should get tested like 30 times a fucking year. Right. Yeah. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1618.0s)]
*  And then certain guys that they're really like, hey, I think this guy, OK, fucking double it for that guy. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1622.0s)]
*  Make it 60. But everybody should be at a baseline of getting tested a shitload amount of times. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1626.0s)]
*  I think it's good that the UFC did something. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1631.0s)]
*  But I think ultimately what they did is a little bit of overkill. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1634.0s)]
*  And it just like particularly the IVs for rehydration. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1637.0s)]
*  I just don't I know that they're saying that it can mask performance enhancing drugs. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1642.0s)]
*  But that's if you test them before they get an IV test. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1647.0s)]
*  There's ways to test like it's healthier for the fighter to have an IV. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1650.0s)]
*  It's really healthier for the fighter. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1655.0s)]
*  What they really should do. And I've been saying this forever. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1657.0s)]
*  And I know it's hard to do, but they should outlaw weight cutting. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1660.0s)]
*  They should figure out a way where fighters fight at their natural make more weight classes and have fighters fight at a natural weight. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1663.0s)]
*  You're talking about you got about to fucking go to war for five rounds in a cage 24 hours after you're almost dead, [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1669.0s)]
*  which is really what happens to a lot of these guys. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1677.0s)]
*  It's like running a marathon. That's what I used to feel like, man. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1679.0s)]
*  I'd be just sucking water, no calories, no nothing. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1682.0s)]
*  And then you get in and you're kind of like a shell of yourself, you know. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1685.0s)]
*  But I do agree with you that there is some components that they could monitor your weight during the training camp. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1689.0s)]
*  What's the heaviest you got? What's the lightest you got? [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1695.0s)]
*  Come up with an average of that. And hey, you can't weigh more than 190 on fight day. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1697.0s)]
*  If not, pay a fine or I don't know what the fuck. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1701.0s)]
*  Well, one FC is trying to do something like that. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1704.0s)]
*  But I heard that one of their events, like eight fighters missed weight, which is fucking crazy. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1707.0s)]
*  You know, because they have a hydration test. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1712.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't even understand that. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1714.0s)]
*  I mean, I know they do that with college wrestling. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1716.0s)]
*  I know they do hydration tests, but I don't really agree with those either, though. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1718.0s)]
*  You know, if I did cut more water than the next guy and I still made the weight, the fuck. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1721.0s)]
*  Let me compete. You know, right. Yeah. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1726.0s)]
*  I mean, that Gervonta Davis has a 10 pounds clause. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1728.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1732.0s)]
*  With the with Ryan, where he can't weigh more than a certain amount after the weigh in, which is a little kind of bitch. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1734.0s)]
*  Yeah. And what do you care what he weighs? [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1741.0s)]
*  Yeah. What do you got in that fight? [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1744.0s)]
*  I don't know, man. I mean, I'm a giant Gervonta fan. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1746.0s)]
*  I think he's super fucking talented. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1750.0s)]
*  But Ryan has that left hook. That left hook is preposterous. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1752.0s)]
*  You got the reach on him. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1756.0s)]
*  That left hook is so fast. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1757.0s)]
*  Like he catches guys in exchanges. You don't even see it land. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1759.0s)]
*  But it's mostly left hook. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1763.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know, I know he has a right hand. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1765.0s)]
*  He uses it, but his left hook is just so that style that he uses using that reach and just whipping that left hook. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1767.0s)]
*  It's very unusual. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1773.0s)]
*  And his speed is way above natural. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1775.0s)]
*  He's he's he's really up there with the hand speed. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1777.0s)]
*  But so is Gervonta. And especially in the pocket. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1780.0s)]
*  I mean, Gervonta in the pocket is a monster. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1783.0s)]
*  He reminds me like a little Tyson. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1785.0s)]
*  He's short and he like he conserves his punches where, you know, like the first few rounds, he throws very few punches. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1787.0s)]
*  He's just measuring. He's a computer man. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1793.0s)]
*  Yeah. He's just getting the data on you and taking pictures of everything you're doing. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1795.0s)]
*  And then like round three, round four, he starts to fucking just he's dialed in. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1799.0s)]
*  He's slipping. He's got special power. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1803.0s)]
*  His power is special. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1805.0s)]
*  And he's mean too. Oh, yeah. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1807.0s)]
*  Mean is a big part of it, isn't it? [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1809.0s)]
*  I think I think having that dog being mean is like the biggest part of it, you know, in being a fighter. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1811.0s)]
*  Yeah, because you could be you'd be a great athlete. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1817.0s)]
*  One day you're going to come across another great athlete. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1820.0s)]
*  You know, it's who's got more dog in them. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1822.0s)]
*  Do you think Wonderboy is mean? [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1824.0s)]
*  I think he's secretly mean. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1826.0s)]
*  Has to be. He's very, very, very competitive. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1828.0s)]
*  He's the nicest dude that I've one of the coolest guys in the for real nice guy. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1832.0s)]
*  Like I've met him numerous times off camera, just me and him chilling. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1836.0s)]
*  And the dude's generally like a good dude, you know. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1839.0s)]
*  But once he gets in there, he's like he's hyper competitive. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1842.0s)]
*  He wants to win at all costs. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1844.0s)]
*  He's going to put himself at harm's risk to make sure he gets that W man. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1846.0s)]
*  I've always I've always liked Wonderboy. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1849.0s)]
*  I couldn't believe Kevin Holland decided to have a kickboxing fight with him. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1851.0s)]
*  I couldn't believe Kevin Holland made a deal. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1855.0s)]
*  No going to the ground. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1857.0s)]
*  Let's just stand up. Like, what are you saying? [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1859.0s)]
*  I don't think Holland was going to take him down anyways. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1861.0s)]
*  Well, I think he would try. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1863.0s)]
*  I mean, he would have been worse. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1865.0s)]
*  Fantastic jujitsu guy. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1867.0s)]
*  The wrestling, the wrestling. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1869.0s)]
*  Yeah. And that is like one of the things that drains people, you know, he might have got stopped earlier if he went for a takedown. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1870.0s)]
*  And I think that's kind of what her is he in the per area fight, putting those takedowns up there. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1875.0s)]
*  It takes a lot of gas. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1880.0s)]
*  If you if you haven't been doing that for a lifetime, wrestling is one of the most draining things for the energy tank. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1881.0s)]
*  Without a doubt. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1886.0s)]
*  I think with Izzy, though, what he talked about that left leg getting compromised, the calf kicks. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1887.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, Pahara landed like six calf kicks in that first round, like hard ones. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1892.0s)]
*  Calf kick changed the fuck. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1897.0s)]
*  Do you remember when the calf kick came into the game? [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1900.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1902.0s)]
*  Was Benson Henderson was the guy who first started using it, but it wasn't as effective for some reason. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1903.0s)]
*  It's like other guys started using it and stopping people with it. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1908.0s)]
*  I think Ben. Yeah, you're right. Benson. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1911.0s)]
*  He was one of the first guys. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1913.0s)]
*  Chopped up Nate with him pretty damn good. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1915.0s)]
*  I use him a lot. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1917.0s)]
*  I remember I use him a lot for my KJ Noon's fight. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1920.0s)]
*  I use him a ton to chop him up because he's a big boxer. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1923.0s)]
*  So I chopped his leg down with the calf kick just boom, constantly going through. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1925.0s)]
*  He throw like a left hook. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1928.0s)]
*  Pop. I chopped the calf. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1929.0s)]
*  He throw a jab. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1931.0s)]
*  I chopped the calf and that threw him off. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1932.0s)]
*  I remember his balance because he started like kind of second guessing me and not putting as much pressure. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1934.0s)]
*  But I big believer of the calf kick. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1939.0s)]
*  You know, I felt it and I was like, this is it right here. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1941.0s)]
*  It's horrible. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1944.0s)]
*  And your leg is so much bigger, so much more muscle. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1945.0s)]
*  You could take the hit to the one calf kick hits that nerve stem and it fucking shoots up to your brain. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1948.0s)]
*  And you're like, well, don't take no more of those. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1955.0s)]
*  It's amazing because to the average person, they don't even know what happened. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1957.0s)]
*  Like they see a guy get calf kicked and the guy's still moving and they feel like nothing happened. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1961.0s)]
*  But meanwhile, that guy who got kicked is like, oh shit. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1965.0s)]
*  Like you got a poker face, but that leg is fucked. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1968.0s)]
*  Fucked. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1972.0s)]
*  And then bam, if someone hits it again, bang, they hit it again. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1973.0s)]
*  Like, oh no, then you're in trouble. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1975.0s)]
*  Then they switch stances and then you know, like, oh, he got him. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1977.0s)]
*  Yep. Yep. He got him. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1980.0s)]
*  Yeah. And you're always calling. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1981.0s)]
*  I could always see when you call and he's like, yep, that calf kick hurt. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1982.0s)]
*  He's switching stance guaranteed it hurt, you know. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1985.0s)]
*  Well, when you're up close to you could see the calf swelling up. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1987.0s)]
*  Like guys, calves will swell up like immediately. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1990.0s)]
*  And it's not that, it's not that big. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1992.0s)]
*  Like it's big, but in like kickboxing and Muay Thai wasn't like a, I know it's crazy. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=1995.0s)]
*  It was more like an MMA thing. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2001.0s)]
*  And then now I'm seeing it more and more in Thai boxing now, but it wasn't like maybe 15 years ago. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2002.0s)]
*  It wasn't a big thing in kickboxing or Muay Thai. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2007.0s)]
*  No, it's very interesting. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2009.0s)]
*  I'm trying to figure out why. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2011.0s)]
*  I guess like a lot of the Thai guys, they fight with that light front leg, you know, [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2013.0s)]
*  and they check a lot of kicks and they're accustomed to it. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2017.0s)]
*  But I think it's a stance. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2020.0s)]
*  It's a, you know, because you might shoot and because you might have to sprawl, [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2022.0s)]
*  there's like a little bit more weight on that leg. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2027.0s)]
*  And then, you know, I don't know. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2029.0s)]
*  Definitely for that. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2031.0s)]
*  It changes a lot. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2032.0s)]
*  And there's so much options in MMA, you know. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2033.0s)]
*  You're just worried about strikes and in combat. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2035.0s)]
*  Here you're worried about a clinch or take down or somebody dropping guard, you know. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2037.0s)]
*  I mean, I love all combat sports, but there's no comparison. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2041.0s)]
*  MMA is where it's at. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2044.0s)]
*  It's the best. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2045.0s)]
*  What's your second favorite? [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2046.0s)]
*  Muay Thai. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2047.0s)]
*  I love Muay Thai. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2048.0s)]
*  I love Muay Thai. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2049.0s)]
*  Yeah, I love Muay Thai. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2050.0s)]
*  Who's your favorite Thai fighter? [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2052.0s)]
*  Man, I mean, San Chai. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2054.0s)]
*  You got to go with San Chai because he's been around so long and he's still fucking people up at like 37 years old. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2056.0s)]
*  And the grace that he does. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2063.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2064.0s)]
*  And the style is so different than everybody else's. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2065.0s)]
*  He's light on his feet and he throws kicks with no telegraph. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2067.0s)]
*  Like a lot of these guys, they're like power guys. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2072.0s)]
*  You know, they're plodding forward like Rod Tang. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2075.0s)]
*  But, you know, San Chai is just light on his feet. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2078.0s)]
*  Everything's shuffling and moving quick. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2082.0s)]
*  He's very different. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2084.0s)]
*  Like there's no one like him. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2085.0s)]
*  Since I started watching San Chai, I was like, man, what makes him so special? [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2087.0s)]
*  I would really like dig into it because he's obviously like Michael Jordan of Muay Thai, you know. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2091.0s)]
*  And I think one of the things that makes him so special is his ability to take you off your feet at any moment. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2097.0s)]
*  So that like I see him fighting guys and they immediately change styles when they're fighting him. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2104.0s)]
*  They might be like a little looser and then they get swept off their feet. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2108.0s)]
*  Now they're just like they're balanced, got compromised. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2111.0s)]
*  And that's a huge thing. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2113.0s)]
*  Like you kick and I put you on your neck and shoulders. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2114.0s)]
*  You're going to rethink everything, man. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2118.0s)]
*  And I think he's like the best at fucking manipulating your balance and sending you flying across the ring. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2119.0s)]
*  And I've seen a dude to like great boxers, great kickboxers, great Thai guys. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2125.0s)]
*  They lose all sense of like where they're at and stuff. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2129.0s)]
*  Once you're flying through there and you get back and now you're kind of like a shell of yourself. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2133.0s)]
*  Now you're like, I don't want to get fucking swept again. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2136.0s)]
*  And then boom, I left and then boom, I kick and then boom, you get swept again. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2138.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2142.0s)]
*  Bro, it's fucking insane. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2143.0s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2144.0s)]
*  I agree. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2145.0s)]
*  The sweeps are that's a big key to his game and also the angles. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2146.0s)]
*  There's one KO where he hops to the side and jumping roundhouse kicks that dude in the face where he like the type of dog. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2150.0s)]
*  I mean, this motherfucker is just his timing and his ability to like shit like that. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2157.0s)]
*  I mean, look at that. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2164.0s)]
*  I mean, what the fuck? [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2165.0s)]
*  What a crazy angle. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2167.0s)]
*  His angles. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2168.0s)]
*  And when you look at him to one of the things I like about him, he's not an impressive looking dude. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2169.0s)]
*  No, he's not like the fittest physical specimen. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2173.0s)]
*  And he's fighting guys way bigger than him all the time. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2176.0s)]
*  He's always fighting guys bigger than him. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2179.0s)]
*  His fights with no gloves. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2181.0s)]
*  Fucking love. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2182.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2183.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2184.0s)]
*  With the ropes. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2185.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2186.0s)]
*  Sancai is a motherfucker, dude. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2187.0s)]
*  And seems like one of the nicest, most playful dudes. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2189.0s)]
*  Like when you see him working out and sparring in the gym, he's a fun dude. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2192.0s)]
*  Playful to that bell rings. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2197.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2198.0s)]
*  But it's just that like right there. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2199.0s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2201.0s)]
*  The sweeps, man. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2202.0s)]
*  It's just that style. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2203.0s)]
*  It was so different than anybody else's style. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2204.0s)]
*  It's really kind of amazing that none of the young guys are emulating him because traditionally, [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2207.0s)]
*  when you see Thai guys fight, they fight and they look like a Thai fighter. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2213.0s)]
*  He looks like another thing, like another kind of thing, another evolution of it. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2216.0s)]
*  I hope in his next lifetime, it's just MMA for him. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2221.0s)]
*  That guy doing like. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2224.0s)]
*  Do you imagine? [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2225.0s)]
*  He would have done Thai boxing until like 14, 15, then got brought into MMA at that age. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2226.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2230.0s)]
*  With a great camp. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2231.0s)]
*  Oh my goodness. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2232.0s)]
*  Well, that element is one of the elements that I feel like is missing in MMA is the sweeps. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2233.0s)]
*  Like there's just very few guys that are that good at sweeps, you know, from the standing position in MMA. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2238.0s)]
*  Most of the takedowns we see in MMA come off singles and doubles and trips. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2245.0s)]
*  You don't see it like that, like what he does. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2249.0s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2251.0s)]
*  Not that many. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2252.0s)]
*  One of the ones that I love is you throw like that high kick, then you'll fake the high kick [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2253.0s)]
*  and completely get behind you. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2257.0s)]
*  And then you see him flare. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2259.0s)]
*  And those are the things that like shut you out. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2261.0s)]
*  Because now if you're worried about the sweep, you're going to get kicked, whether it's in your head or your arm. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2263.0s)]
*  You're going to start getting kicked and nobody does it like him. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2268.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's one of the beautiful things about watching a great Muay Thai fighter like him is that for someone who appreciates it, [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2271.0s)]
*  there's so many levels to what he's doing. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2278.0s)]
*  He's setting up so many levels. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2280.0s)]
*  There's so many different things going on simultaneously that you have to compensate for when you're fighting it. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2282.0s)]
*  Best, best team two in the game. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2287.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. He hops forward and hits you in the face with it. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2289.0s)]
*  One of my favorite guys also, I can't pronounce his name. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2291.0s)]
*  I don't even want to try to because then he's going to kick my butt. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2294.0s)]
*  I'm going to butcher it. But he's Olympic gold medalist in boxing and he's like a three time Lumpini champion. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2296.0s)]
*  I know who you're talking about and I can't pronounce his name either. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2301.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. That guy was another serial killer, bro. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2304.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2307.0s)]
*  Man, because to have head movement, I think in Thai boxing, like to stay in the pocket, do this and dodge kicks, that's next level shit. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2308.0s)]
*  And this guy would do it to everybody. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2315.0s)]
*  I'm a giant fan of his, but I'm also, if I had one fighter that I'm going to watch tape on just for pure inspiration, it's Ramon Deckers. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2317.0s)]
*  Oh. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2324.0s)]
*  Whoo. Ramon Deckers in his prime. What a fucking destroyer that guy was. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2325.0s)]
*  That guy smashed his ankle so bad, they had to fuse his ankle and the doctor told him, listen, man, you got to stop kicking with this thing. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2331.0s)]
*  And he's like, yeah, tape it up. Shut the fuck up. Bam, like right away. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2338.0s)]
*  Like in the end of his career, his ankles didn't move. Like his foot was like stuck there forever. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2343.0s)]
*  That you got to be so fucking like so mentally off, you know, because we've seen everybody that has like a shin break and then comes back. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2349.0s)]
*  It's just like you can't blame him, man. Am I going to the next kick is going to snap off. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2358.0s)]
*  So for somebody to have that commitment is fucking nuts. Like me personally, I would be like, okay, time to adapt. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2363.0s)]
*  I'm going to become a puncher now, bro. Yeah. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2368.0s)]
*  Well, doesn't Tyrone, Tyrone Spong, doesn't he train sometimes at ATT? He's been there before, right? [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2370.0s)]
*  No, no, no. He's more at Stanford. I've had the pleasure of meeting Tyrone, a fucking beast. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2376.0s)]
*  I've met him a couple of times, but no, he's not at ATT. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2382.0s)]
*  When he broke his leg, he was kind of never the same again. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2385.0s)]
*  I mean, he had a real bad one with Go Kon Sake. Same as like Chris Weidman, same as Anderson Silva. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2389.0s)]
*  The same kind of break with check and kick. Like it just snapped in half. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2395.0s)]
*  He's doing well in boxing though. Yes, very well. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2400.0s)]
*  I would love to see that guy grab a belt for us, man. Yeah, kickboxer, MMA dude. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2403.0s)]
*  And he's like unreal power. Since he was at 168 pounds, I saw his whole career of the heavyweight, like unreal fucking power, bro. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2408.0s)]
*  He's saying good reflexes, good timing, you know, just fucking I would love to see him get a belt in fucking boxing. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2415.0s)]
*  There's that one amazing KO where he's fighting that tall white dude and the guy catches him in the first round, drops him. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2421.0s)]
*  And then he measures him. The dude's whale arm, he measures him, measures him, bang! And it's over. Flat lines. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2427.0s)]
*  He gets up and then he sits back down like that's it. It's over. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2433.0s)]
*  There's guys that are like just born with that next little problem. He's one of them, bro. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2438.0s)]
*  You don't see very many guys bouncing back from that shin break and doing well in MMA again. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2442.0s)]
*  Anderson, it was kind of the end of his career when he broke his shin. I mean, Chris Weidman, we haven't seen him back yet. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2449.0s)]
*  Connor, we haven't seen him back yet. I don't know what's even going to happen. Here it is. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2454.0s)]
*  Boom! Okay. I mean, that dude got up and he was like, hang on, what the fuck is going on here? [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2460.0s)]
*  You know what? Never mind. Yeah. He realized like something's very wrong. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2469.0s)]
*  The way he measured him too. Just that straight left, bang! Oh my goodness. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2475.0s)]
*  And look how composed Tyrone Stasier's hands are up, shoulders are up. He's taking these hits. He's like, I got you. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2480.0s)]
*  And he got dropped like seconds into the fight. Like it was one of the first punches that dude threw. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2485.0s)]
*  Yeah, Tyrone's a bad motherfucker. He was supposed to fight some big boxing fights. Is he? No, he was supposed to. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2491.0s)]
*  He was and then something happened. I don't know. I remember what happened, but he got pulled out of the fight and then dude wanted to fight somebody else. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2497.0s)]
*  But they were setting him up for someone big. I forget who it was. Who's stick? I think. Oh, that's right. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2504.0s)]
*  And that one ended up falling through. Some stuff happened, you know? That's too bad. That would have been very interesting. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2510.0s)]
*  I would love to get him on my promotion against some of these big boxers that we've been talking to. I would love to do like Andy Ruiz versus Old Man. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2515.0s)]
*  So tell me about your promotion because you've got a big card coming up. Tell me about that. It's very exciting. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2523.0s)]
*  Tickets available on Ticketmaster. I got to go full promoter on you, John. Yeah, go full promoter. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2529.0s)]
*  Pay per view. Yeah, on demand. Yeah, Comcast, all that linear pay per view stuff. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2534.0s)]
*  And if you want the digital rights, only the second time in history to you, you see partners up with like a boxing promotion. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2539.0s)]
*  The first time was Connor Mayweather. So you could also buy the pay per view through UFC Fight Pass. Oh, that's great. Yeah. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2545.0s)]
*  And it's Roy Jones Jr. and Anthony Patterson. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2551.0s)]
*  Jose Aldo versus Jeremy Stevens boxing. I think that that's going to be the fight of the night. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2556.0s)]
*  You know, I could be wrong because there's some other good matches. And Bitor Belfort, the guy we just talked about versus Jacare. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2562.0s)]
*  Who you got in mind? Oh my God. Who you got in mind? Wow. Look at that. At the Pfizer for Milwaukee Bucks Arena. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2566.0s)]
*  I like it. I'm very interested in Jones versus Pettis. How long has Roy been training for this? [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2575.0s)]
*  So, um, my good friend, the one that helped me because as we were setting up the card, Dean Tool, which is my matchmaker and helps me set up everything was like, I think I get Roy Jones a five for us. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2582.0s)]
*  And my mind, I was like, yeah, I'm sure, bro. Roy Jones. You talking about Roy Jones Jr.? Yeah, man. I because he's from Pensacola and he's known Roy for a while. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2594.0s)]
*  Roy's been training for a while. Now people don't know, but he's been training. He constantly trains and he trains. He was training you banks. So he told me at the whole training camp when you banks, he was training alongside him. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2605.0s)]
*  He's in pretty damn good shape, better shape that I've seen him in a while. And he's been wanting to fight. So I think we might be able to pull this off. I was like, no, I don't believe this. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2614.0s)]
*  I don't believe this is Roy Jones Jr. Yeah, I think I get Roy Jones Jr. to fight. So we started making calls. You know, we had we had a couple big names actually for a while. It was going to be Roy Jones Jr. He had already signed the contract versus Donald Serone. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2625.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah, we're really excited about that one. And Donald Serone got a huge project coming up. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2639.0s)]
*  I feel it, bro. I believe it, bro. He's got the looks. He's got the character, bro. He's got hair transplants now. Now he's jacked. He's 220 pounds now. It's going to be like the MMA Brad Pickett, bro. Not Brad Pickett at all. What's the name? [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2645.0s)]
*  Brad Pitt? Brad Pitt, man. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Shout out to Brad Pickett too. That's my boy, man. I love Brad Pickett. I love seeing him in the crowd the other night. Yeah, Donald is he's a fucking character, man. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2661.0s)]
*  He told a story on this podcast about cave diving. He was cave diving with this dude. The dude panicked and it filled the cave up with clouds and he couldn't figure out how to get out. He was running out of air. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2672.0s)]
*  It was I knew he was alive because he's sitting right across from me. But it was one of the most hair raising stories. He said because his wife and his child were outside waiting for him. And he's thinking there's no fucking way I'm dying in here. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2682.0s)]
*  There's no fucking way I'm dying. And then you said cave diving like cave diving. Like he goes scuba diving and gets down in these caves. I thought you were like jumping out of caves into. Oh, wow. Yeah. So they something happened. Fuck out of me. Oh, fuck all that, dude. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2696.0s)]
*  Fuck that. But Donald likes to do shit that's scary as fuck. That's what he likes to do. And he almost lost his life. It was a crazy story. And when he's telling it, you like your hands are sweating, even though I knew he was alive. I knew he was OK. I'm like, oh, my God. Oh, my God. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2712.0s)]
*  I do a lot of swimming for preparation of the fight just to develop my lungs better. We do a lot of like underwater's down and back. And I fucking hate that shit. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2729.0s)]
*  There's nothing scarier than running out of air in the fucking ocean. And especially I'm just like three feet under the water. So at any moment I get to my feet and push up, you know, and it's over. No matter how fucking close to death I might have thought I was, you know, it's over. It's like to be 20, 30, 100 feet under the water. Not me, dog. Not me. Not me. Not me. I appreciate it, but not me. I'll pass. I'll pass, too. Yeah. Well, you got Pettis or Roy Jones before we move on. Well, I mean, I've never seen Pettis box. He obviously has hands. He knocked out one. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2739.0s)]
*  He looks in great fucking shape, too. It's a great opportunity for him, too. I've gotten to see a little bit of sparring matches between like him and Caleb and a couple of other guys. He looks pretty damn good. One thing he's always had is speed and power. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2769.0s)]
*  I think just genetically born with it, you know, is just how does he bring it over to boxing now, which is I heard him talking a lot about boxing. But what I like to see like MMA guys bring into boxing is we're not going to jab better than you're not going to. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2781.0s)]
*  You're not going to be a boxer better than them ever. But what we can catch him with is that funky like MMA shit like dunk your head and think you're going to body shine. You bring up a fucking loopy right hand, you know, kind of like Connor Mayweather those first like four rounds. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2794.0s)]
*  I know Mayweather was studying, but still he got hit with a lot of things he just didn't see because you can't emulate that. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2807.0s)]
*  Connor could have been a great boxer. He could have been a great boxer. Definitely has the pot for it. Yeah. He's got a tremendous uppercut, too. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2813.0s)]
*  The uppercut that he caught Floyd with, you can snap Floyd's head back. He was like, oh, OK. Yeah, that was legit. He just wasn't composed enough to go 10 rounds with one of the greatest of all time, the greatest of all time. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2821.0s)]
*  If you want to look at guys that never got hit, Floyd went his entire career got hit hard like three or four times ever. He's in defensively unparalleled and he wasn't a mover. He stood right in front of you. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2835.0s)]
*  Not always in his career. Earlier in his career he would use his legs a lot. Then nobody could literally touch him. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2848.0s)]
*  Like when he fought Diego Chico Corrales, one of my favorite all time fights because there was nothing for Diego to hit and all of a sudden he just bounced in his face, left hook from like five feet away. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2855.0s)]
*  That's a Mayweather that I think nobody could possibly maybe beat. That was the pretty boy Floyd Mayweather. That was before he became money Mayweather. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2867.0s)]
*  He started developing hand problems. He broke his hands multiple times. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2875.0s)]
*  Or the Arturo Gatti Mayweather. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2879.0s)]
*  Oh my God, he lit Arturo Gatti. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2881.0s)]
*  That was like his coming out party for the masses. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2884.0s)]
*  He lit him on fire. Because everybody knew Gatti was his blood and guts fighter and everybody was like, oh, let's see how Gatti does. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2886.0s)]
*  And I remember seeing Gatti and thinking like, man, this guy's got hand speed. He's got good hand speed, good power. I think it should be the first couple rounds somewhat competitive, not even close. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2893.0s)]
*  Not even close. Not even close. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2903.0s)]
*  I think Floyd's ability to shoulder roll and his ability to avoid shots and then land shots when you don't think he can is unparalleled. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2905.0s)]
*  I mean, when he fought Canelo and he was like standing right in front of Canelo and Canelo was just whiffing, you know, he was like, oh my God, it was a life lesson. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2914.0s)]
*  And then you look at how good Canelo's head movement got after that fight when he realized it. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2921.0s)]
*  I mean, my God, when he fought Danny Jacobs and Canelo's just standing right in front of him, that's all what he learned from fighting Floyd. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2927.0s)]
*  And it doesn't look like it, but obviously when Mayweather hits, it cracks. Maybe he's not a home run hitter, but he's definitely a third base hitter, you know, because he hits guys and they're like, whoa, they feel it. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2936.0s)]
*  And then he gets out the way. I think definitely the greatest boxer maybe in my generation, but not the best fighter. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2947.0s)]
*  I think the best brawler boxer type fighter Manny Pacquiao. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2953.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Oh, Manny Pacquiao. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2956.0s)]
*  He put world titles in eight different weight classes. Who the fuck does that? [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2958.0s)]
*  And the way he did it. I'm a huge fan of Cotto. I love this school. And the way that he beat Cotto, I didn't think nobody could ever do that to him. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2963.0s)]
*  And he was just like, bro, what the fuck? [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2970.0s)]
*  Well, his legs, Manny's legs are like tree trunks. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2972.0s)]
*  And the hand speed, the power. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2975.0s)]
*  Speed. Everything. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2977.0s)]
*  I just always wish that the Mayweather Pacquiao fight would have took place many, many years before than when it did. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2978.0s)]
*  Well, it also took place and Manny went into the fight with a fucked up shoulder. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2983.0s)]
*  I mean, he knew his shoulder was fucked before that fight and just wanted that money. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2987.0s)]
*  And just let's see what happens. Shoot it up with cortisone, put his roll. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2991.0s)]
*  Yeah. Unfortunately. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2995.0s)]
*  Unfortunate for us, man. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2997.0s)]
*  Unfortunate for us, but Floyd was smart. He's like, not yet, not yet, not yet. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=2998.0s)]
*  Waited until he started to fade a little bit. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3004.0s)]
*  Like, OK, now after Marquez knocked him out. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3006.0s)]
*  Mayweather was, I think, one of the best two at doing that, like picking the opponent at the right time, like Shane Mosley, Shane and stuff like that. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3009.0s)]
*  Well, Shane cracked him. That was one of the hardest he got ever. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3015.0s)]
*  He almost went down to an ear. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3019.0s)]
*  And then Mayweather showed the dog in that fight. After that, he came back and got it. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3021.0s)]
*  Well, Shane was a great fighter. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3027.0s)]
*  But what Floyd brought to the table was that combination of discipline and technique and intelligence and just just constant, steady improvement. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3030.0s)]
*  I mean, that guy was a treat. He was a treat to watch. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3043.0s)]
*  And he's still out there doing these exhibitions. Just hilarious. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3046.0s)]
*  Picking up 10 million here, 10 million there. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3049.0s)]
*  Fucking people up. People that have no business being in there with them. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3052.0s)]
*  I've seen some of the videos of him getting YouTubers and shit and just torturing him. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3056.0s)]
*  I'm a mean motherfucker, so I personally like to see that. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3062.0s)]
*  Especially when guys think, like, I've been boxing for like two, three years. I could have had. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3065.0s)]
*  Oh, hilarious. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3069.0s)]
*  You don't get it. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3070.0s)]
*  It's funny because you think, like, my hands are good. I'm moving. I'm good. I'll be all right. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3071.0s)]
*  And then you're in there with him. Pop! [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3076.0s)]
*  And he's like standing right in front. Pop! [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3078.0s)]
*  And you're like, oh, no. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3080.0s)]
*  Like a coiled rattlesnake or something. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3082.0s)]
*  He's a special fighter. And I think he set the bar for a lot of upcoming guys. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3085.0s)]
*  Like a lot of these guys like Gervonta who trained with them and all these guys. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3090.0s)]
*  That sets the bar when you got a guy who's that good. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3094.0s)]
*  And then you see how many doors you could break down just by submitting to your craft and forgetting about the world. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3096.0s)]
*  And like there's a million things I could be doing, but I'm just going to focus on this and everything else will come. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3102.0s)]
*  I think Mayweather is one of the best stories. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3107.0s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3109.0s)]
*  Look at all he's accomplished outside of boxing as well. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3110.0s)]
*  No, look, it's amazing what he's doing with business. I mean, I follow him on Instagram. It's hilarious. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3112.0s)]
*  He's always in Abu Dhabi and Dubai and he's making money, making deals. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3116.0s)]
*  Look at my cars. Look at my watch. This is my big watch. I got a bigger watch. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3121.0s)]
*  Sometimes I bust out this watch. He brings in like a fucking suitcase filled with million dollar watches. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3125.0s)]
*  It's like... [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3130.0s)]
*  Boxing money. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3132.0s)]
*  It's hilarious. Boxing money, man. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3133.0s)]
*  Boxing money. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3134.0s)]
*  And his boxing money is different than everybody's boxing money now. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3135.0s)]
*  First of all, because he made so much. But then on top of that, he continues to make money even after he's semi-retired. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3138.0s)]
*  You know, he had it under his promotions. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3143.0s)]
*  I think I remember it was like either an interview or something that I read that when him and De La Hoya fought, [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3145.0s)]
*  I think he made a couple, I want to say 17 and something. It was like a good purse. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3151.0s)]
*  But De La Hoya made like a hundred million because it was under his promotion. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3157.0s)]
*  And then right after that Mayweather only did Mayweather promotions and that's when that came in. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3160.0s)]
*  That's when he started clocking those massive checks, you know? [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3164.0s)]
*  Yeah. But he spends a lot too. So he's got to keep that money flowing in. It's kind of fun to watch. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3166.0s)]
*  Yeah, definitely. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3172.0s)]
*  He's a character. But the fact that he goes over to Japan, fights Ten Shin, Nasukawa, who had no business in there with him. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3173.0s)]
*  He's a 126 pounder. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3180.0s)]
*  I would have liked to seen that kickboxing. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3182.0s)]
*  Oh my God. Ten Shin would have fucked him up. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3184.0s)]
*  Yeah. I would have paid good money to see that kickboxing. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3186.0s)]
*  I really thought Ten Shin is, he beat those fucking Lupini champions and the way he did it, I was like, fuck bro, this guy is scary. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3188.0s)]
*  His kicks. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3195.0s)]
*  Yeah. Those counter kicks, you know? [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3196.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3198.0s)]
*  And great hands for multi-kickboxing, the speed, the accuracy. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3199.0s)]
*  I think he's one of the better striker fighters we got to see for that time period. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3202.0s)]
*  No doubt. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3206.0s)]
*  He was really crushing it. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3207.0s)]
*  But he's tiny. He's so small compared to Mayweather. He just had no business being in there with him. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3208.0s)]
*  My friends are like, duh bro, that was a fixed fight. No, no it wasn't a fixed fight. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3214.0s)]
*  There's a tiny guy against the best boxer of all time. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3218.0s)]
*  Yeah. In boxing. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3221.0s)]
*  Yeah. In boxing. There's no reason why they should have been doing that. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3222.0s)]
*  But he's able to get guys to fight him. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3227.0s)]
*  I mean, he's got MMA guys lined up. He's got all these different people lined up. He goes over and fights these exhibitions. It's amazing. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3231.0s)]
*  Collecting checks. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3238.0s)]
*  Yeah. Having fun. Walking around with the ring card girl's card. Dancing. Under no threat at all. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3239.0s)]
*  And you know, he's 46, 47 years old. Still moves fantastic. Still looks great. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3245.0s)]
*  I heard he lives a very disciplined life. Doesn't drink. Doesn't smoke. Yeah, he'll stay up late. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3251.0s)]
*  But he's going to go right back to sleep and wake up and train. And it's a constant thing for him. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3257.0s)]
*  He hasn't left the system. So I think when any dude is like, man, I'm done with this. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3262.0s)]
*  And then three, four years you pick it up, he might not be the same. Especially aged best fighter. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3268.0s)]
*  This is a guy that you could tell he never left the gym. Maybe he left it when he retired. A couple weeks maybe. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3272.0s)]
*  But he's like always in there. You know, you always see him working out, doing something. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3277.0s)]
*  That's everything. And that's like Bernard Hopkins too. Same thing. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3280.0s)]
*  Like Bernard Hopkins was world class up until he was 50. Which was incredible. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3284.0s)]
*  I mean Bernard Hopkins beat a world champion when he was 50 years old. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3289.0s)]
*  I mean he was the most disciplined. And that's a guy that learned that from going to prison. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3292.0s)]
*  He went to prison and was like this is never happening to me again. I'm going to be a fucking completely different person. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3297.0s)]
*  Ate clean, exercised, slept right, never did anything wrong, took care of his body. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3303.0s)]
*  And still to this day he'll post videos of him working out. And he looks fantastic. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3309.0s)]
*  Yeah, mean motherfucker too. Oh yeah. Oh my god dude. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3313.0s)]
*  I mean he was in his prime. I mean I remember when he fought Tito Trinidad. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3317.0s)]
*  And everybody was counting him out. And when he grabbed the Puerto Rican flag and threw it down. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3322.0s)]
*  And everybody was like no! They were chasing him. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3326.0s)]
*  Yeah I heard it was ugly though. Puerto Rican started breaking bottles over his security team's head and stuff like that. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3329.0s)]
*  Like that was crazy. I know he was trying to sell pay-per-view but damn that's nuts. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3334.0s)]
*  That's not a good way to do it. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3337.0s)]
*  A dude in Puerto Rico like that, you get killed. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3339.0s)]
*  I know, I know. But he pulled it off. And that fight man, he established himself in that fight. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3341.0s)]
*  And I believe at that time he was like a lot of people were thinking he was done. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3347.0s)]
*  Because he was like in his late 30s. He was just getting started. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3350.0s)]
*  He still has a record for most title defenses. I won 60 or something like that I think. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3354.0s)]
*  Or definitely up there. Maybe he was tied with the Argentinian guy Monchon, something like that. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3357.0s)]
*  Yeah, maybe. Yeah. I don't know what the record is in boxing but I mean. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3362.0s)]
*  I remember something stupid like 14 or 16 title defenses at 160. Something crazy. Some long, long streak. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3367.0s)]
*  But he was, he's special in that. I remember watching him when he was just a middleweight champion and nobody knew who he was. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3374.0s)]
*  And there was a lot of people that were complaining about his style. His style was boring because he would clinch guys. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3383.0s)]
*  But then you realize he's not getting hit. He was so, and frustrate guys, get them out of their, lose their composure. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3389.0s)]
*  And then he would start fucking them up. Yeah. Little sneaky right, little sneaky left hook. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3396.0s)]
*  That's, did you remember his fight with Roy Jones? That's when also you were like, we know Hopkins is good but Roy Jones is a fucking alien, bro. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3400.0s)]
*  Oh my god, the first fight. The second fight you saw the difference because Roy was starting to slow down. Bernard had such discipline and technique. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3408.0s)]
*  Whereas Roy, Roy in his prime, in my opinion, was the freak of all freaks. Yeah, agreed. The freak of all freaks. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3417.0s)]
*  Playing basketball games before knocking people the fuck out for two hours. Yeah, play a full game of basketball and then go and fuck people up. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3424.0s)]
*  Slam dunking like he's fucking jumping off a trampoline. His speed. I believe with you he's a freak of freaks, man. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3429.0s)]
*  His speed was insane. He would throw a left hook instead of a jab. Constant. I mean, his, always throwing left hooks. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3434.0s)]
*  And you just, like when you see, that's what's really crazy to me. Like if I'm seeing tape and I'm a fighter, I'm like, well I know he's going to throw his left hook so I'm going to try to counter with this. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3440.0s)]
*  And the speed and the setup is so out of this world that you don't even see it. It's a left hook. It's like something that we've been seeing our whole lives. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3449.0s)]
*  And it takes a lot longer than this. You know, you've got to cock it back and you've got to throw it, especially the way he would throw it. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3457.0s)]
*  Here and boom, explode and people can't see it. The world's best couldn't see it. So I'm just with you, man. I've always thought that that guy was a fucking mutant, bro. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3462.0s)]
*  Yeah, during his prime, I think he's the greatest. I think he's the greatest middleweight ever. Like right up there with Hagler. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3472.0s)]
*  The greatest talent. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3477.0s)]
*  Yeah, the greatest talent. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3478.0s)]
*  The greatest talent to step in the ring. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3479.0s)]
*  Just speed, but beyond speed. You know, when he would drop his hands and knock guys out, put his hands behind his back and knock guys out. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3481.0s)]
*  I mean, it was like his fights were executions. It was like Tyson in his prime. It was like you were waiting to see when Roy was going to take guys out. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3488.0s)]
*  But I think even freaker than Tyson for some reason. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3498.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3500.0s)]
*  Because those reflexes are just out of this fucking world. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3501.0s)]
*  Out of this fucking world. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3503.0s)]
*  Out of this world. People that weren't around when Roy was in his prime, I don't think they appreciate it. But man, we went up to heavyweight and beat Ruiz. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3504.0s)]
*  But then I think that's what fucked him. I think going up to heavyweight, he got up to like close to 200 pounds. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3512.0s)]
*  And then came back to 75 and he looked soft. It looked like he had just drained his body to make 75. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3518.0s)]
*  Then Tarver caught him and knocked him out. And then Glenn Johnson knocked him out after that. And he was just never the same. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3525.0s)]
*  Yeah, very true. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3530.0s)]
*  You wonder maybe if he didn't go to heavyweight. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3532.0s)]
*  Yeah. Maybe he stayed at light heavyweight. But that challenge to him. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3534.0s)]
*  He started at 154. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3540.0s)]
*  I know. Isn't that crazy? [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3541.0s)]
*  Beat James Toney too, which is another huge fan of James Toney. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3543.0s)]
*  Beat James Toney and hit him with that left hook. And James Toney was a defensive genius. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3546.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3549.0s)]
*  And the fact that he stood in front of him and just leaped in and dropped him with a left hook. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3550.0s)]
*  That's like a perfect example. James Toney had a fucking radar. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3554.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3558.0s)]
*  He was born with fucking a radar and he still couldn't see Roy Jones' speed in his prime, bro. It's crazy. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3559.0s)]
*  Yeah. His speed was like complete next level. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3565.0s)]
*  And it's interesting that he still enjoys fighting so much that he's still doing it. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3568.0s)]
*  I mean, he's in his 50s now. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3573.0s)]
*  I get updates from Royals send us videos and stuff. And this dude still has fucking crazy speed. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3575.0s)]
*  I would still place him slightly above average speed of most guys in boxing. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3581.0s)]
*  I know. It's crazy. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3587.0s)]
*  It's fucking nuts. And the last thing that leave a man is his power. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3588.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3591.0s)]
*  So I'm very interested in that. Obviously, there's a big age gap. Roy Jones is 54, 55. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3592.0s)]
*  Pettis is I think 30. He's a little younger than me. 34, 36, something like that. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3597.0s)]
*  So that's why I really like this matchup because Roy's got all this boxing experience. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3602.0s)]
*  But youth, as we know, is youth. You can pull off anything with youth. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3607.0s)]
*  That arrogance, that fucking, that bravado that youth brings. So I mean, fuck, bro. I'm pumped. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3611.0s)]
*  I'm pumped. I don't know who gets it, bro. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3616.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know who gets it either. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3619.0s)]
*  I'm leaning towards Roy, obviously conventional wisdom, but youth is youth, man. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3620.0s)]
*  Youth is youth. And Pettis can crack. He did fight lighter, you know, when you really think about it. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3625.0s)]
*  I mean, Pettis has fought at welterweight, which is 170 in boxing, 47. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3631.0s)]
*  But he fought at 170 and Roy was the best ever at 75. So it's, you know, it's interesting. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3636.0s)]
*  He was the best ever at 68, too. You know, I mean, at 68, he was the motherfucker. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3642.0s)]
*  I mean, fuck, bro. That speed is just, we could talk about it just the speed alone for hours. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3647.0s)]
*  Yeah, we should probably watch a Roy Jones highlight. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3653.0s)]
*  Put on a Roy Jones highlight reel because people that don't know, like these young kids today, like, oh, Roy Jones. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3655.0s)]
*  I saw him fight Mike Tyson. It was kind of boring. Like, listen, you need to go back into the hard guys. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3662.0s)]
*  If Roy Jones Jr. would have had social media when he was coming up, you're talking about 350 million followers. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3666.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3672.0s)]
*  Okay. Body shot, dead. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3673.0s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, my God. He was incredible. And just the speed. And you know, you ever seen his left arm? [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3676.0s)]
*  His left arm is twice the size of his right arm. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3684.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. And it has like a double bicep, it looked like. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3687.0s)]
*  It's crazy. He flexed. He flexed for me. I was like, what is going on? [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3689.0s)]
*  One arm is like literally like five inches bigger. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3693.0s)]
*  That's James Toney right there. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3696.0s)]
*  That's James Toney. He just, look at it. Oh, the Vinny Pazienza fight. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3697.0s)]
*  These were actually pretty good, man. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3701.0s)]
*  The Vinny Pazienza fight was the only fight in the history of CompuBox where the opponent landed zero punches in an entire round. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3703.0s)]
*  And Roy just fucking tuned him up and then begged the referee to stop it. He said the referee, come on, man, stop it. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3710.0s)]
*  And the ref's like, no, no, no. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3716.0s)]
*  I think the first one was kind of competitive, right? Was it? Because they fought twice? [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3717.0s)]
*  No, he never fought Vinny twice. He only fought Vinny once. He fucked Vinny up. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3720.0s)]
*  The Vinny Pazienza fight was a rout. Like Vinny had no business being in there with him. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3724.0s)]
*  I mean, Vinny started his career much lighter and Roy was bigger, faster, more talented, more skilled, more confident. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3728.0s)]
*  I mean, he was a freak of all freaks in his prime. Nobody was like him. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3736.0s)]
*  Captain Hook, boom. Captain Hook. He was amazing. Amazing. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3742.0s)]
*  I'm excited that you have him. I'm excited that he still enjoys competing, too. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3747.0s)]
*  It's fun. I mean, we haven't seen him since that Tyson fight, but the Tyson fight was very different. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3751.0s)]
*  Look at him staying in front of people. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3757.0s)]
*  That leaping right hand, I think, is one of the best right hands ever to grace boxing. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3760.0s)]
*  Also, his instincts and his fucking reflexes. They were off the charts. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3765.0s)]
*  The constant mind games is also what takes him to the next level, I think. Whoa, done. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3770.0s)]
*  God damn that speed. This is it. Hands behind the back, pop. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3775.0s)]
*  I mean, really, people. You know, he has that song. Y'all must have forgot. I never forgot. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3780.0s)]
*  I never forgot. I mean, I was a kid when he was coming up. And so, giant, giant Roy Jones Jr. fan. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3786.0s)]
*  I think all of us, especially me being from Florida, we were always like, this dude is everything. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3792.0s)]
*  Pensacola. Yeah, he put Florida on the map. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3797.0s)]
*  Do you think that Pettis is going to continue boxing? Does he still have a contract with the PFL? [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3801.0s)]
*  I know he has some works with the PFL. I don't know if he'll be doing the next season or not. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3806.0s)]
*  I don't know exactly the intricate details of that. But if he gets a win over Roy Jones, how does he not keep boxing? [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3812.0s)]
*  How does he not? I mean, the money's going to be there. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3819.0s)]
*  The money's going to be pouring. The guys right now, the older generation boxers, everybody's going to be calling his fucking name. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3821.0s)]
*  Everybody's going to want to fight him. And plus, Pettis himself is a fucking massive draw. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3827.0s)]
*  Of course. So it just makes sense that he continues boxing. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3831.0s)]
*  And I've heard him, and I've talked with him too, that he does want to kind of focus more on the striking and just like, [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3834.0s)]
*  you know, maybe not grapple so much and use the things that he's naturally gifted with, which is fucking his power and speed. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3840.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, he had gotten into wrestling quite a bit and it kind of like changed his game a little bit. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3846.0s)]
*  And then he realized, you know what? He's better when he's just a wild striker. And if you take him down, he submits you. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3851.0s)]
*  And it just kind of got away from that and went for a takedown defense. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3856.0s)]
*  But I think, was it Rafael Dos Angeles that he fought? We got manhandled? [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3860.0s)]
*  Oh, I think so. Might have been. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3864.0s)]
*  I think it was, let's see if we fought. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3867.0s)]
*  He's such a clutch dude though. Like when he won the title from Ben Henderson, you know about him? [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3869.0s)]
*  Oh my God, beautiful. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3874.0s)]
*  I fought with Ben. Ben is like no slouch in the grappling department. Gilbert Melendez, another guy that had never been submitted fucking guillotine. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3875.0s)]
*  It was just like, man, he was on fire for a fucking while. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3882.0s)]
*  So fast. He could get stuff off so fast. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3885.0s)]
*  Like a clutch dude, bro. Like the Thompson fight, he was getting murdered. Made it to go bang. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3888.0s)]
*  Catched him on the right hand and knocks him out. The only guy to knock out Wonderboy in MMA. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3895.0s)]
*  And then the way that he did it too. That's something too that why I love this matchup so much because in Roy you have like one of the flashiest fighters that had substance, not just flash. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3899.0s)]
*  And Pettis also, man, he's one of the best 155ers I think and also brought a lot of flash to the sport but had the substance behind it as well. So fireworks. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3908.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's exciting. How many? So here it is. Yeah, it was Hoffel Dos Anjos. Hoffel just manhandled him. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3917.0s)]
*  I mean, Hoffel was one of those guys that cut a shitload of weight to get to 55 and he was so fucking thick and such a good grappler and endurance. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3924.0s)]
*  Great kicking too. Good power with the hands. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3933.0s)]
*  Oh my God. Yeah, yeah. He's actually moving here. He's moving to Texas. Everybody's moving to Texas. They're all following you. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3936.0s)]
*  It's a fucking beautiful place to live. It's great. It's way, way cheaper than most of the country I think. No state taxes, nice people, great food, no traffic. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3943.0s)]
*  Protect yourself. Yeah, protect yourself at all times. I love it, man. That's nice. You don't have to worry about it. They have constitutional carry here. You don't even have to have concealed carry. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3953.0s)]
*  That's the best. We have, you got to get your permit in Florida, but Florida's pretty cool with the gun laws. It's not the craziest thing to get your little permit over there. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3961.0s)]
*  You can seal weapons permit. You could have it in the car. It just has to be like one or two steps away and you could have it in your house. You don't need like permission for that. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3970.0s)]
*  But to carry it, we do need permission to carry it in public. I think everybody should learn how to use a handgun correctly. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3977.0s)]
*  And if you could just get a gun and just carry it around, you don't know what the fuck you're doing. I don't like that. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3983.0s)]
*  I really feel like, I mean, I want to say it's mandatory because the Second Amendment is pretty clear. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3989.0s)]
*  You know, the right to keep and bear arms is a part of our rights. But I think just as a human being, you should learn how to use a gun correctly. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=3994.0s)]
*  You should learn how to handle it. You should learn safety. Just like a driver's license. Just like a driver's license. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4003.0s)]
*  You're going to get behind a car, it's a fucking weapon if you don't know what you're doing. You change somebody's life in a second. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4007.0s)]
*  Before they had that law here, I got a concealed carry permit. So I went through all the steps. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4013.0s)]
*  In California? [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4018.0s)]
*  Yeah, no here in Texas. California is hard. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4019.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's what everybody says. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4021.0s)]
*  They're loosening that up though in LA and the sheriff talked about it. He said there's too much fucking crime. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4023.0s)]
*  Too much fucking crime. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4028.0s)]
*  So they're loosening that up and giving away concealed carry permits now. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4029.0s)]
*  LA is a little scary, man. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4032.0s)]
*  It's very scary. My friends who go back there now, they're like, fuck man, it's just not the same place. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4033.0s)]
*  It was there like eight weeks ago. It's like zombie land now sometimes. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4038.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, COVID killed that place. COVID and the governor. The governor and the mayor, they just fucked that place to death. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4042.0s)]
*  I don't believe in those same policies that socialism and communism spring up. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4048.0s)]
*  Anything to do with that, I'm firmly against that and we see it. It's like a perfect example. You want to follow that shit. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4057.0s)]
*  Look what happened in California. Look what was going on in New York during the whole thing. It's nuts, man. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4062.0s)]
*  I get why people would think that it would work because they think they're going to be a better person. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4067.0s)]
*  We're going to make things fair for people. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4072.0s)]
*  But the problem is it just consolidates power in the top and then they leave everybody fighting over everything else and it becomes chaos. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4074.0s)]
*  It happens in every country. It happens in every city. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4082.0s)]
*  Whenever they institute those kind of policies, crime goes up. People get fucked. They let more people out of jail. Crime continues to go up. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4084.0s)]
*  Oh, you can't do that, man. I grew up in not the best neighborhoods. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4091.0s)]
*  Believe me, you don't want to defund the police. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4095.0s)]
*  No. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4098.0s)]
*  The people that will be alright is like me and you because I could hire a security team and so can you. But how about everybody else that can't? [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4099.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4106.0s)]
*  They're going to get fucking murked, bro. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4107.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4108.0s)]
*  Because there's people on the other side that are really fucking hungry, that are real, for real bad guys. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4109.0s)]
*  You take the police away, you take that filter away, you're asking for trouble, man. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4112.0s)]
*  And when you let bad guys out of jail and they know they're going to be able to get out of jail easy if something happens. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4116.0s)]
*  I mean, these guys are shooting people and they're out of jail on a day. It's crazy. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4122.0s)]
*  That's insane, bro. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4125.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4126.0s)]
*  There was some, I forget, I think it was California, like the dude went in for stabbing. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4127.0s)]
*  Then he got out the next day and then robbed up like a liquor store and then like shot somebody and killed somebody. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4131.0s)]
*  Like this guy was just in jail 24 hours ago and you fucking let him go, bro. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4136.0s)]
*  No, it's a mess. And you know, you've got that district attorney in LA. He's a monster. He just lets people out. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4139.0s)]
*  And just, I don't understand it. I don't understand these progressive district attorneys. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4145.0s)]
*  I think it's done on purpose. Because the evidence is pretty clear. It's like any idiot could read any black and white person. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4150.0s)]
*  It's in black and white for you to see like it's not working out, man. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4156.0s)]
*  Now what they're trying to do to our boy Trump is fucking nuts, bro. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4161.0s)]
*  They're talking about arresting him for paying a girl to stop talking about them having sex. I thought that was a good deal. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4164.0s)]
*  I thought it's a good deal. You pay someone. Didn't Clinton do that? [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4170.0s)]
*  Didn't John Edwards got in trouble for doing that? But he didn't go to jail. I don't believe he went to jail. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4173.0s)]
*  Bill Clinton got a blowjob while he was our president. While me and you are paying our tax dollars to these guys. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4178.0s)]
*  And that's the one that he got caught in. How much other shit do we not know about? [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4183.0s)]
*  Why isn't there no nothing on Bill Clinton, on him being on Jeffrey Epstein's fucking charter plane numerous times in the list? [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4187.0s)]
*  Yeah, 26 times. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4195.0s)]
*  But on the one dude, that's how you know that he's doing something right. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4197.0s)]
*  The one dude that's fighting for us, that's actually for the people, they want to crucify him. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4200.0s)]
*  They just don't want him president again. And they know that if he runs against Biden, Biden is so old. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4204.0s)]
*  No matter what you think about his policies, you hear him talk. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4209.0s)]
*  Can't even make it down a flight of stairs. He's so old. He's so compromised. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4214.0s)]
*  You watch him talk years ago. He was never an impressive guy. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4218.0s)]
*  Biden was never impressive when he was young because he was full bluster and he lied a lot about his record and his education background. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4221.0s)]
*  He lied about a bunch of things. He's a goofy old politician. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4228.0s)]
*  Career politician. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4232.0s)]
*  He's been in that lying business forever. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4234.0s)]
*  And the China money that he's been getting for years. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4237.0s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4240.0s)]
*  Hooking up his son. The computer denying the computer when it's like, bro, you could see it. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4241.0s)]
*  Before the FBI declared that this was real, I was already watching videos of him like, bro, how are you going to say this is not real? [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4245.0s)]
*  It's all over the fucking internet. Suppressed it before the election? [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4251.0s)]
*  Yeah, they suppressed it off of Twitter. And the fact that the liberals keep saying that there's nothing to that. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4254.0s)]
*  Like, what are you talking about? If that was Trump, if that was Trump and Donald Trump Jr. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4260.0s)]
*  was doing street crack with hookers in Vietnam and getting foot jobs. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4264.0s)]
*  And getting $10 million from these places when he's not equipped to have those type of jobs. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4268.0s)]
*  Yes, he was getting money from China and from Ukraine. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4274.0s)]
*  I mean, it's wild. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4277.0s)]
*  And those are the same people that he's given our tax dollars. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4280.0s)]
*  No offense to the people that are going through that in Ukraine. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4283.0s)]
*  Obviously, it sucks to be in war, especially against a massive thing like Russia. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4287.0s)]
*  But I don't think we should be poking our chest and they're starting possibly a World War III. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4293.0s)]
*  It's fucking terrifying. It's terrifying to me to the left, to the ones that are behind us encouraging it when the left was always anti-war. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4297.0s)]
*  That's what they say when a war from the other side happens. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4304.0s)]
*  We shouldn't be going to war, but that's the same thing they're going to do because that's when trillions of dollars get made every time we go to war. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4308.0s)]
*  Somebody's going to get rich. Maybe not me and you, but somebody's getting rich. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4314.0s)]
*  Exactly. That's really what's going on. Someone's getting rich. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4317.0s)]
*  What drives me the most crazy is the left is the one. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4319.0s)]
*  They're the ones that are always talking about equity and the communities that are disenfranchised. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4323.0s)]
*  Do you know how much money they could have spent fixing up places like Baltimore and Detroit? [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4329.0s)]
*  It could be a paradise. They don't care about any of those places. They don't. It's just a slogan. It's just bullshit. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4336.0s)]
*  It's the same thing that they did in Cuba literally in places like Venezuela. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4341.0s)]
*  In Cuba, they would come and tell the farmers, hey man, these city boys, this is the reason why you only have like one or two cows. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4345.0s)]
*  We need to all get together and go take their money and spread it around. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4352.0s)]
*  And then you know what they did once they came to power? [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4355.0s)]
*  They went to those same farmers and said, hey, you know these 10 cows that you got? Now they're part of the state. You're going to raise them. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4357.0s)]
*  And if you kill them, I'm going to put you in jail for 20 years. If you kill one of these cows, they're going to put tags on all of them. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4362.0s)]
*  And we're going to give you like 5% of that cow. And if you have a problem with it, we'll put you in jail and the next person will come. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4367.0s)]
*  So it's like kind of the same tactics they use here, divide and conquer. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4374.0s)]
*  Constant, you know, because they know if we unite as a people and like, hey man, Trump was doing the right thing. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4378.0s)]
*  We might not like him on Twitter. He might be a mean coach, but fuck he wins titles. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4384.0s)]
*  Constant. If we could do that, I mean, fuck America, I'll be right back to being great again. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4390.0s)]
*  You know, right now what's going on with the banks? I'm hearing all types of crazy shit. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4395.0s)]
*  We all like, I hear these crazy reports. I read these reports that I forgot the exact percentage. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4399.0s)]
*  But if a certain percentage of people right now were to pull out their money, banks are collapsed. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4405.0s)]
*  There's 200 banks that are apparently in danger. This is what I read. Is this the case? [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4410.0s)]
*  I hope it ain't mine. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4414.0s)]
*  You've been paying attention a little bit, right? [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4415.0s)]
*  Yeah, if I start looking too deep, it sounds like the whole fucking thing is really about to just fall apart. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4417.0s)]
*  But like, I'm like, okay. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4422.0s)]
*  I knew it was bad when one of the heads of my bank sent me a message. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4424.0s)]
*  Hey, I just want to send you a message. Everything is good here. We're well taken care of. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4430.0s)]
*  You got nothing to worry about. Your money's in a safe place. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4434.0s)]
*  You're like, oh my God, let me get my money now. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4436.0s)]
*  I called him right away and I told him, hey bro, do me a favor. Would you tell me if it wasn't good though? [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4438.0s)]
*  You're going to tell me that? He's like, no, of course I would. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4444.0s)]
*  I mean, no, you wouldn't, man. Come take your money out now before we go broke. You're not going to tell me that. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4447.0s)]
*  Maybe we do it to you because you might fuck him up. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4451.0s)]
*  I might fuck him up, man. But damn, it's a scary time we're living in, bro. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4453.0s)]
*  It's scary because I think a lot of these banks, I mean, it's kind of funky. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4458.0s)]
*  It's like if you just take all the money out, they're fucked. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4464.0s)]
*  And if people panic and they take all the money out and then those banks are fucked and then it starts to cascade. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4467.0s)]
*  It could collapse the economy right now, me and you, with this conversation. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4472.0s)]
*  Well, if you let too many people know what's going on, it could collapse the economy. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4474.0s)]
*  If you let too many people panic, if someone decided, like some financial expert, not a moron like me, but someone who's a legitimate financial expert. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4478.0s)]
*  Elon Musk says, get your money out now. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4486.0s)]
*  Oh my God. If Elon Musk got on Twitter and said, get your money out now, invest in gold, invest in Bitcoin, do something else, people would fucking panic. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4488.0s)]
*  I mean, you're fighting at the FTX arena, which is wild. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4498.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, Miami data arena now. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4502.0s)]
*  It still says FTX on my contract. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4504.0s)]
*  FTX arena, bro. That's a fucking awesome one. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4507.0s)]
*  And then how many billions of dollars did they give to, millions, not billions, did they give to Democratic Party? [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4511.0s)]
*  The number two donor to the Democratic Party. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4518.0s)]
*  That's not like money laundering. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4521.0s)]
*  It seems a little bit like money laundering. It's like a legal version of money laundering. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4522.0s)]
*  That's not money laundering. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4527.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, listen, man, he thought that that was the way he was going to avoid going to jail and avoid scrutiny. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4528.0s)]
*  Just keep shuffling out that money. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4533.0s)]
*  He wanted to donate a billion dollars next year. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4536.0s)]
*  He wanted to continue donating money. And he was donating money from the people that put the money into that exchange. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4538.0s)]
*  He was taking other people's money and donating it. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4544.0s)]
*  What's going on with him now? Is he facing like 20 life sentences? [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4546.0s)]
*  He's fucked. They're going to make an example of that, dude. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4549.0s)]
*  The CEO who looked at it, again, I don't understand it. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4553.0s)]
*  So I have to just go off what I've read. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4558.0s)]
*  And what I've read is the CEO went over and he said, this is just old school fraud. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4560.0s)]
*  This is nothing but fraud. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4566.0s)]
*  This is fraud under a new type of money under crypto. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4568.0s)]
*  But he goes, but this is just straight fraud. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4572.0s)]
*  And he untangled all of it. The CEO has been untangling all the books. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4575.0s)]
*  You know, they used QuickBooks to do their taxes. QuickBooks. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4579.0s)]
*  Like some shit that a guy who runs a corner store would use. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4583.0s)]
*  A billion dollars exchange. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4587.0s)]
*  These guys are saving some pennies there, huh? [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4589.0s)]
*  They were all on amphetamines and they were all fucking each other in that house. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4591.0s)]
*  Part of me is kind of rooting for them. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4596.0s)]
*  If they weren't doing fraud, you got all these nerds that are just, there's nine of them living in a house and they're all just having orgies and fucking each other on speed. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4598.0s)]
*  They're all taking speed and ecstasy and banging each other. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4606.0s)]
*  They don't even look good. No one's even hot. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4610.0s)]
*  They're just closing their eyes and watching video games and fucking each other. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4613.0s)]
*  I mean, it's crazy. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4617.0s)]
*  Just bought some fucking island in the Bahamas and went to town on each other. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4618.0s)]
*  Bought a giant ass penthouse, a 40 million dollar penthouse at the top of this building with the most amazing view. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4621.0s)]
*  They gotta make a movie on these guys. They gotta make a movie on these fuckers, bro. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4627.0s)]
*  They should. Yeah. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4629.0s)]
*  Yeah, it should be a real, a good one, like an Oliver Stone movie where they really go deep into what was actually going on and just show the grittiness of it. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4630.0s)]
*  And all the people that are killing themselves because they lost all their money. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4638.0s)]
*  And that's what people don't talk about. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4641.0s)]
*  It's like people commit suicide all the time when these things happen. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4643.0s)]
*  You've got a billion dollars locked up in crypto and now all of a sudden you're broke. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4646.0s)]
*  Broke as fuck. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4650.0s)]
*  And no way to get that money back. It's impossible. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4651.0s)]
*  It's gone forever. It didn't exist in the first place. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4654.0s)]
*  It was all a Ponzi scheme. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4656.0s)]
*  And now you're insolvent. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4658.0s)]
*  It makes you really rethink everything because I might know a little bit about money, but what do I know compared to a fucking billionaire? [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4659.0s)]
*  Somebody that's made his money. I made my money out of fighting, not because I'm the greatest businessman. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4670.0s)]
*  You got these great businessmen to give you a fucking billion dollars. What the fuck's going on here? [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4675.0s)]
*  I know. That's what's wild. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4679.0s)]
*  What's that by dreaming what you're selling? [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4681.0s)]
*  They knew money. They understood money. They understood the whole thing. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4682.0s)]
*  And they dumped shitloads of money into that exchange. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4685.0s)]
*  Well, maybe if you dumped a bunch of money, they let you come to the orgy fentanyl parties or something. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4688.0s)]
*  Must have been, right? Like you sign here, listen, guaranteeing you three orgy fentanyl parties a month, you're set. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4692.0s)]
*  I don't think anybody wanted to go to those parties. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4698.0s)]
*  There's a bunch of doughy looking nerds banging each other. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4700.0s)]
*  I mean, it's just the whole thing is crazy. It doesn't even seem real. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4703.0s)]
*  The fact that everyone knew that they were having these orgies, that girl Caroline Ellison, she was talking on Twitter. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4708.0s)]
*  Is that the one with the glasses? [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4715.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, she was the one he was banging, which is hilarious. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4716.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4720.0s)]
*  Ever see Tim Dillon's take on that? You know who Tim Dillon is? [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4721.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4723.0s)]
*  Tim Dillon's hilarious. He did his whole... [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4724.0s)]
*  I didn't see his take on her by no who Tim. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4726.0s)]
*  See if you can find it. Tim Dillon on Caroline Ellison and Sam Bankman Fried, he did his fucking... [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4729.0s)]
*  About what kind of money? Let's see what kind of pussy $10 billion gets you. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4737.0s)]
*  I want to know. I want to see what it gets you. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4743.0s)]
*  I've seen that too. It's like you got to pay most of us some serious cash to like... [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4748.0s)]
*  Yeah, just to do it. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4753.0s)]
*  But meanwhile, they're billionaires and these are the people that are fucking each other. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4755.0s)]
*  Who are we to judge? Maybe she had like a golden snatch. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4759.0s)]
*  Must have. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4761.0s)]
*  Like $10 billion snatch. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4762.0s)]
*  Yeah. That's real. All snatchers are not created equal. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4764.0s)]
*  No. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4768.0s)]
*  Some of them are better. That's a fact. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4769.0s)]
*  Yeah. A lot better. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4770.0s)]
*  A lot better. Like you're like, oh my God, what's going on in that one? [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4772.0s)]
*  Make you short circuit. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4776.0s)]
*  Yeah. Where you panic and start breathing heavy like, I got to fucking concentrate myself. Here it goes. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4777.0s)]
*  This girl has flipped on him, by the way. Can we get a picture of this woman up? [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4785.0s)]
*  Because this is why you do it, right? For the puss. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4788.0s)]
*  What is $32 billion buying to market a pussy? [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4790.0s)]
*  I don't like pussy. I don't even know. I could get a real cock for $36 billion. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4792.0s)]
*  You know the cock that I could get? Let's get a picture of this hottie up. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4798.0s)]
*  What is the straight market get you for... [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4801.0s)]
*  Yep. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4807.0s)]
*  Sam, Sam, Sam. Sam, Sam, Sam. Evading U.S. regulators, this is what it was for? [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4808.0s)]
*  People will be like, well, you're making fun of the way a woman looks. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4824.0s)]
*  Okay, but they're criminals who stole everyone's money. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4826.0s)]
*  Okay. So maybe that... Is that okay? That I make fun of them now? [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4829.0s)]
*  It's a fun time to be a comedian. There's so much ridiculous shit going on. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4838.0s)]
*  It's like the whole world has gone topsy-turvy and nobody knows what's going to right the ship. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4842.0s)]
*  We're all worried. We're all worried about war with Ukraine. The banks are going to fail. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4847.0s)]
*  The fucking climate, this, that, the other thing, the fucking borders, porous. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4851.0s)]
*  People are pouring in, including terrorists. They're catching people on the terrorist watch list every day, sneaking in through Mexico. It's crazy. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4855.0s)]
*  Kamala Harris is yet to still visit the southern border? [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4864.0s)]
*  I don't know if she's visited it, but she doesn't talk too much about it. When she does talk, it's just this rambling weird... [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4867.0s)]
*  She's talking to the kindergarteners, of course. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4872.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think she's medicated. I don't know if she is, but I've read this guy that was examining the way she talks and behaves, [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4874.0s)]
*  and he said that it's classic for someone who's on anti-anxiety medications. I don't know if he's telling the truth. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4881.0s)]
*  I don't know if he's right, but it's like the whole thing freaks me out. It freaks me out because, you know, if Biden dies, which is very possible, I mean, he's... [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4886.0s)]
*  Did you see that in Ukraine? Somebody slid all the way down the stairs. Maybe it could have been Biden. Did you see that video? [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4895.0s)]
*  It was outside on a couple pages on Instagram. Air Force One lands in Ukraine. Somebody falls off the stairs. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4903.0s)]
*  And if it would have been Biden, I think he would have died. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4909.0s)]
*  He would have died. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4911.0s)]
*  They slid down the rails, like slid down the rails, and then Secret Service caught them at the bottom. It's a fucking crazy video. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4912.0s)]
*  I haven't seen that. Who was it? [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4918.0s)]
*  This dude that I follow... [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4920.0s)]
*  I've never seen this too. I thought it was Biden too, but they never said who it was. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4922.0s)]
*  Do you want to see it? [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4925.0s)]
*  I'm trying to find the right video. It's... [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4926.0s)]
*  He falls all the time. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4928.0s)]
*  He falls riding a bike. He falls going upstairs. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4930.0s)]
*  This was different though. This is like, oh, he's going to die, and then they caught him. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4933.0s)]
*  It's from a far away angle. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4936.0s)]
*  Yeah, look at that. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4937.0s)]
*  Oh, Jesus Christ. Who is that? [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4938.0s)]
*  Hard to say. It's in a group of people. There's a lot of stairs. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4940.0s)]
*  Whoop. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4946.0s)]
*  Slippin' slide. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4947.0s)]
*  It's fucking... [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4948.0s)]
*  Dude was in a rush. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4951.0s)]
*  Oh my God. Who is it? [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4952.0s)]
*  I don't think they've ever said that. Not that I've ever heard. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4954.0s)]
*  Oh, it's Biden. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4956.0s)]
*  He came down separately by himself, I believe, on this particular moment. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4957.0s)]
*  Oh, so it wasn't him. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4960.0s)]
*  So it wasn't him. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4961.0s)]
*  Is what I heard. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4962.0s)]
*  Bro, he probably had a death grip on that rail. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4963.0s)]
*  Why doesn't he just have an elevator? [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4965.0s)]
*  I don't think he can get an elevator on a plane. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4967.0s)]
*  But someone, for sure... [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4970.0s)]
*  They gotta have some type of rig for this dude, man. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4972.0s)]
*  They should have someone in front of him, some big dude with good balance. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4974.0s)]
*  Yeah, but then imagine how weak it also makes him. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4977.0s)]
*  Look, you can't even walk down these stairs by yourself and you're running the greatest country in the world. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4979.0s)]
*  Probably falls going up the stairs. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4983.0s)]
*  First of all, he should not be wearing slippery shoes. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4985.0s)]
*  He should not be wearing those dress shoes. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4988.0s)]
*  Don't do that. Those things are slippery for regular people. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4990.0s)]
*  For a dude, his body's short-circuiting. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4993.0s)]
*  It's just not... [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4995.0s)]
*  Constant. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4996.0s)]
*  Constant. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4997.0s)]
*  I mean, what have they got him on to keep him going, too? [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=4998.0s)]
*  I would like to get on that cocktail. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5001.0s)]
*  I would like to get on that cocktail. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5003.0s)]
*  His pupils, his eyes just don't seem like regular either. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5004.0s)]
*  When he's talking and stuff, it's... [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5007.0s)]
*  It's probably Adderall. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5009.0s)]
*  They probably got... [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5010.0s)]
*  Nah, nah, nah. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5011.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5012.0s)]
*  Adderall's what me and Yuki get. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5013.0s)]
*  They're giving him something else, bro. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5014.0s)]
*  See that photo of him going around? [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5015.0s)]
*  It must have been taken as he was sort of coming down the stairs a little hard. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5017.0s)]
*  Whoops. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5020.0s)]
*  But it's a weird position for him to be in. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5021.0s)]
*  Bro, that's not good for old knees. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5022.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5024.0s)]
*  They blow those knees out. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5025.0s)]
*  They're joking. He was moshing. He was moshing. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5026.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's getting crazy. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5028.0s)]
*  Ray Janssen Machines playing. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5029.0s)]
*  Fuck you, I won't do what you tell me. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5032.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a wild time to be alive, man. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5039.0s)]
*  It's a strange... [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5041.0s)]
*  It's a time that could lead to terrible things or we could come out of this better. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5043.0s)]
*  Look, all around the world, though, it's only led to terrible things in the world. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5049.0s)]
*  I always have felt that, especially from hearing it from my dad, that escaped communism at an early age. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5052.0s)]
*  He brought himself on over in a raft, landed in the Bahamas. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5058.0s)]
*  Your dad came from Cuba? [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5061.0s)]
*  Came from Cuba. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5062.0s)]
*  When he was 14, 15 years old, him and his best friend and his best friend's uncle came over to plan that they were going to escape. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5063.0s)]
*  So they found a tire tractor, turned it into a raft, hit the sea. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5069.0s)]
*  Seven days later, he landed to the Bahamas. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5072.0s)]
*  From the Bahamas, he got extradited to the USA, straight to the projects, and began his journey here in America. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5074.0s)]
*  So he always would tell me, sorry about that. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5079.0s)]
*  No worries. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5083.0s)]
*  All my friends that have family that has come from a communist country, I have some friends that came from Eastern Bloc countries, [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5084.0s)]
*  I have friends that came from Venezuela, I have friends that have come from Cuba. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5091.0s)]
*  Joey does not want to hear any of that shit. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5095.0s)]
*  You try to say that to Joey Diaz? [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5098.0s)]
*  None of us. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5099.0s)]
*  This fucking shit always goes bad. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5100.0s)]
*  Always. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5102.0s)]
*  Shout out to Joey, bro. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5103.0s)]
*  He's one of the fucking coolest dudes I've ever met. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5104.0s)]
*  He's the best. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5106.0s)]
*  Joey Diaz is the funniest fucking human being I've ever met in my life. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5107.0s)]
*  But he has nothing good to say about that. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5109.0s)]
*  Nothing. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5111.0s)]
*  Nobody actually lived there. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5112.0s)]
*  That's what I see. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5113.0s)]
*  Like Kaepernick, he went to Miami and had a fucking Che Guevara shirt. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5114.0s)]
*  This dude slaughtered fucking thousands of people, family of mine, friends of my family, just to take power. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5118.0s)]
*  This guy was so fucked up that he had the wall removed from his own office so he could see the firing squad eliminating people. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5126.0s)]
*  And these are the people he put on t-shirts. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5132.0s)]
*  And if you believe in them so much, like any of these guys that advocate for socialism or communism, go live over there, dog. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5134.0s)]
*  Just one year, I dare you, bro. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5139.0s)]
*  I fucking dare you, bro, because you wouldn't make it one day over there, Kaepernick or any of these fucks, advocating for socialism, communism. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5141.0s)]
*  And what I was saying earlier is that look all over the world, Venezuela, Brazil, Colombia, Ukraine. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5148.0s)]
*  It's like gotten bad overnight. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5157.0s)]
*  And what used to be the standard of fighting communism, socialism, is now somewhat semi-adapted in this country. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5159.0s)]
*  Progressive socialism, or what are they calling? [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5167.0s)]
*  Yeah, they call it democratic socialism. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5169.0s)]
*  Democratic socialism? Get the fuck out of here with that, bro. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5171.0s)]
*  They think that they're going to be able to do it the right way. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5173.0s)]
*  It's never been done the right way. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5177.0s)]
*  But they all understand that that kind of thing always leads to top-down power. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5179.0s)]
*  It always leads to dictatorships. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5183.0s)]
*  It always leads to someone enforcing. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5184.0s)]
*  And those people always have castles and fucking billions of dollars and everybody lives in poverty. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5186.0s)]
*  The only thing that's promising in communism and socialism is equal misery for everybody else, except the fucking elite of elite. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5193.0s)]
*  And these people out there might be listening like, oh, I'm a billionaire or a millionaire. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5199.0s)]
*  No, you're not the elite. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5204.0s)]
*  So it's a different fucking power structure for those guys that most of us ain't going to fucking ever get to come around. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5206.0s)]
*  And that's just for them. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5214.0s)]
*  Like California, perfect example. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5216.0s)]
*  What happens when you adopt these fucking shit policies, bro, in a great country like ours? [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5218.0s)]
*  I think 1000 percent we are the beacon of light for the whole world. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5222.0s)]
*  When we're doing good, the whole world is fucking doing good. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5226.0s)]
*  When we're fighting against that shit, that fucking pure evil, the whole world is doing better. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5229.0s)]
*  And look how good we were doing with Trump just like two, three years ago. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5233.0s)]
*  Fucking this wannabe president took over now. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5236.0s)]
*  The whole world's gotten to shit real fucking quick. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5239.0s)]
*  Look at China, Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, all this shit. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5242.0s)]
*  I don't think none of this would have happened if Trump was in power, brother. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5245.0s)]
*  I fucking seriously believe that. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5247.0s)]
*  It probably would have been much different for sure. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5249.0s)]
*  And if we could get sensible policies and a sensible, like someone who's fiscally conservative to take over these states and put them back on track, it would be better for everybody. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5251.0s)]
*  That's what people don't understand. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5262.0s)]
*  It's better for the poor people. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5264.0s)]
*  It's better for more jobs. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5265.0s)]
*  When the economy is doing better, everybody does better. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5267.0s)]
*  Small government. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5269.0s)]
*  Yeah, man. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5270.0s)]
*  Never give them the power. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5272.0s)]
*  Never give them the fucking power. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5273.0s)]
*  But it's so hard for people to wrap their head around that because they think that socialism is like a more equitable, fair way to live life. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5274.0s)]
*  It's not. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5281.0s)]
*  They just think it because they don't have any money. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5282.0s)]
*  They don't understand that the people that do have money, they are manipulating you. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5284.0s)]
*  The whole thing is manipulation and it's top down manipulation. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5288.0s)]
*  And once they get complete control, if they get something like some sort of a social credit score system and a digital currency, we're fucked. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5292.0s)]
*  Like China? [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5299.0s)]
*  Like China, exactly. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5300.0s)]
*  You won't be able to, if you tweet something that they don't like, you won't be able to... [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5301.0s)]
*  You can't catch that fast train no more. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5305.0s)]
*  No, no. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5306.0s)]
*  No, it takes you two, three days to get to that side of the country. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5307.0s)]
*  They'll punish you. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5309.0s)]
*  And they'll punish you so you will self-censor. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5310.0s)]
*  And you will step in line, you will stand in line, you will be one of the people that's subjugated. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5313.0s)]
*  And there's no ifs, ands, or buts about it. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5318.0s)]
*  That's how it always works. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5320.0s)]
*  And the people that want to point to it being the way we should live, there's no successful version of it. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5322.0s)]
*  No one can say this is how socialism works when it's perfect. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5328.0s)]
*  200 million souls and counting in the socialism, communism experiment. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5331.0s)]
*  It's never worked once. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5336.0s)]
*  Why would we take the chance with the country that's the greatest in the world and if it ain't broke, don't fix it. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5337.0s)]
*  Could we be better? [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5344.0s)]
*  Fuck yeah, we could be better. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5345.0s)]
*  But I've been all over the world just as I'm sure you've traveled the world 20 times over me. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5346.0s)]
*  And I truly feel in my heart this is the greatest country. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5350.0s)]
*  I'm a son of two immigrants, speaks that didn't have shit. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5354.0s)]
*  My dad landed on a fucking raft. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5357.0s)]
*  My mom came from Peru and didn't have fucking a dollar. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5359.0s)]
*  She was like the first one to get here, escaping the socialism over there to an extent. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5361.0s)]
*  It wasn't as bad as Cuba. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5365.0s)]
*  And I'm a multimillionaire, bro, just for doing my passion, my love, something that I fucking love in my heart. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5367.0s)]
*  And I'm taking care of my family, my family's family. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5373.0s)]
*  And a couple generations down, I'm going to be able to fucking contribute to them. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5377.0s)]
*  Sorry about that. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5381.0s)]
*  No worries. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5382.0s)]
*  I keep shutting down. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5383.0s)]
*  Popular dude. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5384.0s)]
*  No, no, no. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5385.0s)]
*  It's actually my fucking wake up from my nap alarm. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5386.0s)]
*  You got naps incorporated into your day? [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5392.0s)]
*  Not always, but just in case. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5394.0s)]
*  Every now and then, sleep. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5397.0s)]
*  Yeah, every now and then, a little sleep. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5398.0s)]
*  Not too much though. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5400.0s)]
*  Have you changed as you've gotten older, have you changed your workout routine? [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5401.0s)]
*  Have you done anything? [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5405.0s)]
*  Yes, no. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5407.0s)]
*  Yes, no. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5408.0s)]
*  So one thing I like to do is obviously shock my body, but I also like to get long training sessions in. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5410.0s)]
*  I remember Bernard Hopkins would talk about it a lot, where he would just do the basics for a very, very long time and just doing it. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5419.0s)]
*  And it's very boring and monotonous just for me to just throw one jab, one jab, one jab constantly, things like that. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5425.0s)]
*  But I feel that it just like re-sparks maybe things that I should be sharpening up. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5432.0s)]
*  And it becomes cardio at some point. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5437.0s)]
*  I'm doing it for so long, it becomes cardio, it becomes specific cardio to what I'm doing. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5439.0s)]
*  So a lot of my sessions, I'll have like a two to three hour session first thing in the morning when I'm nice and strong and I have the fucking full gas tank. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5443.0s)]
*  Then I'll take my little break and then I'll have like another session at night. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5451.0s)]
*  But it's not always like that. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5454.0s)]
*  Sometimes when I don't have a fight, I'll do three sessions a day, but they won't be like crazy. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5455.0s)]
*  It'll be maybe a strength and conditioning that lasted about 45 minutes to an hour and 15. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5460.0s)]
*  And I took a big break. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5464.0s)]
*  Then I came back in the midday, had like a good technique session where I'm just focused on positions that I'm not efficient and just doing them over and over and over. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5465.0s)]
*  And I used to do a lot more live mixing with drilling. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5474.0s)]
*  I've always been a big driller just because I'm not for grappling. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5478.0s)]
*  Striking is different. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5482.0s)]
*  Coach showed it to me two, three times and I understand that the biomechanics really will. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5483.0s)]
*  Grappling has never come to me like that. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5487.0s)]
*  So I have to like get numerous repetitions. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5489.0s)]
*  So in that I'm doing my cardio. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5492.0s)]
*  I'm getting better at my craft. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5494.0s)]
*  So I just like to fucking to train and just put the time in there. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5496.0s)]
*  So when I was younger, I trained hard like twice a day, but always didn't have like a direction. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5500.0s)]
*  Now I have like a clear direction. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5506.0s)]
*  I'm just trying to focus on making this guillotine more efficient or whatever it is that I'm doing. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5507.0s)]
*  So I'm just going to get numerous reps. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5512.0s)]
*  I'll spend numerous time with Mike Brown or Paulino Hernandez, whoever is leading the practice. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5514.0s)]
*  They know that I'm also like very ADD and dumb. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5519.0s)]
*  I can't learn more than like one to two moves a day or like even the setup. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5522.0s)]
*  Just teach me two to three things and I'm just going to drill that for like an hour, hour and a half and I'll be done. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5525.0s)]
*  Are you monitoring your heart rate to make sure you're not over training? [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5530.0s)]
*  Are you doing shit like that? [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5535.0s)]
*  I was definitely doing that and then with whoop and stuff. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5536.0s)]
*  But I was like, man, this comes from China, man. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5540.0s)]
*  No, I'm not even joking. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5543.0s)]
*  I'm not even joking. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5545.0s)]
*  I was like these Chinese motherfuckers are monitoring my sleep, my everything. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5546.0s)]
*  And I was like, nah, bro, I can't do this shit anymore. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5549.0s)]
*  And then, you know, a lot of times I'm just like mind over matter. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5552.0s)]
*  Like I wake up feeling like a little, I don't feel great this and then the whoop tells me hey or whatever technology. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5556.0s)]
*  I'm not trying to dis on whoop or nothing or whatever technology I was using like, hey, you know, today should be like a half day. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5563.0s)]
*  But in the back of my mind, I'm like, should it be? [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5569.0s)]
*  I feel like if I really like start to warm up and start to dig and I got somebody in front of me that's mean and trying to come after me wrong and find it and then I'm fighting just in case I wake up not feeling the best who gives a fuck. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5572.0s)]
*  I got to fight. You know, I got to compete. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5583.0s)]
*  So I like them and I don't for like workouts. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5585.0s)]
*  I like them. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5587.0s)]
*  But for them to tell me like today, take it like a half day off. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5588.0s)]
*  It's kind of like I've been doing this so long. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5591.0s)]
*  I also know my body's like the difference between an injury and just being like truly sore, maybe having like a little pain somewhere. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5593.0s)]
*  I just I just really listen to my body. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5600.0s)]
*  I did the modern for like a good six to eight months. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5602.0s)]
*  And I think it's a great tool. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5605.0s)]
*  I think individuals should definitely use it. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5608.0s)]
*  But combat sports is like this special weird fucking thing. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5610.0s)]
*  If maybe if I was a triathlete would make a lot more scientific sense. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5613.0s)]
*  But in combat, it's like you got to test the mind to test. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5616.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5620.0s)]
*  And sometimes when you're not doing that well physically, the mind gets you through it. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5621.0s)]
*  Yeah. You got to know that it's always there in your body. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5626.0s)]
*  Like on when I used to cut a lot of weight at one hundred and fifty five pounds, it was constant running from years three to five miles every day to every other day. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5629.0s)]
*  And then as I got closer to the fight, which is a constant thing, so I had my two hour long session in the morning, sparring, whatever. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5638.0s)]
*  And then I would do pads at night. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5644.0s)]
*  Then I go home, have like a little protein shake and go run. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5646.0s)]
*  And then there's truly where I discovered myself because I didn't really fucking want to do these runs to be like a five mile run. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5648.0s)]
*  I'm like, I don't think I could do a half a mile. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5654.0s)]
*  And just putting on my socks, going through that mentally. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5657.0s)]
*  And then I put on my shoes and the next step, I'm out the door. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5661.0s)]
*  Then before I know it, I did these five miles and those things led me to believe we're always going to have breaks, sensors put on us like, oh, that's it. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5663.0s)]
*  Can't go no more. But when you really want something, when you really like, fuck it, I'll just pass out on the street and I don't give a fuck. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5671.0s)]
*  But I'm going to get this done. Shit happens, bro. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5677.0s)]
*  Yeah. And you just like evolve, bro. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5679.0s)]
*  It's the power of the mind. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5681.0s)]
*  It's like some people, they have this ability to push like David Goggins is the best example. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5684.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Another fucking dude that I love to listen to. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5689.0s)]
*  You just hear him talking, you get fucking goosebumps. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5691.0s)]
*  Whenever I'm around him, man, I'm like, he's an extraordinary human being. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5693.0s)]
*  Like, do you know his knees are destroyed? His knees are so fucked up. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5697.0s)]
*  The doctor, when they examined his knee said, I can't believe you could walk. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5702.0s)]
*  Yeah. He goes, forget about running thousands of miles. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5705.0s)]
*  How the fuck are you walking on these knees? [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5710.0s)]
*  His knees are bone on bone. And he got his knee cut because his knee had grown. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5712.0s)]
*  Like the bone had distorted because it was just bone on bone and inflamed. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5719.0s)]
*  So he had to get it cut, sliced and wedged and then screwed in place. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5724.0s)]
*  So it was flat. Fucking mutant. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5730.0s)]
*  So it's still bone on bone. But at least now it's flat. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5732.0s)]
*  So he doesn't like put all the weight on one side of his knee. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5736.0s)]
*  But if you see like his knee, like show the picture of the injury, it's so fucking crazy that you can't imagine that this guy would do this. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5740.0s)]
*  And I mean, he really needs knee replacements and he probably will have to get them someday. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5750.0s)]
*  But some stem cell, at least some. Something. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5755.0s)]
*  The stem cell helped me out tremendously. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5757.0s)]
*  When I used to do a lot of road work, the pounding was like fucking you wake up and you just have the pain. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5759.0s)]
*  I just ran five miles on the night before I wake up and I feel like shit. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5764.0s)]
*  Yeah. So see that marking? That's because the edema in his legs and that picture of being him together. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5767.0s)]
*  That's what his knee looks like. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5773.0s)]
*  So they sliced his knee like at an angle and then took a chunk of it out and then moved it down so that it's flat. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5774.0s)]
*  But if you look at his knee, there's no space. There's no meniscus. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5782.0s)]
*  There's no cartilage. That is fucking straight bone on bone. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5785.0s)]
*  And that dude is running, you know, 25, 30 miles a day. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5789.0s)]
*  At a crazy pace. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5793.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Out there talking shit. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5794.0s)]
*  Stay hard! Just running in agony. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5796.0s)]
*  Like he says when he stands, he's in agony. When he walks around, he's in agony. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5799.0s)]
*  He's always in pain, but you would never notice. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5802.0s)]
*  He just keeps moving. It's wild. It's wild. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5805.0s)]
*  And that kind of mental strength, that dude, he's like a dispensary for mental strength. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5809.0s)]
*  You hear him talk and all of a sudden you find a new gear. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5815.0s)]
*  And then you watch him do it, which is even more, you know, I love the motivational speakers, [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5818.0s)]
*  but there's nothing more motivation to me than coach just said, hey, we're going to run five hard miles. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5822.0s)]
*  And he's fucking running it there and he's ahead of us. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5827.0s)]
*  I'm like, man, how the fuck is this old motherfucker in front of me? [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5829.0s)]
*  I got to push, you know, I got to fucking get after. I'm the one that's competing. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5831.0s)]
*  That's why I fucking hats off to Goggins always, bro. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5834.0s)]
*  Hats off to him. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5837.0s)]
*  That, I think that is the benefit, like what you just described of a big camp, [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5838.0s)]
*  because a big, like ATT has so many fucking killers that you are just constantly around these assassins. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5843.0s)]
*  On a daily basis. And it's just, it is a dog pit. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5851.0s)]
*  And if you're not a dog and you get in there, like you'll find out real quick and you'll know where you stand in the world. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5856.0s)]
*  And it took us a while to get there, man, to become like a refined. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5864.0s)]
*  Shout out to Dan Lambert. Dan Lambert's a fucking man. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5869.0s)]
*  He spent so much goddamn money putting ATT together back in the day where there was very little money in the sport. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5872.0s)]
*  Just out of love. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5880.0s)]
*  And still does. You know, still puts, you know, this is stuff you won't ever hear from Dan's mouth, [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5881.0s)]
*  but this is stuff that I know personally, he'll fucking probably like punch me in the leg for saying things, [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5886.0s)]
*  but he's constantly helping dudes out. Whatever. Rent came up short. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5891.0s)]
*  You have a surgery and it's not getting covered because this promotion that you're at doesn't have that. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5895.0s)]
*  Okay, here you go, bro. Here's fucking XYZ dollars. It's just, he's not like your typical dude, man. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5899.0s)]
*  He's a fucking good dude through and through transparent as fuck. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5906.0s)]
*  What you see is what you get. And back then when you put the program together, like you said, there was like no money, man. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5909.0s)]
*  This guy has the pockets to own like a football team or something. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5914.0s)]
*  This is what he loves. He fucking loves MMA, you know, and put a great program together. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5918.0s)]
*  Back then, though, it was some while. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5924.0s)]
*  So I wish you could have gave me the American top team back then when it was like sparring was just like a fight [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5926.0s)]
*  because we had adopted something where, you know, we knew that in boxing, you just spar hard, you know, [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5930.0s)]
*  you don't always sparring boxing, but once that camp is up eight weeks out, they're fucking those guys throwing heaters to see where they're at. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5935.0s)]
*  You know, so ATT used to be like that. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5942.0s)]
*  And it was like a constant amount of bodies everywhere. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5945.0s)]
*  Now we've got a more sophisticated coaches that got him better where we still get after it hard, but in a much more scientific way. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5948.0s)]
*  And fuck, I'm just I'm eager to see what the future brings. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5955.0s)]
*  Like long after I retire, I think that we're still going to hold the fucking flag up for mixed martial arts. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5958.0s)]
*  Well, it's an incredible camp. And, you know, it's it's filled. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5964.0s)]
*  The guys we've got coming up right now. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5968.0s)]
*  Guys like Eblen, like Johnny, who's... [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5971.0s)]
*  You're soft to the Bellator champion. Oh, yeah. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5974.0s)]
*  Puts in a lot of work down there. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5977.0s)]
*  Shabili from 155 to add our Bellator Shabili. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5979.0s)]
*  This is a thing about Bellator. Unfortunately, people aren't recognizing it. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5983.0s)]
*  They just like they watch it casually, but they don't have the kind of fan base that the UFC has. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5987.0s)]
*  No, no, no, not even close. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5992.0s)]
*  It's unfortunate because guys like Eblen are so fucking talented. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5993.0s)]
*  There's so many people, Michael Venom, Paige, there's so many people over there that are so good. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=5997.0s)]
*  Yeah. They're so good and so fun to watch. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6001.0s)]
*  You know, Douglas Lima. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6004.0s)]
*  Douglas Lima. That motherfucker's leg kicks out of this world. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6006.0s)]
*  Left hook, straight right. Yeah. Always been a big fan of Lima, man. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6010.0s)]
*  And one of the best in the world. I always wanted Lima to compete. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6013.0s)]
*  Like, I don't know where he's at, like in his prime, but like when he was at the top in Bellator, [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6016.0s)]
*  I always wanted him over at the UFC because I was like, I just think that guy. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6021.0s)]
*  Especially against like the better strikers. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6024.0s)]
*  Yes. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6025.0s)]
*  The wrestlers, they kind of had his number there, but against strikers, [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6026.0s)]
*  would have got my money, would have paid for sure. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6029.0s)]
*  He was a motherfucker. He really was a motherfucker. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6031.0s)]
*  And that was when Askren handled him. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6034.0s)]
*  That was when I was like, man, I want to see what happens when Askren gets into the UFC [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6038.0s)]
*  because Askren in that time when he was the Bellator champion, they just let him go. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6042.0s)]
*  They're like, you're too boring, which is crazy. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6046.0s)]
*  As a champion, they're like, we don't want to watch your fight. Get out of here. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6048.0s)]
*  He's a blanket, man. He's a blanket, no excitement. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6051.0s)]
*  And it takes a lot of attrition and conditioning and skill to do that. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6053.0s)]
*  But when guys fight like that, they're doing the complete opposite of fighting. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6059.0s)]
*  They're doing everything in their power for them not to land the blow and me not to land the blow. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6063.0s)]
*  And it's kind of like, bro, you're almost trying too hard to sniff a crotch or sniff an armpit. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6067.0s)]
*  It's fighting, but it's also entertainment. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6072.0s)]
*  He wasn't finishing guys. He's just literally hugging guys to death. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6075.0s)]
*  My perspective was I'm fascinated to see who he can do that to because he did that to a lot of guys. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6078.0s)]
*  Guys that were killers. And he just put that fucking wrestling on. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6086.0s)]
*  And the beautiful thing about the way you knocked him out is you preyed on his instincts. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6092.0s)]
*  You went at an angle and then right to him and his instinct was just automatically to grab you. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6098.0s)]
*  That is one of the most iconic photos in the history of the fucking sport. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6104.0s)]
*  And then you use that even in your papers. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6110.0s)]
*  Let's just show Jorge has papers. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6113.0s)]
*  Trio 5 baby. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6116.0s)]
*  Trio 5 papers and it says at the bottom, super necessary. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6117.0s)]
*  Let's go, man. It's super necessary you get them papers. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6121.0s)]
*  But yeah, knockout. I mean, I remember watching that going, oh my God. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6125.0s)]
*  You know, a lot of it was also psychological, man. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6130.0s)]
*  I knew from hanging out that he wasn't good at adapting. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6135.0s)]
*  It's like, hey, you got to come prove it now. Something like that. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6140.0s)]
*  I was saying like all that shit talking, you got to do it now. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6143.0s)]
*  Go to the side and then boom, right in. Out cold. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6152.0s)]
*  But the whole thing is the walking over him that really gets him to change his speed. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6156.0s)]
*  I saw that on Twitter, you know, I always like to study my dudes in different ways. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6160.0s)]
*  This is the best decision. Your celebration. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6165.0s)]
*  On Twitter I saw that he was very witty and constantly writing shit like that. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6170.0s)]
*  He's a dork and a nerd, but you know, he's got a little bit of wit behind the computer screen. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6175.0s)]
*  When I saw him face to face every time and it was straight, [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6180.0s)]
*  My Q versus yours, improvisation versus your improvisation. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6183.0s)]
*  Maybe you've been thinking about some stupid shit for like a month and you're going to say it to me now. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6186.0s)]
*  But he froze up every single time. And these were like a lot of encounters we had off camera. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6189.0s)]
*  Like I remember I saw him and I was like ducked off in a corner and he was walking by this room. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6194.0s)]
*  I'm like, well, I'm just going to spring up on this dude and scare the living shit out of him. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6199.0s)]
*  So I did pop, pop up on him, hands behind my back, literally short-circuited. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6202.0s)]
*  Hey, hey, hey, hey, Master, I heard you're a very tough guy. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6206.0s)]
*  I got to use the bathroom. I'm following. No, no, no, let's talk. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6209.0s)]
*  I just want to talk. Don't worry. I'm not going to do nothing. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6211.0s)]
*  You come over here. Let me talk to you, bro. Why is it so corny? [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6213.0s)]
*  Motherfucker. And I'm just, you know, trying to provide him. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6215.0s)]
*  And I noticed every single time that it was unscripted, unimprovised like that, just spur of the moment. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6217.0s)]
*  Short circuit. Couldn't fucking, you know, keep it together. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6224.0s)]
*  So I was like, I not only need to run at him, but I need to have like a change of speed because that's going to make him go into his natural crotch sniffing inks. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6228.0s)]
*  Inks, inks. If I just change the speed on him, he's going to fucking duck. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6237.0s)]
*  So that's why I came out slow, cut the little angle and let him like, oh, okay, you know, we're going to circle it up. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6240.0s)]
*  As soon as I change speed, what does he do? Go to his fucking initial inks, thinks he's a fucking crotch sniffer and go sniff the crotch and say you're going to kiss his nigga bye, though. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6245.0s)]
*  That was one of the greatest knockouts in the history of the sport without a doubt. I mean, one of the best ever. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6254.0s)]
*  Thank you, sir. Plus it doesn't take up too much of your time. You know, you got that, you want to see that body real quick, bam, you know, and it's over. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6259.0s)]
*  It was just a giant screen and that was like you fucking launched into him. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6266.0s)]
*  It was hilarious, though, like right away on Twitter. He's like, well, that sucked. And then I counted his ass out, you know. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6272.0s)]
*  Boom. I mean, he leaned into it, too. I mean, he was dying to sniff the crotch. Dying, bro. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6279.0s)]
*  He's like, he should have been invited to the Sam Bankman Freed Party. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6287.0s)]
*  Horrible knockout. One of the worst ever and one of the greatest ever. It's just the way you set it up, though. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6293.0s)]
*  And then watching video footage of you practicing that over and over and over again and knowing that that was a plan. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6299.0s)]
*  So when I'm doing it the night before, I'm like 95 percent certain because of the way he's been acting all week. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6306.0s)]
*  Like all I got to do at any given moment is just get the sky uncomfortable. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6312.0s)]
*  Go from like chill to invade a space where there wasn't an opening bout or like in the second round or midway through the third. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6317.0s)]
*  I just knew I had to invade a space and he's going to go to his natural instincts. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6324.0s)]
*  I know I keep saying it, but I just knew it. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6327.0s)]
*  Like the way he'd freeze up every time we talked, the way he'd walk, the way to get stiff. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6329.0s)]
*  I just knew like. I mean, you literally practice the exact same thing over and over and over again. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6334.0s)]
*  It's so it's so wild to see. Like it's like when Connor knocked out Jose Aldo, you ever see that shit where he was practicing that? [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6338.0s)]
*  He was like mimicking Aldo and then he's practicing like just launching that left hand when he moves in. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6346.0s)]
*  Yeah. And then in the same thing, got him out of character, got him fucked up and flustered, got him angry. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6351.0s)]
*  Nobody had disrespected Aldo before that. Everyone was terrified of Aldo. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6357.0s)]
*  I still think one of the greatest 145ers. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6361.0s)]
*  One of the greatest of all time. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6363.0s)]
*  Ever. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6364.0s)]
*  I mean, yeah, Connor got him. Yeah, Connor got him. No doubt. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6365.0s)]
*  But he was better than Connor overall. His wrestling fucking. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6367.0s)]
*  His career was certainly better than Connor's. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6370.0s)]
*  Way better. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6372.0s)]
*  But the thing about Connor is in that first round, particularly, he's so explosive and so quick timing to. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6373.0s)]
*  Yeah. Comes in with the timing on fucking like dialed right in that touch of death. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6379.0s)]
*  He's got these big ass hands and he just fucking launches them at people in that first round. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6383.0s)]
*  He's one of the most dangerous guys alive. For sure. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6388.0s)]
*  He's so good. And it's just I wonder how he's going to come back with that leg break. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6390.0s)]
*  Here it is. Here's some practicing like he's doing like how Aldo moves and then he's doing how he moves. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6394.0s)]
*  That's it. Like he knew what was going to happen. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6400.0s)]
*  And then here, look at this. This weird style. Throwing that sidekick. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6403.0s)]
*  And then here it comes. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6408.0s)]
*  Bang. I mean, crazy. And he got clipped as well. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6412.0s)]
*  Yeah. In the process. Well, he's got a hell of a fucking chin. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6416.0s)]
*  And Connor has a hell of a chin too, especially at 45. At 45 he would just walk through dudes. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6420.0s)]
*  I heard he would have the massive weight cuts too at 45. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6425.0s)]
*  Oh my God. He looked like death. He was one of those guys when I would see him. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6427.0s)]
*  That was the real weigh-ins. That wasn't the weigh-ins where guys were at ceremonial weigh-in. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6432.0s)]
*  Where they weighed in at 10 o'clock in the morning. Look at him at weigh-in. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6437.0s)]
*  That motherfucker looks like he's on death's door. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6440.0s)]
*  And all that flexing and crazy. Like your body is like you could cramp up real bad at that point in time. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6443.0s)]
*  It's happened to me numerous times. You flex a little too hard after the weight cut. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6449.0s)]
*  Look at the difference. I mean, it's extraordinary. I mean, he's gaining a solid 20 plus pounds of water. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6452.0s)]
*  So just the amount of mental strength it took to get down to that 145, it was crazy. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6458.0s)]
*  But at 145 he's so fucking big. That's the thing. There's a giant benefit to it. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6465.0s)]
*  But man, the cost on your kidneys and your organs. And the chin. And the chin. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6472.0s)]
*  The reflexes. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6477.0s)]
*  Oh, your head. You're just fucking tired. But that was the IV days though too. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6478.0s)]
*  You could rehydrate. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6482.0s)]
*  Four banana bags to the face you'll find the next day. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6483.0s)]
*  Reinflate. You would see guys weigh in. And the only guy who freaked me out was Yoel. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6486.0s)]
*  Yoel Romero would look so big at 185. You're like, how is that 185? How is it even possible? [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6493.0s)]
*  He looks like a heavyweight. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6499.0s)]
*  I've known Yoel since he got to America. I was a fan of him before. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6500.0s)]
*  I remember watching him compete in the Olympics. He's Cuban so my whole family, everybody, we're always cheering for this dude. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6504.0s)]
*  And this dude was like, just fucking Roy Jones Jr. type cloth. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6510.0s)]
*  And he didn't even start in the UFC until he was 36. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6517.0s)]
*  And he doesn't lift weights. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6521.0s)]
*  He doesn't lift weights? [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6522.0s)]
*  Maybe he's lifting weights now. But when we were training constantly together, it was just push ups, pull ups, squat jumps. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6524.0s)]
*  He'd do a lot of body workouts and he looks like he's a fucking pro bodybuilder. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6531.0s)]
*  He's the freakiest of the freaks in terms of athletic freaks. Just extraordinary athletic freaks. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6536.0s)]
*  And dense. Out of everybody that I've trained with, I've never felt someone denser. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6543.0s)]
*  I remember he had just started and so we'd always trade techniques. He'd show me what he would do in wrestling in certain positions. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6548.0s)]
*  And I'm showing him in striking. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6554.0s)]
*  Here's him warming up. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6556.0s)]
*  Crazy flexible. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6558.0s)]
*  Crazy flexible, crazy athletic. But you know, I had him on the podcast and Joey Diaz translated. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6560.0s)]
*  It was amazing. It was amazing. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6566.0s)]
*  But he was talking about the Cuban program. He goes, they turn you into a machine. They turn you into a machine. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6569.0s)]
*  He goes, you, you can eat. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6576.0s)]
*  Those were his workouts back then. Literally. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6579.0s)]
*  He'd do like 50 of those, then take a break and then do another 50 of those and that was his weight lifting. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6582.0s)]
*  It's extraordinary because, you know, the guy, I mean, because he didn't want to gas out, rarely used his wrestling. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6587.0s)]
*  And he's one of the best wrestlers ever. I mean, he was an extraordinary wrestler. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6593.0s)]
*  But his flying knee knockout of Chris Weidman is also one of the greatest of all time. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6597.0s)]
*  His debut UFC, he gets a flying knockout. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6602.0s)]
*  He's with me and my trainer, Paulino Hernandez. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6605.0s)]
*  And I've landed the knee a couple of times in Japan and hurt guys and gotten some good success off it. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6608.0s)]
*  So we had team fights. He's like, hey, man, I want to learn the flying knee. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6614.0s)]
*  You know, so we showed it to him, like, not lying, two weeks and like five days before his fight. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6618.0s)]
*  And we showed him a quick little setup for it. You know, you go forward, you go back, you go forward and you go back. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6623.0s)]
*  And when he goes back, if he comes forward, you jump with him. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6629.0s)]
*  And fucking his first UFC fight does it. He literally, I saw it with my own eyes. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6631.0s)]
*  He learned this technique two fucking weeks before. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6635.0s)]
*  I saw it in you, bro. This not only because those guys that are athletic. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6638.0s)]
*  Yeah, this guy's also fucking. [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6642.0s)]
*  He's also like he would move so slowly and casual and then boom, there it is. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6646.0s)]
*  Show the one with Chris Weidman because Chris Weidman is even more impressive. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6652.0s)]
*  And there he is when he was on the pocket. He was like 220 pounds when he came in to do the podcast. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6657.0s)]
*  His traps look like fucking buildings, bro. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6660.0s)]
*  He's a fucking house. Here's the Weidman fight. It was a good fight. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6663.0s)]
*  It was a great fight. Boom. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6669.0s)]
*  And then fucking the cat likeness, how he landed and everything. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6671.0s)]
*  Oh my God. He was extraordinary. I mean, he's just a freak. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6674.0s)]
*  You know, when they brought him to Australia, I've told the story before. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6677.0s)]
*  Forgive me if you've heard this, folks. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6681.0s)]
*  They brought him to Australia and he had a fractured orbital and they brought him to the doctor. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6683.0s)]
*  So he gets examined and the doctor calls the UFC goes, where did you get this guy? [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6687.0s)]
*  And they go, what do you mean? And they go, he's a fucking specimen. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6692.0s)]
*  And he goes, oh, yeah, he's amazing. Right. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6695.0s)]
*  They go, no, no, no, you don't understand. He goes, I've been a doctor for 50 years. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6697.0s)]
*  I've never seen someone like him. He said his the tendons in his eyes are three times larger than a normal person's. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6702.0s)]
*  He said the orbital fracture, it's already healing. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6709.0s)]
*  Like he's just a athletic freak. The most rarest of the rare. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6712.0s)]
*  I used to kick this guy in the fucking leg or the fucking form. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6717.0s)]
*  And everybody that he's fought always says that, you know, you saw his performance with Izzy. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6721.0s)]
*  I think Izzy in the first round, Izzy kept touching it because he truly is the most dense guy I've ever worked out with. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6725.0s)]
*  That's what Luke Rockhold said. He was like he was made out of metal. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6732.0s)]
*  Bro, it's not a fucking lie, bro. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6734.0s)]
*  And it's crazy because he did lift weights, push-ups, pull-ups, those jumping shit. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6736.0s)]
*  But he would be very disciplined with it, you know, like no matter what he did, boom, every day he had like his little set of doing things to keep himself in shape. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6740.0s)]
*  And remember, he got like you said, he got into UFC at what, 36, 37? [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6747.0s)]
*  36! [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6750.0s)]
*  If he comes over from Cuba after winning the first world championship, was that 19 years old? [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6751.0s)]
*  Was that the first one that he won? [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6755.0s)]
*  Oh! [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6756.0s)]
*  Then he sold matches and did what he had to do to get money. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6757.0s)]
*  If he comes in at like 19 over here, he's like numerous time champion and at different weights. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6760.0s)]
*  100%. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6765.0s)]
*  And the ability to learn from that guy too was unparalleled, bro. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6766.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's like there's levels to athleticism and he's... [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6769.0s)]
*  And he's a mean guy too. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6773.0s)]
*  Oh yeah, nice guy too. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6775.0s)]
*  No, super nice guy. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6777.0s)]
*  But when anything related with competition, you're talking about a pissing contest or a spitting contest, he's trying to fucking outdo you. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6778.0s)]
*  Oh, well think about where he came up from. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6784.0s)]
*  I mean, what made him is that Cuban program. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6786.0s)]
*  They turn you into a machine. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6789.0s)]
*  And that's all you got over there. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6791.0s)]
*  It's either that or be like everybody else, broke and misery, you know? [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6793.0s)]
*  Yep, yeah. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6796.0s)]
*  I mean, that's how they make people the way they are. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6797.0s)]
*  I mean, it's pretty extraordinary, but man, that dude, I would have loved to see him when he was younger. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6800.0s)]
*  I mean, it's really kind of incredible that you get him essentially at your age just making his debut. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6806.0s)]
*  Wild. Wild. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6812.0s)]
*  You can see from fight to fight just how much he's evolving. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6814.0s)]
*  You know, he's like, ah, this wrestling stuff is cool, but I need to knock people the fuck out of it. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6817.0s)]
*  And he still looks fucking great. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6822.0s)]
*  He's fighting in Bellator now, right? [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6823.0s)]
*  He still looks fucking great. [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6825.0s)]
*  At 205. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6827.0s)]
*  It's incredible. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6828.0s)]
*  I mean, it's I mean, what an extraordinary human being. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6829.0s)]
*  Just so unusual. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6832.0s)]
*  And the fucking the style that he had just like so loose and relaxed. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6834.0s)]
*  Boom! [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6839.0s)]
*  And then out of nowhere. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6840.0s)]
*  And he's wrestling too defensively. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6841.0s)]
*  Offensive is just beautiful. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6843.0s)]
*  Like in that same Chris Weidman fight, you can see his intelligence. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6845.0s)]
*  It's before that knee. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6848.0s)]
*  He goes for a takedown. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6849.0s)]
*  Weidman stuffs it. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6850.0s)]
*  And the way that Weidman stuffs it, he knows if he does it again, I'm going to fucking take him right down. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6851.0s)]
*  And he shoots the same takedown. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6857.0s)]
*  Weidman stuffs it the same way. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6858.0s)]
*  And boom! [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6860.0s)]
*  Right on his fucking back. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6861.0s)]
*  Just like a fucking thing of beauty, man. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6862.0s)]
*  Levels. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6864.0s)]
*  It's that Olympic level wrestling. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6865.0s)]
*  That's why it's so fascinating to see like guys like Bo Nichol and these like elite, elite wrestlers coming in at an early age. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6866.0s)]
*  That's another fucking problem. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6874.0s)]
*  Real problem. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6875.0s)]
*  Huge fan of that guy. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6876.0s)]
*  I've been watching him since his freshman year, but I hate when this motherfucker goes with me on the mat. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6877.0s)]
*  He is a fucking nightmare, bro. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6881.0s)]
*  I can imagine. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6883.0s)]
*  He's so good already on the ground. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6884.0s)]
*  Because that's a very studious guy, too. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6885.0s)]
*  He obviously the wrestling is fucking second nature. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6887.0s)]
*  I was talking to his mom once. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6890.0s)]
*  He had like 85 wrestling matches before the age of nine. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6891.0s)]
*  So, you know, like you're just it's part of his psyche, his subconscious. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6895.0s)]
*  But how fast he's getting on the ground, it's scary. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6900.0s)]
*  I'm seeing it in myself from like a year and a half ago when he came into right now, the way he's getting legit black belts and just like fucking takedown, half guard, side mount submission. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6903.0s)]
*  What the fuck, bro? [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6914.0s)]
*  Taking guys backs, putting the fucking triangle on him, choke him out. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6916.0s)]
*  He's the guy that fucking could go very far. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6919.0s)]
*  Very far. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6923.0s)]
*  Very far. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6924.0s)]
*  And the hype on him is so intense. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6925.0s)]
*  Like a guy fights on the pay-per-view is first fight in the UFC. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6926.0s)]
*  He doesn't even have fucking 15 minutes of K-time. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6930.0s)]
*  He has like a total combined. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6933.0s)]
*  I think I'm not exaggerating. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6934.0s)]
*  I don't think he makes around me. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6936.0s)]
*  I don't think he has five total minutes of combat. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6937.0s)]
*  It's extraordinary. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6940.0s)]
*  It's elite level wrestling, in my opinion, is the best base. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6941.0s)]
*  The best base, for sure. [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6945.0s)]
*  Because you could dictate where the fight goes, you know, if you stay up on your feet or if you take it down, you know, and it's just like I was always fascinated by striking. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6946.0s)]
*  So I grew up with the striking. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6954.0s)]
*  But once I realized, like, it doesn't matter how good fast or hard a punch, if I can't keep it on my feet, this means nothing. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6956.0s)]
*  I can't knock you out from from being on guard or being mounted, you know. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6962.0s)]
*  So I really like focus the last like, I don't know, 14 years of my career heavy grappling and mainly defensive, you know, when I tell you that like 70 percent of my mat time is just spent on like wrestling, whether it be offense or defense. [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6966.0s)]
*  And then the other stuff is striking because it just comes so naturally to me, even even like the endurance, you know, I could not spar for numerous weeks. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6980.0s)]
*  I'll jump into American top team with the best guys that we have there. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6988.0s)]
*  And if it's just straight striking, I can't get tired. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6991.0s)]
*  I could do five rounds and it's just chilling. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6994.0s)]
*  I've got to wrestle five hard minutes with another fucking all American or national champion. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=6996.0s)]
*  Different story, man. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7000.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's nothing like it. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7001.0s)]
*  What weighs on you in wrestling is the kind of endurance that's required in wrestling is just so different. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7003.0s)]
*  And that's where a guy like Yoel or a guy like Bo Nickel that spent their life doing that. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7009.0s)]
*  They're so efficient. [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7013.0s)]
*  It's just a completely different kind of ability to push and to drain people in those exchanges. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7014.0s)]
*  Just being efficient where maybe you're going to take down on me, but I'm going to get away in seconds. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7021.0s)]
*  But if I take you down, I'm going to fucking worry the fuck out. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7026.0s)]
*  I'm going to put all your hands, all your weight on your hands. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7029.0s)]
*  I'm going to make you carry my fucking weight. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7031.0s)]
*  By the time we get out of here, you've been carrying me for like three minutes and a half. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7033.0s)]
*  It changes you. Now your snap, your electricity, everything slows down just a bit, man. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7037.0s)]
*  Are those the most frustrating losses for you, like the first fight with Kamaru or the Kobe Covington fight, these wrestling heavy fights? [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7042.0s)]
*  Definitely. And it's something that 170 has always been dominant. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7049.0s)]
*  I feel in other divisions, maybe I could have had an easier path to the title because it was striking oriented, things like that. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7054.0s)]
*  At 170, it's always been since the Matt Hughes range, GSP has always been grappler, wrestler dense. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7061.0s)]
*  It's not frustrating. It's like fucking fuck, bro. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7068.0s)]
*  Like, damn, I want to fight and I prepared so hard for this like little position. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7073.0s)]
*  Like he gets into a single leg and if he pops his head this way, I'm going to do this. [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7077.0s)]
*  And if he goes that way, I'm going to do it. I have all these game plans. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7080.0s)]
*  Then you get there and the guy's just better than you in that situation before you know you're on your back. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7082.0s)]
*  Minutes gone by, now you're fucking down. You finally get back up. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7086.0s)]
*  The guy's not engaging, he's moving like you're trying to throw strikes. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7089.0s)]
*  So definitely frustration, you know, but like everything, man, you got to just get better where you suck. [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7092.0s)]
*  For the longest time, I've always known I'm gifted with the hands, the speed, the power. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7097.0s)]
*  Why I need to always put in my time and effort and I've always done that is wrestling and wrestling defensive. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7101.0s)]
*  Well, you've always been good at wrestling defensively, but what's been always extraordinary about you is like the sneaky shit. [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7107.0s)]
*  The way you set up stuff, like the Darren Till knockout, the way he stepped in and threw that hook. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7115.0s)]
*  That was a big win too because that was at the time when Darren Till had so much hype on him. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7122.0s)]
*  He was like number three at the time. I had like a year layoff, came back, went to his own town and did it. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7128.0s)]
*  Just like I'm about to do to Leon's bitch ass. I'm going to go to England and knock his fucking head off his shoulders. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7134.0s)]
*  Because that's a good style matchup for me. He's not a wrestler. He can't wrestle for five rounds. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7138.0s)]
*  And he's not better technically than me. He's going to have to stand there with me and fucking throw blows. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7143.0s)]
*  And that's why I'm going to fucking hurt that dude, bro. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7148.0s)]
*  You can't look past Gilbert though, right? [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7150.0s)]
*  Never look past any man. But I started training not for Gilbert, but I started training period. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7152.0s)]
*  I'm going to say like four months ago. So I'm one of the best shapes of my life. I haven't got no injuries. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7158.0s)]
*  And my mind is right, man. For a long time, I didn't want to fight. I had a lot of things outside of the ring that weren't going right. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7164.0s)]
*  So I wasn't trying to compete while all these other fucked up things were happening. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7170.0s)]
*  I got three felonies on one side of the thing. I got some lawsuits, got injuries, got losses. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7174.0s)]
*  I was like, you know what? There's a lot of bad juju I got to get out of my life. So I did, you know, in all types of shapes and aspects. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7180.0s)]
*  I've cut out a lot of negativity and things that maybe weren't negative, but were leading to negativity like gateways to negativity. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7186.0s)]
*  Things that I didn't need in my life. So I just fucking I feel that for the 20 years I've been in this fucking sport. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7192.0s)]
*  I'm in probably one of the best places right now mentally. And eight months ago, I mean, you can see pictures online. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7200.0s)]
*  I was like 220 pounds. I was in a fucking dark place for a fucking long, long time. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7206.0s)]
*  I've been living my life very different. Never to hit that rock bottom. No matter what happens ever again in my life. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7211.0s)]
*  It's just I'll never hit that again, bro. It was like the worst of the worst, you know. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7216.0s)]
*  It was just because that was the first time that it happened to you? [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7221.0s)]
*  Because of the knockout and like numerous things in my life and the way that it was too, you know, because I'm leading up to the first Usman fight. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7224.0s)]
*  Me and the UFC can't come to terms and agreement, right. And I'm in great shape. [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7232.0s)]
*  So the fight six weeks out gets cut out like, no, we're not going to make it happen. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7236.0s)]
*  You know, I want more money on my pay per view, not on my guarantee. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7240.0s)]
*  But I'm like, man, if I'm going to sell XYZ pay per views, fuck, bro, I want to get paid, you know. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7243.0s)]
*  And then the fight gets cut off. And then six days later, they bring it to my face and I'm not in shape. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7249.0s)]
*  Fucking 20 pounds heavier. So I fucking I go out there and I give it my best and I come up short. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7254.0s)]
*  And like that like sinks into me like, fuck, bro, did I do the right thing? [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7259.0s)]
*  Maybe I should have taken a fucking slightly less pay cut and gone after the thing that I've always wanted the most, the fucking belt. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7263.0s)]
*  But I also wanted to get my value. And in that also got like a great deal with the UFC taking the fight in six days. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7270.0s)]
*  I was able to secure some great things for me and my family. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7276.0s)]
*  So it wasn't like a total loss, but it was already like, fuck, bro, did I do the wrong thing? [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7279.0s)]
*  And then for the second fight, me and Usman were supposed to coach Ultimate Fighter. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7283.0s)]
*  And it was supposed to be like somewhere in September, October. [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7288.0s)]
*  They were supposed to fight. So the UFC is telling me, yeah, we're going to fight in September, October. [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7293.0s)]
*  So I tell them, hey, I'm going to go do stem cells down in Colombia. Here's all the paperwork. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7297.0s)]
*  Is this good for you guys? Can I go do this? [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7301.0s)]
*  Since I'm going to do this in September, there's not going to be no problems. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7303.0s)]
*  They're like, yeah, they're running through. You saw it or they check it with other guys. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7305.0s)]
*  You're good because you're going to be coaching in September fighting by October, November. [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7309.0s)]
*  Well, while I'm in Colombia, I get the call and say, hey, we're going to have the first live event, sporting event. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7312.0s)]
*  It's going to happen in Florida. We want you to fucking be a part of it. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7317.0s)]
*  And I fucking, I jumped on it. I was like, man, last time I fought them on six day notice, I did all right. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7321.0s)]
*  Now I'm getting like five weeks notice. It's not in September, October, how they told me, but fuck it. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7325.0s)]
*  I'm going to jump on it again. And they didn't work out for me, man. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7330.0s)]
*  You know, so that sent me like until fucking like, bro, I shouldn't have took the fight. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7334.0s)]
*  I told myself at the first fight, I won't fight this guy again without 10 weeks to prepare for him because that's what I need to prepare for this guy. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7337.0s)]
*  So I just went into like a fucking dark place and for a while and and when sometimes you need dark places, addiction happens and fucking bad shit. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7343.0s)]
*  And now just more bad shit, breathe bad shit. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7351.0s)]
*  And I'm hanging around the circle and maybe I shouldn't be and it's just getting like worse. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7354.0s)]
*  And I always thank God, man, because fuck, I saw the light and I was like, this is not me. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7357.0s)]
*  I come from like a much worse environment where there was drug addicts around me, where life wasn't promised to me. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7363.0s)]
*  A fucking a sixty thousand dollar job was out of the question. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7369.0s)]
*  Now I'm here, I've gained so much and I'm going to fucking let this shit beat me up. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7371.0s)]
*  So I went David Goggins on it, I went Jordan Peterson on it. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7376.0s)]
*  I'm just like, I'm being a fucking bitch dog. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7379.0s)]
*  And this is not overnight. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7382.0s)]
*  This is like way before the Gilbert fight. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7384.0s)]
*  I've been just fucking training and training and putting in the time, especially in the areas where I'm not so great. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7386.0s)]
*  And now I feel like it's all been paying off, you know, and I'm not looking past Gilbert, but I am going to make him a stepping stone example. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7390.0s)]
*  And I'm going to say now because it's what's going to happen and it's going to be a movie ending. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7398.0s)]
*  I'm going to go fight Leon after that and I'm going to fucking rip his head off, you know, not in person. [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7401.0s)]
*  I know he can't stand me, but I give a fuck less about him. [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7405.0s)]
*  I just want that belt, you know, there is Colby and Dana has said that Colby is going to fight for the title. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7408.0s)]
*  Who knows? You know, Dana says a lot of things. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7414.0s)]
*  He does say a lot of things. I love Dana. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7417.0s)]
*  But, you know, now he's defending the belt against one of the best pound for pound guys. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7419.0s)]
*  Leon, I heard is coming to Miami. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7423.0s)]
*  I just got to do my job. He's coming to Miami this week. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7425.0s)]
*  Two weeks. Yeah, I heard that he's going to be there. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7427.0s)]
*  You know, didn't he say that he was going to Miami? I don't know. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7429.0s)]
*  I would imagine he would want to be there. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7432.0s)]
*  Yeah, I heard in one of the interviews that he was coming to Miami. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7433.0s)]
*  So I'm going to make sure I do my job and perform and fight and forget about all the other stuff. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7435.0s)]
*  I'm just going to go out there and take care of Gilbert and then let the chips fall where they may, you know. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7440.0s)]
*  What happened with you and Colby? [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7444.0s)]
*  He's a bitch, bro. He showed his true colors for the money, for the pay-per-view. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7446.0s)]
*  He'd talk about my kids, my family, to maybe sell extra pay-per-views. [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7451.0s)]
*  And you were friends with him? [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7455.0s)]
*  No, not friends. I was fucking everything. He's a mentor. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7456.0s)]
*  I was already in the strike force. I had competed against Gilbert Melendez. [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7458.0s)]
*  I was an established pro when he came over to American Top Team. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7461.0s)]
*  I was living up at American Top Team. I had an apartment over there for like about a year and change. [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7464.0s)]
*  He broke his hand. His girlfriend had fucking kicked him out of the place because he had given her fucking herpes and shit. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7470.0s)]
*  No, I'm dead-ass serious. So he had like nowhere to fucking live. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7476.0s)]
*  So he asked if he could crash on my couch. I was like, yeah, fuck it, bro. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7479.0s)]
*  We're both on this journey together. We train together, play poker together. [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7481.0s)]
*  Fucking this and that. So I basically fed this dude for a fucking year. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7484.0s)]
*  Lived on my couch. Didn't give me a fucking dollar because he didn't have a job. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7488.0s)]
*  I had a fucking broken hand. It's all documented. It's all him on YouTube saying, [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7491.0s)]
*  Jorge Mazur, that was my best friend. If it wasn't for Jorge, I wouldn't be here. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7494.0s)]
*  And this and that. And then, you know, I'm at 155. [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7497.0s)]
*  So then I come up to 170 and I start stealing a lot of, not stealing, but I start getting a lot of shine from myself. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7500.0s)]
*  A lot of eyeballs start looking at me and immediately instead of like, yeah, we're fucking boys. [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7505.0s)]
*  We could fight or whatever the fuck. He turns into something fucking ugly. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7510.0s)]
*  You know, like everything that I did for you, you're trying to use it against me, especially my kids. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7515.0s)]
*  He knows the relationship I have with my kids and you're trying to use that against me. [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7518.0s)]
*  You're a fucking piece of shit. But before all that happened, I already knew he wasn't a good person because my striking coach, [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7521.0s)]
*  this is when we cut ties, me and him. My striking coach trained him from his amateur all the way to his Rafael Dos Anjos fight. [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7528.0s)]
*  And he did a handshake deal with them. Five percent on your fights. [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7534.0s)]
*  You know, if you make a thousand dollars, you make five hundred thousand dollars. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7537.0s)]
*  Five percent is where you're going to pay me because that's what Joro Romero pays me. [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7540.0s)]
*  That's what Joran Maciel pays me. That's what all the guys that train with him pay him. [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7543.0s)]
*  You know, and he's like accessible at all times. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7546.0s)]
*  He will drive an hour this way, drive an hour back that way and just give you all his knowledge. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7549.0s)]
*  And that's what he wanted, you know, and they shook hands on it. [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7553.0s)]
*  Soon as Kobe made money, what did he do? Didn't pay my coach. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7557.0s)]
*  So since then, I was like, bro, I want to fucking take a bite to his fucking neck of my coaches. [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7561.0s)]
*  I don't do it, bro. You'll fight him. And that's how you'll get him for both of us. [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7565.0s)]
*  I didn't get him that time, but I promise you, before my career is over, I'm going to fucking murder Kobe in the cage legally. [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7570.0s)]
*  Legally. Legally. [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7577.0s)]
*  What happened illegally? [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7579.0s)]
*  Allegedly, a lot of things happen. Allegedly. [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7581.0s)]
*  I don't know. They're saying a lot of things, but it's all allegedly because I shit, man. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7583.0s)]
*  Allegedly is a great word. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7589.0s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know what they're talking about, man. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7591.0s)]
*  But legally in the cage in the UFC, I'm going to fucking snatch his soul one way or another. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7593.0s)]
*  And that's also something that, you know, losing a piece of shit like that. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7597.0s)]
*  You know, like if you let somebody come into you and you share something with me, like, man, something is very dear to me. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7601.0s)]
*  It's this moment where my mom blah, blah, blah, and this and that. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7607.0s)]
*  And then I would use that because me and you had a falling out. It really shows your fucking character. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7611.0s)]
*  Like you're a fucking piece of shit, you know, and that's why nobody fucks with this guy. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7615.0s)]
*  Nobody fucks with this guy in any level in any accord, you know. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7619.0s)]
*  Well, it's a crazy story. [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7623.0s)]
*  John Jones can't stand him. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7624.0s)]
*  He changed. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7625.0s)]
*  He had a very similar thing with John Jones. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7626.0s)]
*  Yeah, he changed who he was when the UFC was about to cut him. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7627.0s)]
*  And he decided to become like a wrestling heel. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7631.0s)]
*  Shit on the whole country just for what? [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7633.0s)]
*  It worked though. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7636.0s)]
*  I mean, the thing about it is it's kind of genius in the fact that it really did get people paying attention to him. [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7638.0s)]
*  In a negative way, but you know, I feel that he could have just been beating people, put more time into the craft rather than Twitter and trying to copy other heels. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7644.0s)]
*  And it would have been fine. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7652.0s)]
*  This guy just, oh, what is Connor doing today? [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7653.0s)]
*  Let me go do that on the cheaper, shittier way, you know. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7655.0s)]
*  Like be fucking you, bro. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7659.0s)]
*  You know, just fucking go out there and beat dudes up and say what you got to say and it'll come to you. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7660.0s)]
*  It took me a while to get here, you know. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7664.0s)]
*  I had to fucking knock out and beat numerous fucking people, actual champions to get here. [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7666.0s)]
*  But it'll come. [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7670.0s)]
*  You don't have to sell out for the fucking dollar, bro. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7671.0s)]
*  What was it like fighting him? [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7673.0s)]
*  I wanted to fucking kill him. [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7675.0s)]
*  I wanted to hurt him. [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7677.0s)]
*  But it wasn't the best version of me, bro. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7678.0s)]
*  It just wasn't the best version of me. [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7681.0s)]
*  And you know, in this sport, that's what I love about it. [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7683.0s)]
*  It's like what happened, happened and everything else is bullshit, right? [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7686.0s)]
*  So until we fight again, nobody will get to see that better version of me. [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7688.0s)]
*  But I promise you, Joe, before I close this chapter in my life in MMA, I will have competed against this guy. [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7691.0s)]
*  I'm going to fucking take his soul, bro. [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7697.0s)]
*  I just know it after being those five rounds in there with him and that was the best that he had. [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7699.0s)]
*  And that was nowhere near my best at that time for different reasons. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7703.0s)]
*  I know I could fucking end this guy. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7707.0s)]
*  What if the UFC comes to you and says you versus Colby winner for the title? [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7709.0s)]
*  Do you think that's a possible scenario? [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7714.0s)]
*  That's definitely a possible scenario. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7715.0s)]
*  Especially if this... [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7717.0s)]
*  And I would love that because I'd stop him from his dream of fighting for that title. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7718.0s)]
*  If you could somehow or another shock the world in a way with this Gilbert fight, where it's just undeniable, [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7722.0s)]
*  where people just get so fired up about it, and then he starts jabbing because he thinks that somehow or another [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7731.0s)]
*  you're going to take that title shot from him. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7738.0s)]
*  That would be the scenario that I could see you guys face each other. [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7740.0s)]
*  Then I would take the title shot from him. [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7742.0s)]
*  And I'd go fight Leon. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7744.0s)]
*  And since the start of it, I said this from a technical aspect, I fight nothing but wrestler after wrestler after wrestler after wrestler. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7746.0s)]
*  So it's like I said it numerous times in interviews, I want to fight guys that are a little bit more favorable for my style while I work on my wrestling. [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7753.0s)]
*  It's not that I'm putting wrestling to the back burner, but while I'm learning techniques, [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7760.0s)]
*  I'm flying in different coaches across the country just to come wrestle with me, work from the basics, work from zero all the way up. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7763.0s)]
*  And that's what I've been doing the last six months, just like bringing in phenomenal. [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7770.0s)]
*  Bone Nickel's dad, Jason Nickel, came out like six weeks just helping me out. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7774.0s)]
*  And this is a guy that Bone Nickel gives a ton of credit to. [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7778.0s)]
*  He's like, man, my dad literally showed me 80% of my game, bro. [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7781.0s)]
*  I get with him and see what he could do. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7784.0s)]
*  And it just so happens that he was in Florida. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7785.0s)]
*  He was coming out of Florida. [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7787.0s)]
*  So I got to work with him a fucking ton, you know? [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7788.0s)]
*  And I just got to learn like stuff like from a basic level because I skipped high school wrestling, you know, and then go to college wrestling. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7790.0s)]
*  There's a lot of little chinks and mistakes. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7797.0s)]
*  My mind is not weak. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7799.0s)]
*  I might get beat, but it's not because my will was in question. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7800.0s)]
*  Nothing is because you're better in that position. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7803.0s)]
*  You're more efficient in that position. [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7805.0s)]
*  Let me fix him up, especially in wrestling. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7807.0s)]
*  You know, if you've got the heart and determination, the grit to just keep coming after, I could fix these mistakes. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7809.0s)]
*  That's all I've been doing these like last six to eight months. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7814.0s)]
*  And when I get in there with Gil, he's going to fucking feel it right away, bro. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7817.0s)]
*  Like you're not getting a takedown on me no matter what happens, brother. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7821.0s)]
*  The thing about the Kobe fight was Kobe is a very good wrestler. [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7824.0s)]
*  And he has a good gas tank and he's a fucking leech. [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7828.0s)]
*  You know, that collegiate style. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7831.0s)]
*  One thing that they can, you know, you can see from any of those guys is they could fucking dig down deep and get like a takedown when they're tired. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7832.0s)]
*  They're good at putting themselves at bad spots and scoring. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7839.0s)]
*  And also, not to like fucking make excuses, but I also do think that the rules are favored heavily towards like a grappler wrestling type. [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7842.0s)]
*  Because if you're on your knees sniffing crotches, I should be able to fucking knee you in the face. [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7850.0s)]
*  Yes. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7853.0s)]
*  Like what is this bullshit that I can't live for guys like this. [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7854.0s)]
*  Right. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7857.0s)]
*  And he has 350 matches and he's used to scoring here and I can't punch in the back of the head. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7858.0s)]
*  I can't even punch in the bottom because your face is down. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7864.0s)]
*  The only thing logically I could do is knee you with the other knee you're not grabbing. [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7867.0s)]
*  But they don't let us do that. [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7870.0s)]
*  So a lot of the rules I think favor grappling in like certain departments. [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7871.0s)]
*  It's not to make excuses. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7875.0s)]
*  It's the truth because a fight is a fight. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7876.0s)]
*  If you're grabbing, if you're trying to suck in my leg, why can't I fucking use it as a knee? [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7878.0s)]
*  100%. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7882.0s)]
*  I'll give it to you and fucking knee you in the jaw. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7883.0s)]
*  You're going to fucking turtle up real quick. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7884.0s)]
*  You're going to shut up or they're going to drop guard. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7886.0s)]
*  I agree with that 100%. [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7888.0s)]
*  You know, there's a lot of things that it kind of leans towards wrestling. [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7889.0s)]
*  The downed opponent thing where you can touch one hand down. [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7893.0s)]
*  I know they've changed that in some places. [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7896.0s)]
*  But there's other places that still consider one hand down. [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7898.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7901.0s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense and it does favor the grappler. [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7902.0s)]
*  It's also unrealistic. [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7904.0s)]
*  Unrealistic. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7905.0s)]
*  Like if a guy is on the ground, I think you should be able to knee him in the head. [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7906.0s)]
*  I mean, you see it in 1FC. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7910.0s)]
*  You see it in a lot of other places. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7911.0s)]
*  That's a legitimate position. [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7913.0s)]
*  And don't be in that position then because it's the way the fight's going to get stopped. [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7914.0s)]
*  How many times you see like a guy that's been wrestling could be in that position, dead tired out of his mind, [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7918.0s)]
*  shoots a horrible shot, gets on his knees and stays there for like 20 seconds. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7923.0s)]
*  And all you can do is punch his body. [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7926.0s)]
*  And then gets back up and finishes. [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7928.0s)]
*  He's more skilled. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7930.0s)]
*  He's more efficient there, yes. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7931.0s)]
*  But it's not realistic. [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7932.0s)]
*  Like you said, in a real fight, you'd get your fucking eye orbital crushed in, you know. [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7933.0s)]
*  100%. [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7937.0s)]
*  And you would never stay in that position. [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7938.0s)]
*  You wouldn't. [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7940.0s)]
*  You would know there's danger in that position. [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7941.0s)]
*  You wouldn't. [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7942.0s)]
*  Just like every other position. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7943.0s)]
*  It's like, that's a, I mean, if we're looking at it as the art of fighting, and this is what the sport is. [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7944.0s)]
*  The sport is as close to real fighting as you can get. [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7949.0s)]
*  There's no way you should be able to do that. [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7952.0s)]
*  There's no way you should be able to be on your knees, working for a takedown, and not get knee in the face. [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7954.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7958.0s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7959.0s)]
*  100%. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7960.0s)]
*  Why, you're vulnerable. [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7961.0s)]
*  That's like, don't do that because of the vulnerability. [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7962.0s)]
*  But there's other positions where you don't do something because of the vulnerability and you get hit. [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7965.0s)]
*  Like in that one, we shield the wrestler from that potential situation of getting knee in the face. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7970.0s)]
*  And it would just. [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7976.0s)]
*  Doesn't make sense either. [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7978.0s)]
*  It would just change a lot of outcomes of fights if that. [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7979.0s)]
*  It would. [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7981.0s)]
*  If that gets instituted, like overnight, we'd see a swinging, like wrestling, holding like dominance in MMA a lot. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7982.0s)]
*  It would even out the playing field a lot, and overnight. [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7988.0s)]
*  I don't even know if we should stop hitting people in the back of the head. [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7991.0s)]
*  That doesn't make any sense to me because there's a lot of knockouts, like high kicks. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7995.0s)]
*  They wrap around the back of the shoulder and they go right to the back of your head, and it's legal. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=7998.0s)]
*  And the guy gets KO'd. [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8002.0s)]
*  And there's a lot of times where a guy's fucking not, half-fine knocked out. [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8003.0s)]
*  And you know, perfect example, Dustin Poirier versus Conor. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8007.0s)]
*  He hit him like three times in the back of the head solid, then he goes limp. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8010.0s)]
*  It's like, what the fuck? [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8013.0s)]
*  Just is that the referee's discretion now? [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8014.0s)]
*  Who could hit in the back of the head and who can't? [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8016.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8018.0s)]
*  And in wild exchanges and scrambles, shot like Cyril Gahn and Junior Dos Santos. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8019.0s)]
*  He kind of hit him with an elbow in the back of the head. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8025.0s)]
*  It's like, it should be legal. [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8027.0s)]
*  I don't understand why it's not legal. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8028.0s)]
*  And people say you're more vulnerable there. [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8030.0s)]
*  Well, don't fucking get hit there. [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8032.0s)]
*  You know, Eddie Bravo's talked about this all the time. [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8034.0s)]
*  The old days of MMA, when a guy got someone's back, they would just drop elbows down on his head. [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8036.0s)]
*  Back of the head. [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8042.0s)]
*  If you have your back and the head is there, all this punching just to the side is not realistic. [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8043.0s)]
*  The back of the head with elbows. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8049.0s)]
*  Just one of them. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8051.0s)]
*  And they say it's more dangerous, but... [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8052.0s)]
*  It also opens you up to get away as well. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8054.0s)]
*  It causes more action. [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8056.0s)]
*  So now if you're cocking back and you hit me once in the back of the head and you cock back again, [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8057.0s)]
*  I might do like a somersault to get away from you. [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8061.0s)]
*  I might go for a leg. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8063.0s)]
*  I might do something to get away there and you're giving me the space. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8064.0s)]
*  It would only bring more action. [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8067.0s)]
*  Yeah, it would bring more action and also more realistic. [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8069.0s)]
*  Because you realize you can't just lie flat on your back. [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8072.0s)]
*  You're fucked. [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8075.0s)]
*  Like, you better protect the back of your neck because it's very, very vulnerable. [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8076.0s)]
*  So guys would have to, when they lie on the back or lie on their stomach, [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8079.0s)]
*  they have to protect their fucking head and then they would have to try to roll. [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8084.0s)]
*  They would have to do something to get out of that position. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8087.0s)]
*  Instead of just realizing that you can kind of hold there and cover the sides of your faces [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8090.0s)]
*  because you could leave the back of your head exposed. [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8094.0s)]
*  I mean, I'm sure if you talk to a neuroscientist, they say that's a particularly vulnerable area, [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8096.0s)]
*  but fuck, man, isn't the temple, aren't the eyes? [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8101.0s)]
*  Everything is so vulnerable and all those are legal. [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8104.0s)]
*  You could elbow a dude in the fucking eye socket, 100% legal. [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8106.0s)]
*  So explain to me why the back of the head is so much more vulnerable. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8111.0s)]
*  I don't get it. [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8115.0s)]
*  In theory, somebody could fucking knee you in the ribs, breaks your rib, and your rib punctures your lung. [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8116.0s)]
*  Yes, of course. [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8121.0s)]
*  There's so many vulnerabilities. [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8122.0s)]
*  There's so many things that are legal, like the sidekick to the knee. [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8124.0s)]
*  I mean, the sidekick to the knee is a crazy move. [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8127.0s)]
*  It's like you have the potential to ruin. [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8129.0s)]
*  And that was always a great area. [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8132.0s)]
*  Like, it's illegal and then some guys, they get away with it and then other guys, they wouldn't. [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8134.0s)]
*  And now everybody could do it. [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8138.0s)]
*  But for a long time, sidekicking the knee was fucking illegal. [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8139.0s)]
*  How long was it illegal for? [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8143.0s)]
*  When did it become legal? [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8145.0s)]
*  Man, I remember this much. [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8146.0s)]
*  When I was fighting Gilbert Melendez, I was doing something like that, like some tie teeps to the leg. [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8149.0s)]
*  And the referee called my attention on the second one. [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8155.0s)]
*  Really? [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8157.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8158.0s)]
*  Gilbert said something like, referee called my attention immediately. [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8159.0s)]
*  So it was a very great area. [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8161.0s)]
*  So this is strike force? [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8163.0s)]
*  This is strike force. [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8164.0s)]
*  Interesting. [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8165.0s)]
*  Yeah, and I was like, okay, that's fucking weird. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8166.0s)]
*  Yeah, it is fucking weird because I talked to Eddie Bravo about that. [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8168.0s)]
*  And he's like, well, why, you know, if that's illegal, then why is a heel hook legal? [[02:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8173.0s)]
*  Because you get a guy like Pol Jarez, like Husamara Pol Jarez, who would just rip your fucking shit apart and not let go. [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8179.0s)]
*  Dog on the bone, yeah. [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8186.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8187.0s)]
*  So here's Khalil Roundtree. [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8188.0s)]
*  That was the worst one I ever saw. [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8189.0s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8191.0s)]
*  That was against Bukakis. [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8192.0s)]
*  And he just side kicked his knee into oblivion. [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8194.0s)]
*  It was horrible. [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8197.0s)]
*  And Khalil can fucking kick. [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8198.0s)]
*  Woo. [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8201.0s)]
*  Khalil Roundtree versus Eric Anders is like one of my all time favorite performances. [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8202.0s)]
*  Yeah, he came out straight tie. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8207.0s)]
*  Oh, straight tie. [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8209.0s)]
*  I mean, me and DC were going crazy. [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8210.0s)]
*  Like, look at him. [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8212.0s)]
*  Because he had lost to Johnny Walker and then said, you know what, I got to learn elbows and the clinch. [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8213.0s)]
*  I got to learn tie fighting and went to Thailand and just fell in love with Muay Thai. [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8219.0s)]
*  And came back with teeps and low kicks and middle kicks and high kicks. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8223.0s)]
*  Pick that up rather quick. [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8227.0s)]
*  Khalil Roundtree is so goddamn talented. [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8228.0s)]
*  He's a guy that gets focused and not focused. [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8231.0s)]
*  It's been around a long time. [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8234.0s)]
*  He used to train at Vanderlei's gym when Vanderlei had that gym in Vegas. [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8236.0s)]
*  He's a wild stories about that gym. [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8239.0s)]
*  They would just fight. [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8242.0s)]
*  Yeah, fucking fight. [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8243.0s)]
*  That's what it is. [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8244.0s)]
*  Old school, kurutiba, chutabak style. [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8245.0s)]
*  Just wail on each other. [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8247.0s)]
*  Not just to plug in my promotion for bare knuckle fighting, but I love bare knuckle fighting because grappling also feels like a little bit more realistic with no glove. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8249.0s)]
*  For some mission guys, it's a little bit more like they got that grip. [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8257.0s)]
*  They take the back, the rear naked is a little bit easier to hold. [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8260.0s)]
*  I'm a big component also for just tape the hands up and fucking go. [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8264.0s)]
*  And it serves strikers and grapplers. [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8268.0s)]
*  I agree. [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8271.0s)]
*  And I think it also gives people a much more realistic sense of what you could do with your hands. [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8272.0s)]
*  Because if you just tee off and throw wild punches and hit guys in the head, you're going to break your fucking hand. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8276.0s)]
*  It happens all the time. [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8281.0s)]
*  Gone. [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8282.0s)]
*  You're going to be much more precise in the placement of your hands. [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8283.0s)]
*  And it's never made any sense to me that why your hands are wrapped up and taped and padded, but your elbows aren't. [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8286.0s)]
*  Your shins aren't. [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8292.0s)]
*  Your knees aren't. [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8293.0s)]
*  Crazy. [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8294.0s)]
*  Crazy, right? [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8295.0s)]
*  Like sheer bone to bone. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8296.0s)]
*  Because this in power, not even that, you know, like the cuts and all that, in just sheer power. [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8298.0s)]
*  Elbows closer to your body, which is generating the power. [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8304.0s)]
*  So you know the elbow is going to be stronger. [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8306.0s)]
*  The knee is closer to your body. [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8307.0s)]
*  So you know it's generating more power than the punch. [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8309.0s)]
*  That's why in Thai boxing, they have boxing is like the least ranking for the points. [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8312.0s)]
*  You know, you kick somebody in the arm, it's almost more meaningful to them than getting punched in the face. [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8317.0s)]
*  Because the kick is a fucking kick, man. [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8322.0s)]
*  It's like baseball bat to your fucking arm and ribs. [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8324.0s)]
*  Oh, especially the way those guys throw them. [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8326.0s)]
*  And it's just, I don't know why we insist on, I mean the one thing it would be cuts. [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8328.0s)]
*  Like guys would get cut, like you see bare knuckle boxing, guys get cut up left and right. [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8334.0s)]
*  Left and right. [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8338.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8339.0s)]
*  Are you going to do bare knuckle MMA? [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8340.0s)]
*  Are you going to do a promotion with that? [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8341.0s)]
*  No, I have a promotion. [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8343.0s)]
*  Is it just bare knuckle MMA? [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8344.0s)]
*  We've put on like four or five shows already. [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8345.0s)]
*  So I thought it was bare knuckle boxing. [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8347.0s)]
*  No, no, MMA, MMA. [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8349.0s)]
*  Oh shit, you got any highlights? [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8351.0s)]
*  Let me see some of those. [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8353.0s)]
*  Yeah, we got some highlights up on YouTube. [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8354.0s)]
*  You can go to the YouTube page. [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8355.0s)]
*  So here it is. [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8356.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8357.0s)]
*  So this is your promotion? [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8358.0s)]
*  Let me see. [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8359.0s)]
*  Yep. [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8360.0s)]
*  Yeah, so I agree with that. [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8361.0s)]
*  I really feel like that's the, I feel like- [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8363.0s)]
*  This is Alex Niggas. [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8365.0s)]
*  He's a fucking mad man too, bro. [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8366.0s)]
*  I've always felt two things should change, that bare knuckle was the way to go and then [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8368.0s)]
*  two, no cage. [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8373.0s)]
*  I've been saying forever, like if you can play football on a big field, why can't you [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8374.0s)]
*  fight in a big field? [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8378.0s)]
*  If you can play basketball on a big court, why can't you fight in a big court where you [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8379.0s)]
*  can't just hold someone against a cage? [[02:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8383.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8385.0s)]
*  There's no, there's none of that. [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8386.0s)]
*  Okay. [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8387.0s)]
*  There's some, there's gotta be a way to not have a cage. [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8388.0s)]
*  I think though, but we have to have some type of- [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8390.0s)]
*  Boundary. [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8392.0s)]
*  So a guy can't, yeah, like you can't run away from it for every, you know, but definitely [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8393.0s)]
*  I do feel you in that, like just let's explore with it, see what we can do with that. [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8396.0s)]
*  Yeah, take away this additional variable, because there's a variable when your back [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8400.0s)]
*  is up against a cage and someone's pressed you here, like that shouldn't be there. [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8406.0s)]
*  Like in a natural world with no cage, you're spinning away from it, you're, and also if [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8411.0s)]
*  a guy takes you down, there's no cage to wall walk. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8416.0s)]
*  There's all sorts of variables that you introduce, and also it's easier to see. [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8419.0s)]
*  You know, like sometimes even when I'm, I'm as close as anybody gets to the fights, and [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8424.0s)]
*  sometimes I have to look at the monitor, because I can't see shit. [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8428.0s)]
*  Yeah, those poles are in your way, the freaking, where the advertisements at. [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8430.0s)]
*  It's another variable that takes away from the sport in some way. [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8434.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8438.0s)]
*  I feel like just a fucking big open space where you have to like- [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8439.0s)]
*  Like an empty pool or something, like a huge empty pool. [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8443.0s)]
*  Like a blood sport. [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8446.0s)]
*  But even in the pool, people would push you up against the side of the pool. [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8447.0s)]
*  I feel like Frank Shamrock did a thing for a while where he had a flat surface and it [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8450.0s)]
*  was curved up in the end like World Combat Fighting. [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8456.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8458.0s)]
*  Like Chuck Norris' thing that he had. [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8459.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8462.0s)]
*  Have you seen the Karate Combat Rater? [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8463.0s)]
*  Yeah, they do it like that too. [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8465.0s)]
*  I like that. [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8467.0s)]
*  Yeah, the set is fucking also beautiful. [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8468.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's pretty dope. [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8470.0s)]
*  That's Boss Rudin's thing? [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8472.0s)]
*  Yeah, Boss Rudin's the commentator on that. [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8473.0s)]
*  Wow, I would have thought that. [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8475.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8476.0s)]
*  Oh, I thought you meant like he made the- [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8477.0s)]
*  I think he's a part of it in some way. [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8478.0s)]
*  It's fucking awesome. [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8480.0s)]
*  He's always been an innovator. [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8481.0s)]
*  He moved out here too. [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8482.0s)]
*  Yeah? [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8483.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's out here too. [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8484.0s)]
*  He's always a long time LA boy, man. [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8485.0s)]
*  That's crazy. [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8486.0s)]
*  Yeah, he's like fuck this place. [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8487.0s)]
*  He's a fucking legend too. [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8488.0s)]
*  He's an animal. [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8489.0s)]
*  I love that guy. [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8490.0s)]
*  Yeah, bro. [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8491.0s)]
*  He's one of the dudes I used to look at because I would always gravitate obviously to whoever [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8492.0s)]
*  was a champion near my weight class, but like great strikers. [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8495.4s)]
*  I just fucking would soak it up. [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8499.0s)]
*  Just like what is this guy doing? [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8501.0s)]
*  How did he land that kick over and over? [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8503.0s)]
*  What little setups is he doing? [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8504.72s)]
*  So I would always digest a lot of these fucking great strikers, especially if they came from [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8506.0s)]
*  a great striking background and then translated into MMA just to like what are they doing [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8510.48s)]
*  to be able to stay afloat with these grapplers or wrestlers? [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8514.2s)]
*  Yeah, well Boss came into MMA at a time where there weren't strikers like him yet. [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8518.0s)]
*  No. [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8524.0s)]
*  He was the most elite striker at his time for sure and he was fucking people up. [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8525.0s)]
*  When he fought Tiochi Kosaka, like woo. [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8529.84s)]
*  If you couldn't take that guy down, fucking good bro. [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8533.36s)]
*  Tree chunks of legs, elbows, knees. [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8536.16s)]
*  Power. [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8538.36s)]
*  Everything was power. [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8539.36s)]
*  Everything was fucking that Dutch kickboxing style. [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8540.36s)]
*  Power. [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8543.12s)]
*  He's one of my favorite, bro. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8544.12s)]
*  Those fucking Dutchies go at him. [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8545.12s)]
*  I mean, think about Holland, the amount of killers, Ernesto Hoest, Peter Aerts, I mean, [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8546.52s)]
*  Remy Bonjasky, like so many fucking assassins, Semmy Schilt. [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8553.68s)]
*  Everybody came from Holland. [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8557.880000000001s)]
*  You know? [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8558.880000000001s)]
*  Badr Hari. [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8560.0s)]
*  Small little country. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8561.0s)]
*  Melvin Manhoef. [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8562.0s)]
*  Woo. [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8563.0s)]
*  Tyrone Spong. [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8564.0s)]
*  Yeah, so many guys came from that area. [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8565.0s)]
*  So many guys came from that style of fighting. [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8567.759999999998s)]
*  The French do pretty good too with the Thai. [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8569.64s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8571.359999999999s)]
*  They do some other good Thai guys as well. [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8572.359999999999s)]
*  Yes, definitely. [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8573.359999999999s)]
*  England as well. [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8574.359999999999s)]
*  Yes, yeah. [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8575.359999999999s)]
*  It's more. [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8576.359999999999s)]
*  Cedric Doubaix. [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8577.359999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8578.359999999999s)]
*  Woo, that motherfucker. [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8579.359999999999s)]
*  He's a bad man. [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8580.359999999999s)]
*  It's getting closer because it used to be just like, I still believe in kickboxing. [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8582.64s)]
*  Kickboxing in Holland is like fucking one of the best. [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8586.599999999999s)]
*  But like in Thai boxing and stuff, you know, like France is pretty fucking good, man. [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8589.68s)]
*  They got some killers, bro. [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8593.32s)]
*  Yes. [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8594.32s)]
*  Yes, they do. [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8595.32s)]
*  They've embraced it. [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8596.32s)]
*  It's interesting how Europeans embraced Thai fighting much earlier. [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8597.32s)]
*  And I never understood why Thai boxing never became huge in America. [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8600.720000000001s)]
*  I didn't understand it. [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8605.04s)]
*  I think boxing promoters just shut it out straight up, to be honest with you. [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8606.2s)]
*  I guess, but why is no, I mean, look, think about what the UFC has done with slap fighting, [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8609.52s)]
*  which is not really my thing. [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8614.4s)]
*  But Muay Thai, I feel like is more marketable. [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8616.4s)]
*  You get like elite Joe Schilling type strikers and have like Glory did. [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8620.68s)]
*  Glory is wild. [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8626.48s)]
*  I fucking love Glory. [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8627.48s)]
*  I just don't understand why it didn't become more popular. [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8629.039999999999s)]
*  And the only thing that makes sense to me was it wasn't promoted correctly. [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8632.039999999999s)]
*  But if you got a big promotion like the UFC's promotion machine behind world class kickboxing, [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8635.359999999999s)]
*  I think it could be as big as MMA. [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8641.0s)]
*  I think it could be as big as pro boxing. [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8642.72s)]
*  It could just be action packed. [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8645.0s)]
*  Three second clinch, break, boom, go back at it again. [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8646.599999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's what people like to watch. [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8649.519999999999s)]
*  People like to watch striking. [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8651.72s)]
*  I mean, there's a lot of casual fans. [[02:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8653.039999999999s)]
*  I mean, look, I love Jiu Jitsu, obviously, but there's something about elite striking [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8655.359999999999s)]
*  that translates to anybody and everybody. [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8660.759999999998s)]
*  You don't have to know anything. [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8662.759999999998s)]
*  You watch a dude get kicked in the face, you know exactly what happened. [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8664.119999999999s)]
*  Oh shit, that guy just died. [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8666.919999999998s)]
*  Look at this. [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8668.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8669.64s)]
*  I mean, and you see these guys and you see how one FC is doing it. [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8670.64s)]
*  I think one FC is doing it in an amazing way. [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8674.32s)]
*  They have guys like Nikki Holtzkin and Urso. [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8677.4s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8680.119999999999s)]
*  Nikki's another guy that's been in there forever. [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8682.0s)]
*  Forever. [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8685.68s)]
*  He fought Bullcow when he was like 19. [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8686.68s)]
*  Oh, he's a fucking murderer. [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8687.68s)]
*  In the K1 back then, where he was fighting the world's best. [[02:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8689.68s)]
*  And now you look at him, he's still fighting the world's best and dogging in the bad times. [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8692.64s)]
*  Fucking people up, man. [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8696.56s)]
*  And you know, when he was in glory, when he was a glory champion, I mean, my God, you [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8697.56s)]
*  just don't don't see that popularity in America. [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8701.44s)]
*  And I know glory tried for a while. [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8705.28s)]
*  I think the boxing promoters just shut it out, man. [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8706.28s)]
*  How? [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8708.800000000001s)]
*  I really feel like the UFC could have done that. [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8709.800000000001s)]
*  And I feel like maybe if the slap fighting thing doesn't work out, maybe the UFC could [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8711.44s)]
*  do that. [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8715.720000000001s)]
*  Because I think that in that you really have the potential for a whole new avenue of sport. [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8716.720000000001s)]
*  It's so accessible, so obvious to watch. [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8722.82s)]
*  It's so fun. [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8726.0s)]
*  There's so much talent. [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8727.0s)]
*  And those guys are fighting for pennies, right? [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8728.0s)]
*  You start off with them. [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8729.52s)]
*  You start off with them some real checks. [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8730.6s)]
*  Yes, that's what I'm saying. [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8732.16s)]
*  Have some elite, elite fighters over here that are fighting for millions. [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8734.52s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8738.32s)]
*  You don't hear about that in kickboxing. [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8739.32s)]
*  You know, maybe glory paying out one particular individual hundreds of thousands of dollars, [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8740.800000000001s)]
*  but you don't hear about million dollar paychecks ever for Thai boxing, for kickboxing ever. [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8745.560000000001s)]
*  Look, I mean, it hit the glory days in K1 in Japan. [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8749.24s)]
*  K1 in Japan, the Mark Hunt days. [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8753.08s)]
*  My crow copy. [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8755.68s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8756.68s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8757.68s)]
*  Those fights were fucking incredible. [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8759.48s)]
*  Those were amazing times. [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8762.32s)]
*  Peter Artz. [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8763.32s)]
*  Yes. [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8764.32s)]
*  Jerome LeBanner. [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8765.32s)]
*  Oh my God. [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8766.32s)]
*  Amazing times. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8767.32s)]
*  That guy looked like right out of a fucking movie, bro. [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8768.32s)]
*  And those motherfuckers knocked each other out all the time. [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8770.68s)]
*  And that's what I love because they would just keep fighting each other. [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8774.039999999999s)]
*  It wasn't like, oh, I beat this guy. [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8776.039999999999s)]
*  I'm never going to fight him. [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8777.199999999999s)]
*  He was like, no, we fight each other three, four times. [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8778.199999999999s)]
*  How it is. [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8780.199999999999s)]
*  If you're the best, fight the best. [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8781.199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8783.199999999999s)]
*  I mean, and it's so, I just don't understand. [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8784.199999999999s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8787.199999999999s)]
*  It's not like it's a bad product. [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8788.92s)]
*  Bullcow running through everybody. [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8789.92s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8790.92s)]
*  Teeping people in the fucking face all the way to the finals, bro. [[02:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8791.92s)]
*  That left kick. [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8794.52s)]
*  Oh, whap. [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8795.52s)]
*  We grew up on the same shit. [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8796.52s)]
*  It was not no party, not no girl, not no. [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8798.28s)]
*  When it was like K1 or Pride was on, nothing mattered. [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8801.68s)]
*  Just stuck on stupid, bro. [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8806.68s)]
*  Like I watched paint dry all fucking day when it came to that shit. [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8807.68s)]
*  It was just fucking everything, bro. [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8810.400000000001s)]
*  And the fights were fucking incredible. [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8812.720000000001s)]
*  To this day, if you go back and watch Mr. Perfect, when Anesto was in his prime and [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8815.16s)]
*  he would throw that left hook to the body and that right low kick, my God. [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8820.68s)]
*  You've seen all the tape. [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8825.64s)]
*  You've seen a hundred fights. [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8826.64s)]
*  He's going to low kick you. [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8827.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8828.64s)]
*  And he's going to throw left hook, but you're not going to stop it, bro. [[02:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8829.64s)]
*  You're not going to stop it. [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8831.8s)]
*  The timing, the setup, the everything. [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8832.8s)]
*  Everything. [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8833.8s)]
*  This is crazy with the Bob Sapp fights, right? [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8834.8s)]
*  I know. [[02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8836.8s)]
*  Bob was too big. [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8837.8s)]
*  Bob was too big. [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8838.8s)]
*  But then Kroll Cop got him handling him and Anesto always handled Kroll Cop like three [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8840.2s)]
*  different times. [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8844.119999999999s)]
*  Well, Kroll Cop broke his eyeball with one punch. [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8846.08s)]
*  He caught him with that straight left. [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8848.320000000002s)]
*  Kroll Cop, he translated so well to MMA because he was so explosive. [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8850.2s)]
*  Like Kroll Cop was so fast and so explosive. [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8855.44s)]
*  And he must have been a strong guy too because he got in there with some grapplers and he [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8857.640000000001s)]
*  could fucking fend them off. [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8860.560000000001s)]
*  He must have just naturally been like a sturdy motherfucker. [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8861.76s)]
*  Oh, he was strong as fuck. [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8864.0s)]
*  And then it's crazy. [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8865.320000000002s)]
*  He gets killed by Gonzaga, right? [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8866.320000000002s)]
*  I know. [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8868.68s)]
*  And he got Kroll Copped. [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8869.68s)]
*  Fuck. [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8870.68s)]
*  He basically got Kroll Copped. [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8871.68s)]
*  Gonzaga worked him over so bad before that elbowed the shit out of him on the ground. [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8873.24s)]
*  I think he was already loopy by the time he got up. [[02:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8877.2s)]
*  But still crazy that that's the technique you've been landing on everybody and somebody [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8879.68s)]
*  caught you with it and that somebody's not like a decorate. [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8883.28s)]
*  Like you couldn't, in a kickboxing match, you know he couldn't even hold Kroll Cop's [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8886.0s)]
*  jockstrap but in a fight anything can happen, bro. [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8890.16s)]
*  I know. [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8893.56s)]
*  That was a crazy kick too. [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8894.56s)]
*  Boom. [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8896.720000000001s)]
*  Shin to the dome. [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8897.720000000001s)]
*  And to see Kroll Cop fold and go out like that, I was like, oh my God. [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8898.720000000001s)]
*  He looked like he destroyed his knee on the way down. [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8903.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8905.52s)]
*  New ACLs needed now. [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8906.52s)]
*  Yeah it's, I just don't understand why no one's figured out how to do it right. [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8908.92s)]
*  It just makes sense. [[02:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8914.720000000001s)]
*  I mean, the fact that the UFC is involved in the slap fighting thing, which was like, [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8915.720000000001s)]
*  I guess easy to promote because it's easy to watch but is it any more easy than kickboxing? [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8919.720000000001s)]
*  And kickboxing makes more sense to me. [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8924.56s)]
*  It's like it fits in to combat sports. [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8926.960000000001s)]
*  It's more like strategy oriented, athlete versus athlete. [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8930.08s)]
*  Solving puzzles. [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8935.2s)]
*  These guys have been 7, 8 years old already in the gym giving it all they got. [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8936.2s)]
*  And if we're talking about Thai guys, they're 20 years old and they have 250 fights. [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8939.84s)]
*  Why not, right? [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8945.2s)]
*  Yeah I don't get it. [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8947.12s)]
*  I mean, just to me it's one of the great mysteries of combat sports why Muay Thai hasn't become [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8948.12s)]
*  more famous in America. [[02:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8953.92s)]
*  Because it's fucking exciting. [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8956.0s)]
*  Like when one FC puts on those Muay Thai fights, like Jesus Christ man, that's one of the most [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8957.56s)]
*  exciting fights. [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8962.4s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8963.4s)]
*  Especially like the Mighty Mouse crossover versus Raw Tang. [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8964.4s)]
*  I short circuit every time. [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8969.4s)]
*  It's like fucking I'm foaming at them. [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8970.6s)]
*  I have to see what one round is going to be all striking or no. [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8971.960000000001s)]
*  Another round is going to be everything involved. [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8974.6s)]
*  I fucking lose my mind. [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8976.08s)]
*  And hats off to Mighty Mouse for doing that because Raw Tang is not a guy I want to get [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8977.68s)]
*  in front of bro. [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8981.72s)]
*  That guy is fucking good man. [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8982.72s)]
*  He's fucking good. [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8984.72s)]
*  That just shows you everybody can have their favorite of all time. [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8986.519999999999s)]
*  I think on a technical level Mighty Mouse might be hands down the best fighter I've [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8988.8s)]
*  ever seen. [[02:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8994.88s)]
*  I think on a technical level you're correct. [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8995.88s)]
*  I think on an accomplishment level it's John Jones. [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=8996.88s)]
*  Because I think John Jones fought tougher guys. [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9001.279999999999s)]
*  I think Mighty Mouse was running through everybody but other than Sahudo and Benavides and a [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9003.679999999998s)]
*  couple other guys, they weren't really on his level. [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9009.519999999999s)]
*  But also the way he beat Mighty Mouse beat guys like arm barring Brazilian Jiu Jitsu [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9012.28s)]
*  black belt world champions. [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9016.880000000001s)]
*  Legitimate. [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9018.480000000001s)]
*  What's his name? [[02:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9019.480000000001s)]
*  The guy that he arm barred that legitimately won a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu world champion. [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9020.480000000001s)]
*  Is that Wilson? [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9026.2s)]
*  Wilson Hayes? [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9027.2s)]
*  Yes bro. [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9028.2s)]
*  And he's a legit, not some bullshit overnight company. [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9029.2s)]
*  No he's a legit world champion. [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9032.2s)]
*  And for you to arm bar that guy, fuck bro. [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9034.240000000002s)]
*  Your technique is so on point. [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9036.800000000001s)]
*  Mighty can do it all. [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9038.640000000001s)]
*  He can do it all. [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9039.92s)]
*  Just sucks he's 125. [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9041.6s)]
*  I know that's the problem. [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9043.24s)]
*  He's 5'3, fights at 125. [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9044.48s)]
*  Because he was finishing guys too bro and just exciting from the thing. [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9046.12s)]
*  When I do a checklist, can this guy throw body kick? [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9049.52s)]
*  Can this guy throw left hook? [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9052.44s)]
*  Does he have good defense? [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9053.960000000001s)]
*  He checks off on all the boxes. [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9055.08s)]
*  All the boxes. [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9056.76s)]
*  And the footwork and the movement and the speed and the execution. [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9057.76s)]
*  Endurance is never a question. [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9060.32s)]
*  Never. [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9061.960000000001s)]
*  Never a question. [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9062.960000000001s)]
*  And the thing about those light guys is it's all technique. [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9063.960000000001s)]
*  They can go and go and go. [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9066.880000000001s)]
*  So you get to see the purest version of technique. [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9068.8s)]
*  Those engines are just different at 25'35. [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9071.72s)]
*  It's interesting though. [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9074.36s)]
*  Here's one with Ray Borg. [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9075.36s)]
*  That's a different one but that one's pretty fucking extraordinary too. [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9077.880000000001s)]
*  That's fucking amazing. [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9080.92s)]
*  The fact that he took him down with a suplex and then arm bar the shit out of him. [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9082.12s)]
*  And this was like in the fourth or fifth round so the energy that he still has pumping at [[02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9086.24s)]
*  that stage bro. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9091.16s)]
*  What's incredible to me is that 25 never got much attention. [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9092.44s)]
*  But 35 gets a lot of attention. [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9097.0s)]
*  It's only 10 pounds more. [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9098.76s)]
*  It's kind of crazy. [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9100.24s)]
*  35 has been like this chaotic, very hyped up weight class. [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9101.68s)]
*  But other than like Brandon Moreno, he gets so much love from the Mexicans obviously. [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9106.720000000001s)]
*  And then you know, Davidson Figueredo who they fought four fucking times. [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9111.800000000001s)]
*  Other than those fights there's not a lot of hype at that featherweight division. [[02:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9117.2s)]
*  For us because we're like hard chords maybe like Cejudo versus Mighty Mouse. [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9122.2s)]
*  Some of the better ones. [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9126.8s)]
*  And the second fight was close man. [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9127.8s)]
*  Yes. [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9130.28s)]
*  They could have given him the Mighty Mouse to me. [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9131.28s)]
*  Easily. [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9132.28s)]
*  It was a very close fight. [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9133.28s)]
*  It was a very close fight. [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9134.28s)]
*  So it was like those were maybe the, that I could think of like the more eveny match, [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9135.28s)]
*  contested great fights at 125. [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9140.68s)]
*  I'm very interested to see what happens when Cejudo comes back and fights Al Jame. [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9143.4s)]
*  Yeah that's happening efficiently. [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9148.2s)]
*  Yes. [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9149.2s)]
*  I think Cejudo is another one of these greats of all time bro. [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9150.2s)]
*  He could do it all. [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9153.0s)]
*  He could do it all. [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9154.0s)]
*  You're not. [[02:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9155.0s)]
*  Old medalist in wrestling. [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9156.84s)]
*  Fantastic striker. [[02:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9157.84s)]
*  You're probably not a big new sky wrestler. [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9158.84s)]
*  You know, yeah. [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9159.84s)]
*  I don't see many people being able to take him down. [[02:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9160.84s)]
*  Right and that's the problem is Al Jame's biggest strength is his grappling. [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9163.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9167.96s)]
*  So when is this one? [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9168.96s)]
*  May 8th. [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9169.96s)]
*  Newark, New Jersey. [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9170.96s)]
*  Oh shit. [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9171.96s)]
*  But is the size going to play a difference maybe? [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9172.96s)]
*  You know he could get to like some bad. [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9174.96s)]
*  Al Jame is a big fella. [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9175.96s)]
*  He's a big. [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9176.96s)]
*  He could get to some tough spots and put like a body triangle on Cejudo and then who knows [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9177.96s)]
*  right but. [[02:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9181.2s)]
*  Well he's as big as you get for 135 and he's ripped. [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9182.2s)]
*  He's got a heavy wingspan arms. [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9185.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9186.64s)]
*  It's just I think on the feet I think Cejudo has an advantage. [[02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9187.64s)]
*  The power. [[02:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9191.32s)]
*  The power that nobody at 25 and 35 has Cejudo generates it bro. [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9192.32s)]
*  Well when he went through dominant crews like that I was like oh my god. [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9196.32s)]
*  Just smashing those legs. [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9199.32s)]
*  Just smashing those legs and just stops him and beats him up. [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9201.32s)]
*  That was pretty fucking extraordinary. [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9205.32s)]
*  Pretty fucking extraordinary. [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9207.32s)]
*  That whole weight class is filled with assassins. [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9208.32s)]
*  You got Cheeto Vera this weekend. [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9211.32s)]
*  That's my boy man. [[02:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9213.32s)]
*  Sanhagen. [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9214.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9215.32s)]
*  Cheeto Vera is a bad motherfucker. [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9216.32s)]
*  The way he KO'd Dominic was wild. [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9217.32s)]
*  That's this weekend kids. [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9220.32s)]
*  That's a big one. [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9222.32s)]
*  Great calf kicks. [[02:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9224.32s)]
*  Right down the street too. [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9225.32s)]
*  Good Jiu Jitsu. [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9226.32s)]
*  Oh he's got everything. [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9227.32s)]
*  Good defensive wrestling. [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9228.32s)]
*  And motherfuckers so disciplined. [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9229.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9231.32s)]
*  Cheeto is so disciplined. [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9232.32s)]
*  I mean every day he's putting in long miles, hard training, keeps getting better, focused, [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9233.32s)]
*  eyes on the prize. [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9239.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9240.32s)]
*  And Sanhagen is like this new breed that he's good everywhere. [[02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9241.32s)]
*  He's got flying knees. [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9244.32s)]
*  The way he did Franky I was surprised. [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9246.32s)]
*  I was like fuck bro this dude is beyond the truth. [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9248.32s)]
*  He's legit bro. [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9251.32s)]
*  He's going to be here for a minute bro. [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9252.32s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9253.32s)]
*  He's very legit. [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9254.32s)]
*  And you know a guy like that benefits so much from being in that shark tank of a division. [[02:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9255.32s)]
*  Sugar Sean O'Malley and Al Jermain and Piotr Jan. [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9260.32s)]
*  And how about Marab? [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9264.32s)]
*  Dava Swale? [[02:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9265.32s)]
*  The way he fucking ran through Piotr. [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9266.32s)]
*  I was like holy fucking shit. [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9268.32s)]
*  I'm a huge Piotr fan. [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9270.32s)]
*  Got to see him at the gym for one of his camps. [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9272.32s)]
*  He came in for like eight weeks. [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9274.32s)]
*  Just his work ethic, his meanness, his toughness. [[02:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9276.32s)]
*  So to see Marab do that to him. [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9278.32s)]
*  Marab is a motherfucker. [[02:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9280.32s)]
*  He is a motherfucker. [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9282.32s)]
*  Man that guy does not get tired. [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9283.32s)]
*  What's going on there? [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9285.32s)]
*  That's a guy that's like, you seen that documentary 14 Peaks? [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9286.32s)]
*  No. [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9289.32s)]
*  Oh yeah yeah. [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9290.32s)]
*  Nimsdyne. [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9291.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9292.32s)]
*  I had him on the podcast. [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9293.32s)]
*  That's like Marab with the lungs. [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9294.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9295.32s)]
*  No the lungs too. [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9296.32s)]
*  You just know he's born with something a little different in the gas. [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9297.32s)]
*  He's a little mutated there. [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9300.32s)]
*  Yeah a little bit. [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9302.32s)]
*  How many attempts did he put? [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9303.32s)]
*  A 40 fucking eight takedown on him. [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9304.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9306.32s)]
*  Never stopped. [[02:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9307.32s)]
*  And he's just going for them. [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9308.32s)]
*  He's punching, kicking, punching, kicking until he hits exhaustion. [[02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9309.32s)]
*  Then he shoots him for the takedown. [[02:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9311.32s)]
*  It's kind of like he's making guys fight at the E level just like him. [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9313.32s)]
*  But he functions better on E so he's just not giving you a break. [[02:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9319.32s)]
*  Punch, kick, shoot, punch, kick, shoot, shoot, shoot. [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9322.32s)]
*  And he's tired but the other guy's way more fucking tired. [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9325.32s)]
*  He's also got that immigrant mentality. [[02:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9329.32s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9331.32s)]
*  You know what Joey Diaz calls it. [[02:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9332.32s)]
*  Immigrant mentality. [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9333.32s)]
*  It's like something about that dude. [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9334.32s)]
*  He's hungry. [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9336.32s)]
*  Like there's a video of him when he was working a construction job when he had to like break [[02:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9337.32s)]
*  down walls he'd throw in spinning back kicks into walls to break them down. [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9341.039999999999s)]
*  Nice. [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9344.32s)]
*  Let's go. [[02:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9345.32s)]
*  So he's like fucking around while he's working. [[02:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9346.32s)]
*  And working a full time job and still competing as an elite fighter. [[02:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9348.32s)]
*  And now that he's at the top of the heap and he's in line for a title shot. [[02:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9352.56s)]
*  The problem is if Al Jermain beats Henry. [[02:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9356.56s)]
*  They won't fight right? [[02:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9359.56s)]
*  They won't fight. [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9360.56s)]
*  They love each other. [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9361.56s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9362.56s)]
*  But Al Jermain might go up to 45 anyway. [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9363.56s)]
*  He hates cutting that weight. [[02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9365.56s)]
*  Cejudo versus. [[02:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9367.56s)]
*  Marab. [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9368.56s)]
*  Oh my god. [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9369.56s)]
*  Well because you're talking about one of our best wrestlers going against this fucking. [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9370.56s)]
*  You know which he's naturally bigger. [[02:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9374.56s)]
*  Definitely naturally bigger than Cejudo but Cejudo has the fucking skills. [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9376.56s)]
*  He has the fucking skill set. [[02:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9380.56s)]
*  He also is the game plan master. [[02:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9382.56s)]
*  You know I talked to Mighty Mouse about him and Mighty Mouse did some training down there [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9385.56s)]
*  and he said he's never met a dude who's more meticulous about his training and what he's [[02:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9388.56s)]
*  trying to accomplish and how he has all his goals aligned. [[02:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9392.56s)]
*  He's like he was very inspirational. [[02:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9396.56s)]
*  Nice. [[02:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9398.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9399.56s)]
*  Shout out to Cejudo bro. [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9400.56s)]
*  There's so many good fights coming up man. [[02:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9401.56s)]
*  I mean and if he beats Al Jermain Sterling I don't care where you see. [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9402.56s)]
*  You gotta rank Cejudo up there on MMA Mount Rushmore bro. [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9406.56s)]
*  Oh 100 percent. [[02:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9409.56s)]
*  I think he's already there. [[02:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9410.56s)]
*  And if he goes and fights Volkonovsky like he's been saying for years. [[02:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9412.56s)]
*  That would be wild. [[02:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9415.56s)]
*  He might be if he was to beat Volkonovsky I think he'd be the greatest fighter maybe [[02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9416.56s)]
*  in my generation. [[02:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9420.56s)]
*  He would be the first guy to win three titles in three different weight classes. [[02:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9421.56s)]
*  And an Olympic gold medalist. [[02:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9424.56s)]
*  If he beats Al Jermain and an Olympic gold medalist. [[02:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9425.56s)]
*  If he beats Al Jermain and then goes up to 45 with Volkonovsky. [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9427.56s)]
*  Holy fuck. [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9431.56s)]
*  But Volkonovsky's got to get past Jair Rodriguez. [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9432.56s)]
*  Yes. [[02:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9435.56s)]

*  I know a lot of those guys well so I know how he trains. [[02:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9458.56s)]
*  He goes to elevation of like 12000 fucking feet in this Mexican like Aztec temple where [[02:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9462.56s)]
*  they used to do like ceremonies sacrifice all this crazy shit like you got to ask. [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9468.56s)]

*  I've seen the videos pictures. [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9475.56s)]
*  He trains up there. [[02:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9476.56s)]
*  Like it's 12000 fucking feet of nothing up there. [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9477.56s)]
*  Wow. [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9480.56s)]
*  You can't have a phone there nothing. [[02:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9481.56s)]
*  It's like sacred ground. [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9483.56s)]
*  So he just brings his camp. [[02:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9484.56s)]
*  He locks himself over like 8, 10 weeks. [[02:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9485.56s)]
*  And I'm not exaggerating to you in any way shape or form. [[02:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9488.56s)]
*  All he fucking does. [[02:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9491.56s)]
*  Wow. [[02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9492.56s)]
*  And he's been doing that for his last five six fights. [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9493.56s)]
*  And it's pain fucking so much dividends like he's a different guy you know. [[02:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9495.56s)]
*  And he's got a good style I think for Volkonosky the range the kids the kicks the wildness [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9500.56s)]
*  fucking weird elbows you know creativity. [[02:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9505.56s)]
*  And he's long and he's like I've worked out with him. [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9507.56s)]
*  He has this wire strength where at the beginning he didn't know wrestling so he was getting [[02:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9510.56s)]
*  beat on his positions. [[02:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9514.56s)]
*  He's with a great coach Izzy. [[02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9515.56s)]
*  Izzy style wrestling and man this fucking dude is like crazy genetic like with his like [[02:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9517.56s)]
*  strength level for wiriness he's fucking very gifted you know. [[02:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9524.56s)]
*  Mix that in there with a striking I think it's going to be fucking amazing fight. [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9527.56s)]
*  Or him versus Cejudo would be another fucking short circuiting fucking thing. [[02:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9530.56s)]
*  That would be insane. [[02:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9535.56s)]
*  Well I was very impressed with him when he fought Max Holloway because I was like look [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9536.56s)]
*  Max Holloway in that fight was in his prime and that was a very very close fight. [[02:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9539.56s)]
*  And he was fucking Max legs up. [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9545.56s)]
*  Yeah and Max is one of my favorite of all time. [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9547.56s)]
*  One of my favorite of all time. [[02:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9550.56s)]
*  Max is the man. [[02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9551.56s)]
*  He's the man. [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9552.56s)]
*  He's such a good dude too. [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9553.56s)]
*  He's such a fun guy. [[02:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9554.56s)]
*  And he's a fucking fighter. [[02:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9555.56s)]
*  He's a fucking fighter. [[02:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9556.56s)]
*  He's a fucking fighter. [[02:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9557.56s)]
*  He's a bad motherfucker right there. [[02:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9558.56s)]
*  When he fought Calvin Cater and he's like talking shit the whole time he's like I'm the [[02:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9560.56s)]
*  best boxer in the UFC. [[02:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9563.56s)]
*  He's like talking to the guys and people throwing punches at him and Calvin's throwing punches [[02:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9564.56s)]
*  at him he's just sliding out of the way. [[02:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9568.56s)]
*  And Calvin's no fucking slouch bro. [[02:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9569.56s)]
*  I think that gets a beast bro. [[02:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9570.56s)]
*  He's going to be around for a minute bro. [[02:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9571.56s)]
*  I wouldn't be surprised that guy gets a title later on down the road bro. [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9573.56s)]
*  Yeah if he can learn from those fights for sure and continue to keep improving. [[02:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9576.56s)]
*  What a division. [[02:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9581.56s)]
*  That 45 pound division is crazy. [[02:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9582.56s)]
*  45, 55, 70 it's always fucking. [[02:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9584.56s)]
*  Yeah there's so much going on. [[02:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9586.56s)]
*  Look at it. [[02:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9588.56s)]
*  He's just talking shit to him and Calvin's like what? [[02:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9589.56s)]
*  The gas tank Mike's like. [[02:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9593.56s)]
*  Look at him like moving around talking. [[02:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9594.56s)]
*  I'm the best boxer. [[02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9598.56s)]
*  Amazing. [[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9600.56s)]
*  That was an amazing fight. [[02:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9601.56s)]
*  And you know when you watch his fight with Yair I rewatched that a couple of months ago. [[02:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9605.56s)]
*  And I was just like Yair is the most dynamic kicker in the sport. [[02:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9609.56s)]
*  He's so wild. [[02:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9614.56s)]
*  Like the stuff that he does he's throwing wheel kicks. [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9616.56s)]
*  That title move back one man. [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9618.56s)]
*  Yeah he hit BJ Penn with a 360 roundhouse kick. [[02:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9619.56s)]
*  360 roundhouse kick in a fucking MMA fight to the face. [[02:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9622.56s)]
*  He can do wild shit and he can submit people. [[02:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9626.56s)]
*  And when he beat Josh with a triangle off of his back I was like god damn. [[02:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9629.56s)]
*  I worked out with him and I usually work out with 70 pounders, 85 pounders, a couple 55 pounders here at American Top Team. [[02:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9634.56s)]
*  Then we got some standouts, Greg Dawson. [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9641.56s)]
*  He has one draw and he's like on a six fight winning streak. [[02:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9644.56s)]
*  Guy's a fucking phenomenal grappler. [[02:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9648.56s)]
*  I've worked out with a lot of great grapplers throughout my time. [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9650.56s)]
*  Especially because those are the guys I choose to go with. [[02:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9653.56s)]
*  When I tell you that Yair for 45 has like unreal strength it's fucking impressive bro. [[02:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9655.56s)]
*  It's just like fucking wiry, freaky, like he's crazy long for the weight. [[02:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9660.56s)]
*  And you get him in uncomfortable spots. [[02:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9664.56s)]
*  And I think because of the taekwondo they develop like so much dexterity and rotation of muscles. [[02:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9666.56s)]
*  He could do like a split and defend takedowns and then fucking threaten submissions. [[02:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9671.56s)]
*  I've had a couple times to work out with him. [[02:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9675.56s)]
*  Kid's impressive bro. [[02:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9677.56s)]
*  Like he's not getting ran over no more by anybody in the grappling I think bro. [[02:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9678.56s)]
*  Yeah, he's wild. [[02:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9682.56s)]
*  And the Volkonowski fight is such an interesting fight because Volkonowski is such a tank. [[02:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9684.56s)]
*  Look, I thought you know. [[02:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9688.56s)]
*  Beat Eastlamp? [[02:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9690.56s)]
*  I thought he beat him. [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9691.56s)]
*  You know I watched it again over and over again. [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9692.56s)]
*  And it really comes down to that second round and I gave him an advantage in that second round. [[02:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9694.56s)]
*  I watched it many times. [[02:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9698.56s)]
*  It's kind of like we're watching a fight man. [[02:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9699.56s)]
*  Who's winning at the end? [[02:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9702.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9703.56s)]
*  Who's on top at the end? [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9704.56s)]
*  And who would you rather be at the end of the fight? [[02:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9705.56s)]
*  Exactly. [[02:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9708.56s)]
*  That's what a fight is. [[02:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9709.56s)]
*  You might out position him here and there but man I thought I was the same way. [[02:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9710.56s)]
*  But initially I felt the same way. [[02:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9715.56s)]
*  Like man maybe I'm caught up in the moment. [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9716.56s)]
*  Me too. [[02:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9718.56s)]
*  I'm a huge Vogue fan. [[02:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9719.56s)]
*  I love what Eastlamp does because he's trying to hurt guys and put them out and submit them. [[02:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9720.56s)]
*  I don't think he's like a cross. [[02:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9723.56s)]
*  He's taking guys down and trying to finish them. [[02:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9724.56s)]
*  So I like that but I really thought man I think Vogue watched it. [[02:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9726.56s)]
*  And then when I watched it the second time and it wasn't in a big group you know. [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9730.56s)]
*  It was like I still think Vogue won man. [[02:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9734.56s)]
*  And just because of the damage alone. [[02:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9736.56s)]
*  It's a fucking fight. [[02:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9738.56s)]
*  It's not a grappling match. [[02:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9739.56s)]
*  And if you dominate somebody in grappling I could give that. [[02:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9740.56s)]
*  But when you're getting stuffed. [[02:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9743.56s)]
*  When you're getting punched in the face. [[02:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9745.56s)]
*  And then the fifth round he's ending on top of you fucking. [[02:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9746.56s)]
*  Bam bam. [[02:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9748.56s)]
*  Even the round when Eastlamp had his back and Vogue just punched him in the face and [[02:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9749.56s)]
*  talking shit. [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9754.56s)]
*  Do something. [[02:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9755.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9756.56s)]
*  And it's like why is that position good? [[02:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9757.56s)]
*  It's only good if you're threatening with submissions. [[02:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9760.56s)]
*  He wasn't really threatening. [[02:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9762.56s)]
*  Or if you're threatening with punches or something. [[02:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9763.56s)]
*  If you're just fucking. [[02:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9765.56s)]
*  You're doing everything possible to negate. [[02:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9766.56s)]
*  A fight. [[02:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9768.56s)]
*  And that. [[02:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9769.56s)]
*  If I was a judge I would always look at it like you're doing everything in your power [[02:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9770.56s)]
*  not to fight. [[02:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9773.56s)]
*  It's kind of stalling. [[02:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9774.56s)]
*  It's kind of stalling. [[02:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9775.56s)]
*  It's not. [[02:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9776.56s)]
*  It's 100% stalling. [[02:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9777.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9778.56s)]
*  You know what won't be stalling? [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9779.56s)]
*  Is Adesanya and Pahara two. [[02:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9781.56s)]
*  No no no no. [[02:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9784.56s)]
*  Three. [[02:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9785.56s)]
*  Four. [[02:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9786.56s)]
*  What is it now? [[02:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9787.56s)]
*  Four. [[02:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9788.56s)]
*  Well two kickboxing. [[02:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9789.56s)]
*  And two MMA. [[02:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9790.56s)]
*  So this would be two in MMA. [[02:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9791.56s)]
*  This is the second fight in the UFC. [[02:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9792.56s)]
*  That's the fucking fight man. [[02:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9794.56s)]
*  My God. [[02:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9796.56s)]
*  That was one of my favorite fights I've seen. [[02:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9797.56s)]
*  I think it was like some of the best stand that we've seen in a while in MMA. [[02:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9799.56s)]
*  Oh for sure. [[02:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9804.56s)]
*  You know. [[02:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9805.56s)]
*  For sure. [[02:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9806.56s)]
*  Is he so creative. [[02:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9807.56s)]
*  Athletic has crazy experience in it. [[02:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9808.56s)]
*  And Pereira is like a fucking Terminator bro. [[02:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9809.56s)]
*  He obviously has all the skillset in the world. [[02:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9811.56s)]
*  But I see that guy on my bus. [[02:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9813.56s)]
*  The fucking Terminator right there bro. [[02:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9815.56s)]
*  He's a scary dude. [[02:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9816.56s)]
*  And he's so big. [[02:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9817.56s)]
*  Coming right out of the Amazon doesn't give a fuck about the world. [[02:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9818.56s)]
*  Yeah right out of the Amazon. [[02:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9820.56s)]
*  I'm gonna fuck you up bro. [[02:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9822.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9823.56s)]
*  I mean literally his nickname, Poetan, is that language of his tribe. [[02:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9824.56s)]
*  You see him when he dresses up in the traditional garb. [[02:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9829.56s)]
*  And when he walks out and he fucking draws the bow back. [[02:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9832.56s)]
*  Yes. [[02:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9835.56s)]
*  And he's like, haaaah. [[02:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9836.56s)]
*  Oh I fucking love it bro. [[02:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9837.56s)]
*  He doesn't give a fuck about the world. [[02:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9838.56s)]
*  This thing is nice. [[02:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9840.56s)]
*  This is who I am. [[02:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9841.56s)]
*  Get ready for the world. [[02:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9842.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9843.56s)]
*  He's such a knockout artist too. [[02:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9844.56s)]
*  Even in kickboxing. [[02:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9845.56s)]
*  That motherfucker is so scary. [[02:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9846.56s)]
*  That's an iconic picture right there man. [[02:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9847.56s)]
*  Look at that. [[02:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9848.56s)]
*  He brought it back to the village. [[02:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9849.56s)]
*  His title to his indigenous regimen. [[02:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9850.56s)]
*  Back to Brazil. [[02:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9851.56s)]
*  Incredible. [[02:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9852.56s)]
*  That's incredible. [[02:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9853.56s)]
*  I'm fucking pumped for that man. [[02:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9854.56s)]
*  That's a skip. [[02:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9855.56s)]
*  But Izzy almost had him. [[02:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9856.56s)]
*  First round. [[02:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9857.56s)]
*  Whoooo. [[02:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9858.56s)]
*  To fight with a busted eardrum because he was bleeding out his fucking eardrum. [[02:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9859.56s)]
*  It looked like a rare. [[02:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9860.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9861.56s)]
*  So one of the worst things that could happen to you in the first round is your equilibrium [[02:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9862.56s)]
*  get fucking killed like that. [[02:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9863.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9864.56s)]
*  Who do you got in the. [[02:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9865.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9866.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9867.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9868.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9869.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9870.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9871.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9872.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9873.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9874.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9875.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9876.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9877.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9878.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9880.56s)]
*  I mean look if Izzy can catch him again but catch him earlier like where he's got time [[02:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9881.56s)]
*  to put him away it can happen. [[02:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9886.16s)]
*  That was the I mean that was the most hurt anybody did. [[02:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9889.08s)]
*  Even though Pajeda stopped him he stopped him with like a big barrage of shots. [[02:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9892.76s)]
*  Izzy cracked him. [[02:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9897.88s)]
*  And he had that dude on Queer Street. [[02:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9898.88s)]
*  And then he hit him with that left hook like at the buzzer. [[02:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9902.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9905.6s)]
*  No another five seconds. [[02:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9906.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9907.6s)]
*  Another five seconds the fight is over and Izzy's such a sharp shooter. [[02:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9908.640000000001s)]
*  But man Pajeda got him. [[02:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9912.6s)]
*  Like you can't take that away. [[02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9914.720000000001s)]
*  I mean Izzy was winning that fight but Pajeda took it all away in the fifth round. [[02:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9916.0s)]
*  So who fucking knows man. [[02:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9921.44s)]
*  I'm just going to be. [[02:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9922.44s)]
*  And it's very intriguing to me because Izzy's defensive wrestling is pretty on point. [[02:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9923.44s)]
*  You know he's demonstrated over the time he has a great defense you know numbers wise. [[02:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9927.640000000001s)]
*  Pereira I don't know how well he'll do against a lot of these other guys that are going to [[02:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9931.84s)]
*  be like I'm not striking with you bro. [[02:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9935.08s)]
*  Right. [[02:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9936.52s)]
*  You know you can dive for your legs. [[02:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9937.52s)]
*  It's going to be interesting to see because you could see on the ground he's not efficient. [[02:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9938.52s)]
*  Yeah he's not you know he's a tough motherfucker. [[02:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9942.2s)]
*  But yeah he doesn't know quite what he's doing to have wrist control on him. [[02:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9944.44s)]
*  He's a little bit lost in some positions. [[02:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9948.08s)]
*  When Izzy had his back he looked lost. [[02:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9949.92s)]
*  And you got to imagine if Robert Whittaker gets his back like that. [[02:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9952.560000000001s)]
*  That's a real problem. [[02:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9955.4s)]
*  Yeah and Whittaker could wrestle defensively offensively. [[02:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9956.4s)]
*  Now imagine Eblen coming up to 85 in the UFC. [[02:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9959.32s)]
*  Imagine him leaving Bellator and his contract is up. [[02:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9964.2s)]
*  That kind of that quality of wrestler. [[02:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9967.0s)]
*  I'm putting my money on it. [[02:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9969.16s)]
*  Eblen beats everybody at UFC. [[02:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9970.68s)]
*  I've been I've been advocating for this guy for a while because I fucking lived it with [[02:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9972.68s)]
*  him. [[02:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9977.44s)]
*  I've gone to war with him. [[02:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9978.44s)]
*  I've seen what he does against top notch wrestlers. [[02:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9979.44s)]
*  I never like to mention names but I've seen this guy crush the best of the best. [[02:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9981.560000000001s)]
*  Doesn't matter what discipline they're in. [[02:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9986.44s)]
*  Everybody comes to the America Top Team at some point and I've seen this guy just go [[02:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9987.44s)]
*  to fucking war with people and put him on. [[02:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9990.880000000001s)]
*  I believe it. [[02:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9993.640000000001s)]
*  I believe it because the way he handled Musasi on the feet. [[02:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9994.76s)]
*  That's when the whole world came to find out. [[02:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9997.039999999999s)]
*  But going into that fight I'm a huge Musasi fan. [[02:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=9998.76s)]
*  Musasi is a bad motherfucker. [[02:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=10001.359999999999s)]
*  Classy dude bro. [[02:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=10003.56s)]
*  I was really bummed out when he left the UFC. [[02:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=10004.56s)]
*  I was like god damn it. [[02:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=10006.56s)]
*  It was kind of weird. [[02:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=10008.039999999999s)]
*  They didn't appreciate him enough. [[02:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=10009.599999999999s)]
*  They didn't. [[02:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=10011.76s)]
*  And he has a great fucking style bro. [[02:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=10012.76s)]
*  Oh amazing style. [[02:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=10014.199999999999s)]
*  With the Bellator crush and then just I'm telling you Johnny's a problem in more ways [[02:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=10015.199999999999s)]
*  than one. [[02:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=10018.8s)]
*  I believe it. [[02:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=10019.8s)]
*  He's fucking I think he'd be Pereira right now or Izzy bro. [[02:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=10020.8s)]
*  But man I'm telling you Johnny Eberlein is the fucking truth. [[02:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=10025.48s)]
*  Is he happy at Bellator? [[02:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=10029.0s)]
*  Can he be coaxed? [[02:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=10030.84s)]
*  I know he earns a nice check at Bellator. [[02:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=10033.96s)]
*  I'm sure Bellator's got to keep people there. [[02:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=10035.779999999999s)]
*  They have to spend that money. [[02:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=10038.14s)]
*  But you know like everybody man you want to say I'm the number one without question and [[02:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=10040.38s)]
*  doubt if they're saying those guys over there are the best I want to fucking that's something [[02:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=10044.38s)]
*  that I wish UFC here and there would at least do every once in a while. [[02:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=10048.26s)]
*  Just bring them over for one fight. [[02:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=10052.66s)]

*  Remember when they had Vandele come over and Chuck and then Chuck went over to Pride and [[02:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=10057.039999999999s)]
*  fought in Pride when he was a star in the UFC and he got beat in Pride but then they [[02:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=10061.119999999999s)]
*  wouldn't let anybody come over here and then the UFC had to buy Pride and then it turns [[02:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=10065.84s)]
*  out they weren't even buying Pride they were just buying a digital library and the fucking [[02:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=10069.64s)]
*  the whole thing was a mess. [[02:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=10074.519999999999s)]

*  In my eyes. [[02:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=10087.42s)]
*  I mean I feel like the only thing that comes close to me is Kane Velasquez in his prime. [[02:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=10088.42s)]
*  Kane Velasquez in his prime was a juggernaut. [[02:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=10092.74s)]
*  He just would not stop and his cardio was just insanity. [[02:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=10094.94s)]
*  He'd be the guy to like challenge like an Ingano in his prime. [[02:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=10097.62s)]
*  I know they fought but like in his prime like nine attempts per round for takedown. [[02:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=10100.54s)]
*  It's like when we talk about MaRab like that crazy gas tank almost like born with it that's [[02:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=10104.74s)]

*  Oh my god. [[02:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=10113.68s)]
*  Fedor though just had like uncanny ability to take you off your feet whether it was like [[02:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=10114.68s)]
*  a sambo throw or like a fucking right hand and then he'd like cross body like lock you [[02:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=10118.32s)]
*  and fucking dump you in your head and then the meanest ground and pound that we've seen [[02:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=10123.56s)]
*  bro. [[02:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=10127.4s)]
*  His striking was so good and he walked down crow cop. [[02:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=10128.4s)]
*  Most of that fight was a stand up fight and he's fighting one of the baddest motherfuckers [[02:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=10130.52s)]
*  to ever kickbox. [[02:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=10134.4s)]
*  No Fedor in his prime. [[02:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=10135.4s)]
*  He was special. [[02:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=10138.04s)]
*  When they'd show like the pride fights were like what Friday or something like that. [[02:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=10139.04s)]

*  the fights live from Japan. [[02:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=10153.1s)]

*  sense since the early 1990s. [[02:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=10170.880000000001s)]

*  I mean and this is what has become the biggest most popular sport now but it took the UFC [[02:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=10184.2s)]
*  spending all that money. [[02:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=10188.960000000001s)]

*  Yeah. [[02:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQO9obvNhUo&t=10193.6s)]
