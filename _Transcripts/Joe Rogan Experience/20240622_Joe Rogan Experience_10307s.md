*  Trapped I don't like being trapped in this Apple ecosystem, and I'll tell you something this fucking phone live with live [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=0.0s)]
*  This phone does so much more first of all the anti glare the fact that the screen doesn't know it has anti glare on it [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=8.88s)]
*  So much better outside crystal clear you read everything crystal clear [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=16.02s)]
*  I fucking love this circle to search thing so like if you have a cool pair of sneakers on I can take a photo of [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=20.740000000000002s)]
*  Do a little circle of it on my phone and immediately pops up on Google all the places to buy it damn [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=27.900000000000002s)]
*  It shows you what things yes, dude it here's another one my notes like say if I do [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=32.82s)]
*  Like a show and I record it it will transcribe [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=40.5s)]
*  The entire set and it will summarize it for us pretty gangster what yes, it'll summarize it for me [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=45.02s)]
*  It also will summarize websites, so there's a website. You know oh what's going on in Russia some crazy shit is happening [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=50.7s)]
*  I say summarize that cliff notes it summarizes it for you god damn dude apple doesn't do it either [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=56.94s)]
*  Fantastic camera the cameras have always been better [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=64.89999999999999s)]
*  They've always been better better to say better because I have both I'm gonna tell you something they're both awesome [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=67.42s)]
*  It's better at certain the iPhone camera is fucking awesome. Let's be honest though. You've never taken a picture of an iPhone like I wish it was better [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=71.34s)]
*  Nope never never [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=78.74s)]
*  No [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=80.97999999999999s)]
*  But if you are like one of those crazy professional photographers one thing this does do is it zooms way better way better [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=83.89999999999999s)]
*  The zoom is crystal clear you can read a sign [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=90.86s)]
*  Like way in the distance where I've zoomed in with this and I can see it [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=93.78s)]
*  But I can't read the letters and then with this phone with the Samsung. I see the letters crystal clear [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=97.69999999999999s)]
*  I think the iPhone is a better camera for just whipping it out and taking a picture [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=102.41999999999999s)]
*  But you can do more with the Android [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=106.17999999999999s)]
*  I don't even know if it's a better camera for taking it out and whipping a picture. I think they're equal [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=108.22000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think for taking it out whipping a picture. It's equal, but this thing has so many more options [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=112.14s)]
*  There's all these options [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=118.02000000000001s)]
*  He's always shown me about like we have to go where's that it's in the settings like if you're not into fucking around with things [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=118.78s)]
*  Get an iPhone, but if you're like me and you're like really into tech stuff androids [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=123.9s)]
*  but also shoot like the with the the [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=127.98s)]

*  But cigarettes like he was like, oh his books got super boring. Hey, they didn't they weren't as good [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=604.92s)]
*  Yes, he said he doesn't remember writing Cujo. That's why it's so good [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=610.7199999999999s)]
*  Yep [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=614.4599999999999s)]
*  And then he said this he came he came his wife came in and she said, you know [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=614.8399999999999s)]
*  She started cleaning up cans and he goes God I kept cans everywhere [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=619.2399999999999s)]
*  How long when's the last time we clean this place and she goes and it was literally the whole place is covered with beer cans [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=623.64s)]
*  And she goes this is the past three days and he was like, I'm drinking hot. He didn't even realize it [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=629.36s)]
*  Yeah, well if you want to be good. Yeah [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=636.2s)]
*  You want to really write the kind of shit that he wrote when he was young you got to push that motherfucking um [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=639.5600000000001s)]
*  Well, he can't do anything. No, no, he said he actually in his book said I was a very creative guy who had a substance abuse problem [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=645.36s)]
*  It's not that I had a substance abuse problem and therefore I was creative [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=652.28s)]
*  He said don't get it twisted because I always had a great imagination, but I just [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=654.6s)]
*  I don't know. I'm I am of a belief that it helps you [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=660.0s)]
*  I really am not but I do think that it's a personality type so it might go hand-in-hand right with an extreme sort of [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=663.96s)]
*  You know, it all comes together. Maybe maybe I think it opens up doors in your imagination that will stay closed [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=670.52s)]
*  Yeah, you can't get them [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=677.52s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I've never fucked with cocaine but he was a big cocaine user and like the shining was all on cocaine great movie [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=680.52s)]
*  fucking great fantastic [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=686.92s)]
*  The book is insane [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=688.96s)]
*  He didn't like the movie. He felt like Jack Nicholson was too crazy too quick [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=690.56s)]
*  Yeah, he thought like in the movie the guy becomes crazy guys [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=695.04s)]
*  I got normal dude who becomes crazy during during the the staying at the overlook that was shot in Colorado [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=698.4s)]
*  So here we go first fight [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=706.1600000000001s)]
*  Vulcan owes Demir and who's he fighting Johnny Walker? [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=708.5600000000001s)]
*  I can the hell if I do bet the odds are even on this the odd makers went somebody's getting knocked out [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=711.12s)]
*  Johnny Walker can knock out anybody. How does he get down to a five, please? It's so hard to believe he's so big [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=715.6s)]
*  When you stand next to him, he's massive like he easily could be a heavyweight [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=721.5600000000001s)]
*  Dude, I want it'd be fun if Johnny Walker wins this one. Can you imagine him and Alex? [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=725.2800000000001s)]
*  That's a motherfucking fight. Yeah, but is that possible? Why not? [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=729.7600000000001s)]
*  Neanderthal forehead. Yeah, he's a big fella. Why not Joe because I don't think he's one enough. I don't think any it's compelling [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=734.16s)]
*  He would have to beat like a Jamal Hill correct to beat [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=740.9200000000001s)]
*  I'm not saying next I'm saying I hope he wins and continues to win. Yeah, he's about two away from it at light heavyweight [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=745.24s)]
*  You went to big fights. You're there bro, right? It's like one step below heavyweight. Yeah, like look at Yuri [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=751.48s)]
*  He won one fight now. He's back. Yep. Yeah, I have you it's pretty why didn't why didn't [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=756.08s)]
*  Uncle I have get that fight. That's a good question [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=761.6800000000001s)]
*  They might have yeah, he's very good. I don't know why right they might have offered him that fight and he might have said no [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=765.72s)]
*  They might have thought that his fight with Jan Bojo, which was boring. I [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=771.64s)]
*  Disagree heavily. I think Jan Bojo which is a fucking animal [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=776.1600000000001s)]
*  And if you want to like survive against Jan Bojo, which you got to fight smart [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=780.0s)]
*  Yep, like you can't ask a guy to fight stupid just so everybody can cheer [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=784.1s)]
*  But to Dana White's point like it's a business of entertainment too, right but he looked entertaining in all of his other fights [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=788.2s)]
*  I just think it's a draw before that bro with who? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=793.6800000000001s)]
*  And Clive had a draw before that. Who do you have with yawn? Oh, but again, yon bohovich fucking animal [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=796.9200000000001s)]
*  four minutes and 30 seconds for 29 for 28 for 27 for 26 if you want to sync it up like I like what [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=803.32s)]
*  The UFC did with Izzy, right? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=811.0s)]
*  He's coming off a loss and then he's been out what a year at least and then they're giving him a title shot [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=812.96s)]
*  I think that's what makes the UFC the UFC because they're going no [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=818.48s)]
*  No, we're not just giving to the guy title shot who we think is next like what Izzy did his body of work [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=821.48s)]
*  You can lose one and still be a huge draw. Let's do one between fucking UFC and boxing. That's true [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=828.4s)]
*  But if that's true, why didn't Sean get the rematch because Sean won that fight? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=834.96s)]
*  I thought I thought it was very close, but I thought Strickland should have got the decision [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=839.16s)]
*  If you're if you're a purist, which I'm both right [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=843.68s)]
*  I get the business entertainment side in the purist if you're purist Sean Strickland 100% should be next and he beat [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=847.6s)]
*  Paulo Costa I thought he beat Drikus as well [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=854.24s)]
*  But the thing is about Drikus is that's the fight if these guys are angry at each other, you know [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=858.06s)]
*  It's like a lot of hype. It's a good fight to sell. Yeah all that shit talking when it [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=863.48s)]
*  Get more views than a Strickland rematch maybe [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=868.52s)]
*  Strickland's a big fucking star man. He's a so awkward dude [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=872.6s)]
*  His style is he and there's a story with it. He's up right now. Yeah, oh American crack [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=876.4s)]
*  The problem with Johnny Walker is he's been KO'd a gang of times. Yeah, his defense is suspect [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=882.64s)]
*  Usually a lot of guys have put him away [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=887.64s)]
*  Yeah, he didn't he win his last fight on a disqual DQ. I don't know the Jamal one was crazy [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=890.64s)]
*  Jamal hit him on the forehead and his hands flew up in the air and he went oh there it is [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=896.6800000000001s)]
*  There it is. He got rocked. I got he's in trouble. He's in trouble. He's in trouble already. Oh, it was Demare might get him [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=901.36s)]
*  He's letting him get him against the cage like that. Get out of the way, bro. He's got to get out of there [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=906.82s)]
*  He's in trouble. He's in real trouble. Oh [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=910.6800000000001s)]
*  A lot of wild shit. You can't do wild shit when you're really hurt. He was technically very proficient [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=914.2s)]
*  Cold out cold, but that's why I went to SPG cuz he needed to tighten up cuz he's wild [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=921.28s)]
*  Yeah, but yeah, he's this is how it's happened too many times [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=925.9599999999999s)]
*  He's just trying to be crazy just trying to do anything [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=933.78s)]
*  But you can't do that with Vulcan Vulcan owes Demare can punch so hard a certain level of the [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=937.24s)]
*  Fundamentals are gonna beat you guys are that good and owes Demare's been out for a bit, right? Yeah [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=943.26s)]
*  So, you know any of some losses too? Oh, he's had some losses. Yeah, but he's a good striker man [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=947.5999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, very very solid hands there hands he hurt him and then once Johnny Walker gets it [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=954.48s)]
*  He's I think he's just been KO'd too many times. Oh, there's that left hook. That's and once it goes it goes [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=960.3199999999999s)]
*  There's nothing you can do but this was a bad one. I mean this was he got flattened [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=965.76s)]
*  I just think Johnny Walker who had all the physical gifts, but I just didn't have the kind of fundamentals like owes Demare [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=970.26s)]
*  Well, it's yeah. Look at that boom. Good. Oh my goodness. That's how cold that's awful how cold [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=976.12s)]
*  Thing is like Johnny Walker probably sucks a lot of weight to get to 205 that definitely messes with your chin. Yeah [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=983.96s)]
*  Oh that last shots rough look at his eyes roll back in his head been there when you're sucking that much weight [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=992.84s)]
*  It's gonna fuck your brain up hundred percent clean your body of all that water and he's six six two. Oh five [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=998.3199999999999s)]
*  How good a bro good heavyweight? Yeah, go to heavyweight fucking heavyweight [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1003.9s)]
*  He might be a really good heavyweight man. And that is a shallow pool super shallow [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1008.12s)]
*  You could lose like multiple fights and there's a lot of strikers for him. Sure. Rosen's true. You know, you got a ton of guys [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1012.7s)]
*  Yeah, but now he's now that he's been he's been flatlined a lot. Yeah, it might be over [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1018.76s)]
*  I mean you gotta think all the different people that have gotten him [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1022.5400000000001s)]
*  Well, remember he was doing the worm when he won and blew his shoulder out. Yeah, that was crazy [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1026.82s)]
*  No, he so Johnny Walker's won a fight [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1030.3s)]
*  I think it was in Brazil and he started celebrating doing the worm and literally fell too hard and blew his shoulder out [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1032.9s)]
*  It was out like a year now. Yeah, have the shoulder reconstructed in the worm or shoulder [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1037.56s)]
*  Yeah for nothing you see Connors injury. Yeah thoughts well [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1042.26s)]
*  Pinky toe it's exactly what Paheta had when when he beat Jamal Hill [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1047.4599999999998s)]
*  He had a broken toe a lot of guys have had a now it's the pinky toe a lot of guys [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1051.62s)]
*  I thought with broken I knew about it in advance [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1055.04s)]
*  Look, here's the thing about a broken pinky toe when you're a guy who kicks as much as Connor [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1057.8s)]
*  It's a fucking problem hundred percent and it's also the same foot where his leg was snapped and he went into that fight injured [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1062.02s)]
*  He's never pulled out of a fight before never [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1068.46s)]
*  This is the first one he pulled out of and I think it's wise [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1070.38s)]
*  Because I think if you do have a broken toe and you are going into a fight and you did go into a fight the last [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1073.14s)]
*  Fight injured what if that fucking toe becomes a real issue? [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1078.18s)]
*  Like what if he throws a kick and it smashes again and he's in agony and he can't move [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1081.42s)]
*  I thought you and I were gonna disagree on this [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1085.78s)]
*  I couldn't agree more because and you got to realize what's on the line for Connor to like he loses this one the rides [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1087.18s)]
*  Over also, you know, why so why risk it? [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1093.22s)]
*  You got to be able to get the fuck out of the way with Michael Chandler you fuck yeah [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1095.92s)]
*  So you're not gonna go compromised and it's the leg that's already fucked up [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1098.98s)]
*  Like you want to you want your best foot forward no pun intended [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1102.8000000000002s)]
*  That's his biggest asset against Chandler you got an in and out stick move [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1108.92s)]
*  Tie that toe to the other toe you can but it's gonna be you're still not a hundo [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1114.6000000000001s)]
*  If this is Connor six years ago, he's fighting all these fight [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1120.24s)]
*  Excuse me, he fought Chad Mendes with a blown fucking knee and still beat him [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1123.5s)]
*  Yeah, and it was on short notice still beat him [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1127.4199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, so don't get it twisted like Connor's a savage and he's a fighter's fighter [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1129.86s)]
*  But this I think finally his team's like coax dude. I'm addicted [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1133.58s)]
*  Yeah boys we got more [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1139.6999999999998s)]
*  The only person drinks more diet coke [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1142.3s)]

*  They don't know their audience. Yeah, that's what they didn't know initially. It came out and it was the champagne of beers [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1194.06s)]
*  How do we get women to drink beer called the champagne of beer? [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1198.4599999999998s)]

*  Overeating is always a problem. But calories from saturated fat are not a problem [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1269.86s)]
*  Cholesterol is what creates myelin which is literally what the fucking brain is made out of cholesterol is responsible for all your hormone production [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1275.26s)]

*  Recently he had one site. Okay, that's another great fight [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1359.06s)]
*  Yeah, I want to see if he gets away with all the shit [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1363.48s)]
*  Well, he's gonna fight in Jane Gary [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1367.5s)]
*  Tall and really but I don't think he's gonna be able to hit that dude [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1371.0s)]
*  You don't know I disagree Michael Van and Paige is a different thing. I'll put his lights up. You think so [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1373.96s)]
*  Really? Yeah, I think he gares the next he's it man [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1381.08s)]
*  Talented I think he's sensational, but he's been hit before and he's got rocked and dropped Michael Van and Paige is a different thing [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1385.32s)]
*  Mike Van Pagan hit before to right right by Diego Lima, correct [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1392.4s)]
*  Yeah [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1400.12s)]
*  Interesting. Yeah, I like Paige, but I think in Gary's that guy [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1401.32s)]
*  I think he's gonna have a really hard time finding that guy, you know, and I saw the Kevin Holland fight [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1404.48s)]
*  Yep, he was like where the fuck is he he couldn't find him couldn't even touch him [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1409.76s)]
*  He's such at that point elite point fighting style with all the MMA skills that Michael Van and Paige has [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1413.92s)]
*  That is one of the most puzzling problems to deal with inside the octagon. Look at Alex thriving [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1420.84s)]
*  Yeah thriving right but it's not [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1427.0s)]
*  Alex is not a point fighter. It's not a different style. Yeah, I'm just saying his elite level of striking makes up for the other holes [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1430.0800000000002s)]
*  Sure [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1435.7600000000002s)]
*  But we've had elite strikers before the difference with Michael Van and Paige's Michael Van and Paige is an elite point fighter [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1436.1200000000001s)]
*  His style of hitting and not getting hit and being able to close distance really fast fucking nobody's like that [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1442.2800000000002s)]
*  Wonderboy closest close but not at that level at that level [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1449.3600000000001s)]
*  Wonderboy was a kickboxer very elite striker very elite kickboxer [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1452.92s)]
*  But the difference between kickboxing and point fighting is that blitz that blitz and Michael Van and Paige is so unorthodox [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1457.68s)]
*  I think that could be one of those fights [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1464.8000000000002s)]
*  Remember when Francis and Derek Lewis were gonna fight and we're like bro, this fight's going one minute get ready [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1467.5200000000002s)]
*  And it went to a decision so boring, right? [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1473.2s)]
*  Sometimes when you have those two high-level strikers and it's that style. I'm not saying it's gonna be born [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1476.0800000000002s)]
*  There's a chance can be really fucking boring cuz so calculated so strategic and neither guy wants to engage [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1481.16s)]
*  Michael don't do all these things never been in a boring fight in his fucking life. He's amazing Michael Van and Paige is [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1487.24s)]
*  He's great don't be wrong, but some of those bellator ones were tough I'm interested I'll tell you what you might be right [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1496.24s)]
*  You might be wrong. I'm interested. Yeah. Yeah [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1501.44s)]
*  I just think that he is the most difficult puzzle on the feet [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1503.44s)]
*  I've ever seen hard to find a guy who can spar like him to [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1507.72s)]
*  Do a fucking thing to him right couldn't do a fucking thing. Yeah, and Holland is a good striker a very good striker [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1511.72s)]
*  I mean, he's a complete fighter Kevin [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1518.24s)]
*  But he's a very good striker and he didn't even come close to hitting him. That dude was just not there [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1520.3600000000001s)]
*  It's a different thing man. And he's tall [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1525.96s)]
*  Don't respect the Holland. I think Ian Gares at a different level than those guys you mentioned [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1529.44s)]
*  I think so too and his movements different his size is different [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1533.88s)]
*  But he also used to fighting guys that are shorter than him. Yeah, and Michael Van and Paige is the first guy that's taller than [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1536.7600000000002s)]
*  He's taller than yeah, or the same height similar. Yeah, it's not like a huge advantage [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1543.0400000000002s)]
*  But also look at the age is a factor as well. That's true. That's true [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1547.5200000000002s)]
*  He's not even in he's just getting his prime dude when those guys are like 27 26 28 good fucking luck [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1551.1200000000001s)]
*  And they get so much better so quick. Yeah, the first thing we go [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1557.5200000000002s)]
*  It's kind of interesting that Ian Gary and Colby never came out because that like Ian was calling him [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1561.6399999999999s)]
*  I hope he said he's declining cuz he's not famous enough. That's so crazy and so incorrect [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1567.08s)]
*  Okay, so incorrect. Wait, wait, who was saying that Colby was saying he's not famous yet [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1572.36s)]
*  But meanwhile Colby's lost most of his last fights [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1576.9599999999998s)]
*  I think it's an interesting fight because Colby is a motherfucker man. Talk all the shit you want about that guy, but that guy [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1579.04s)]
*  Can fuck his gas tanks off the chart, you know [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1586.1999999999998s)]
*  What broke 30 seconds into the that fight with [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1589.36s)]
*  Leon Edwards, yeah, like he had a broken foot. It's broken in three places. He came to my show in Miami [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=1594.64s)]

*  Yeah, he struggled a little bit with Cody Brundage and Cody Brundage is nowhere near [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=2428.98s)]
*  Where Robert Robert Whitaker will change your fucking life? [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=2434.18s)]

*  He's certainly just a top holocaust certainly in the top [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=2453.84s)]
*  He's the man they're hyping him up well [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=2460.2200000000003s)]
*  He's an elite wrestler real top of the food chain blue chip wrestler and you know, he's getting very good at striking [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=2462.2s)]
*  He's basically our LeBron James, but he's white [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=2469.64s)]
*  He's his wrestling is super hard. That's a ridiculous thing to say. No the hype on him is insane [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=2472.48s)]
*  Hold on since so here we go [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=2481.24s)]
*  This is why you make the comparison guy like LeBron because he's in wrestling since he was seven. He was selling out fucking [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=2483.24s)]
*  Huge auditoriums wrestling dominating [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=2489.12s)]
*  The best ever at Penn State saying goes on a world circuit three time or four time NCAA champion [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=2494.0s)]

*  Anyone the heisman of NCAA? [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=2502.3199999999997s)]
*  What we're gonna say though Joe I was saying that like the difference is LeBron has been dominant and famous on a world championship [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=2505.68s)]
*  Level so long. It's more like a John Jones [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=2512.7999999999997s)]
*  John Jones is more like the LeBron of MMA [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=2515.52s)]
*  Prospect because there's so much pressure on him and he has how many fights? [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=2522.76s)]
*  Yeah, I would advise a guy like that to not fight in the UFC for a long time [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=2526.2400000000002s)]
*  I think you should get to world-class level before you get to the UFC [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=2530.2000000000003s)]
*  It's tough cuz cuz cuz outside the UFC. He's so dominant fucking so dominant [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=2533.34s)]
*  He's not even gonna strike him up. Yeah [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=2539.0s)]
*  Yes, cuz once you get there if you're not ready it's gonna be it's a it's a marathon not a [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=2541.32s)]
*  Boys, he'll fuck them up. He'll fuck them up in wrestling. He did already [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=2547.76s)]
*  He's beating a lot of Russians and wrestling his thing is very good [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=2551.36s)]
*  But even the whole up his striking is not like awful [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=2555.12s)]
*  His thing is combining the strike and wrestling put it together. That's right. He did well once he gets that [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=2559.4s)]
*  Yeah, okay [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=2565.04s)]
*  But Bo nickels a guy has been watching the human body move for a very long time me too and his timing [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=2565.74s)]
*  Timing takedowns is everything so so if they have an easier time a lot of times guys like that [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=2575.4199999999996s)]
*  Their learning curve is a lot steep. Well elite athletes have a quicker learning curve. Yes [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=2579.56s)]
*  Yeah, he's an elite athlete. No, no doubt about it [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=2584.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I mean Bo's got massive massive pretend potential, but even Johnny Hendrix remember his timing [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=2587.8999999999996s)]
*  He learned how to [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=2592.9s)]
*  So yeah, bro class Sada and post you saw to Johnny are two different human, correct, yeah, it's like you and Mike Tyson [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=2598.9s)]
*  It's like they're two totally different human different species post you saw them Johnny Hendrix like what where'd you go? [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=2605.14s)]
*  Like where'd you go? But also you wanna watch Johnny's fights and go man. That's world-class strike [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=2610.98s)]
*  He's just he had a big fucking overhand left. Take a time [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=2615.1s)]
*  Mendes power [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=2618.52s)]
*  Why get worse when they're not testing anymore? No, no, then once they start to okay [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=2620.8s)]
*  When they start testing his body melted like there's a lot of those guys like there's documentaries online about Johnny Hendrix pre and post you saw [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=2625.12s)]
*  He's like one of the biggest examples to be fair though. That was those were the time in those pictures [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=2632.0s)]
*  You don't see much. I mean you see a little bit of a difference in the physique [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=2637.16s)]
*  But what's really the difference is in the shocking power? [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=2640.22s)]
*  He would just put guys to fucking sleep power cardio the way fought confidence aggression [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=2643.22s)]
*  I thought to be fair to Johnny that those were the times everybody was on [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=2649.1s)]
*  Name somebody go ahead cuz those were my that was my era [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=2652.86s)]

*  Ceremony because he was sanctioned more than any of the leader by all the Western European countries in America [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3052.44s)]
*  And and he was given an award for being basically the biggest asshole. He threw himself the award. He was awarded [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3058.6600000000003s)]

*  Well, the problem with him was when he got covered he would not stop training until he had full-blown [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3078.52s)]
*  Covid and he was just beating his body into the ground every day. It's a shame [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3082.72s)]
*  Multiple times and I know it's a shame. He's a fucking bogeyman that might never come but when he fights [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3087.84s)]
*  It's fucking pretty goddamn exciting [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3092.84s)]
*  Although I did think tomorrow beat him in the third round. I was like if that was a five round fight [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3095.52s)]
*  That's a difficult fight for him. Yep, cuz you're dealing with a real champion knows how to pace himself guys been there [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3099.8s)]
*  Struggled before it knows what it feels like. So he really doesn't have a significant win at 85 [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3105.52s)]
*  Never be 85 or not a real good one. Joe Merrill shart, you know, he's beaten a couple of guys [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3109.92s)]
*  Not like that's not that short. No that tip of the spear. Excuse me. The oosmon thing was no [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3115.04s)]
*  He knocked and then you're gonna go to Robert Whitaker, right? [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3119.48s)]
*  But I think the fact big leap did he come in having two fights in two weeks or in the early days of his career [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3122.6400000000003s)]

*  Tricolis take one my favorite is taking a beating right now. Well, it's Shahra bullet does wild shit like hook kicks off that front leg [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3134.6s)]

*  Listen, look at that like the way he throws that front line foot his left leg is so interesting [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3154.2s)]

*  Good for him and you know, I showed way better takedown defense in this fight [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3214.48s)]
*  So obviously better training on that way better but obviously trickle ease again not an elite wrestler but fucking good fight [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3218.2799999999997s)]

*  You know why because the balls will always forever contain the sperm of the person who died [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3283.98s)]
*  So like if you died and you gave your dick to Brian Brian would have your kids Brian would be able to shoot you [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3289.3399999999997s)]

*  You know one of the things that they found is that? [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3371.02s)]
*  Neanderthal DNA in humans [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3373.72s)]
*  None of it is the Y chromosome [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3375.9199999999996s)]
*  They can't find Neanderthal DNA in Y chromosome. They find it in X chromosome. So it's all women being fucked by Neanderthals [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3378.3599999999997s)]
*  So yeah, yeah, it's so it's all it makes that human women being fucked by Neanderthal [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3386.3599999999997s)]

*  Yeah, do you know there's a theory that Neanderthals, you know [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3408.9599999999996s)]
*  We want to think that Neanderthals look like us that they're just different kind of like fucked up heads and big bones [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3412.8399999999997s)]
*  They were real thick. They were just like way heavier and denser [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3418.18s)]
*  But there's this crazy theory that they looked like gorillas and that we don't know what they looked like on the outside [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3421.4399999999996s)]

*  Because they had eyes that are much larger than our eyes they were smarter than them [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3430.92s)]
*  Yeah, but they led also those theories that they hunted us. There's some pretty cool documentaries [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3434.56s)]
*  What wouldn't they be more thinner? No, they were bigger. Yeah, they were short, but really heavy [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3439.32s)]
*  They were like five seven two hundred and ten pounds. So they're like freakishly strong like a chimp [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3446.12s)]
*  So they're built like you yeah, but freakishly strong like a chimp [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3452.12s)]
*  You know like not like a human like me I'm strong for a human [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3456.4s)]
*  They're strong like a chimp because massive bones massive tendons [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3460.28s)]
*  Everything's dense much bigger thicker heavier bone structure. Everything different that what makes chimps so strong there their tendon strength [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3465.2000000000003s)]
*  Everything makes them strong. First of all, how much plyometrics so those guys do god damn this throw in their body through the trees every day [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3472.36s)]
*  Throwing themselves around just know they're just neck and head [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3480.4s)]
*  Also heard they don't have any they don't have any medium twitch twitch muscle [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3486.0s)]
*  And they go from zero to a hundred when it comes to anger [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3495.2400000000002s)]
*  Or just rip your fucking arm. Yeah, that makes sense. That's all you need in the wild the wild you ain't running any marathons [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3499.36s)]

*  Which is just how it goes with this fucking sport man. It's been really rough this past month. I got I know [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3522.8799999999997s)]
*  Especially this car Jamal Hill versus Carlos Olberg. I was really looking for Jamal versus Khalil Khalil [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3529.08s)]
*  It's fucking scary for Jamal. I kind of like that. I don't I hate that Jamal hurt his knee [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3535.2799999999997s)]
*  But I kind of like that [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3541.08s)]
*  He's not jumping right back in after getting KO'd because I know everybody wants to do that because I got to get it back [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3542.56s)]
*  But the reality is he got fucking flat line by one of the scariest punchers on earth [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3547.3999999999996s)]
*  They're doing my favorite and I'm not saying he couldn't win the fight. I think for the longevity of square [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3552.3199999999997s)]
*  It's better that he got hurt Olberg's fucking scary, too. Yeah, and so is Khalil [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3556.62s)]

*  Then you find out Brady's pretty fucking good and that's how good ball all is. Yeah, but laws really fucking [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3733.3199999999997s)]

*  But D Rod started out as a boxer. I think yeah, he's fun [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3796.2s)]
*  This is a good fight as long as it doesn't go to the ground entertaining fight. Yeah, I [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3799.72s)]
*  Think it's gonna be a slugfest. It should be most likely [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3805.2400000000002s)]
*  Calvin is fucking dangerous on the heat man. His his combinations are so fluid [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3809.4s)]

*  Here's the Bisping one, I mean [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3845.3799999999997s)]

*  He had the window. I don't mean to be a hater [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3855.46s)]
*  I think he trades out of his camp, right? Yeah, yeah [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3862.22s)]
*  They're both drinking and eating together [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3866.02s)]
*  But that's real man, it's real I mean I wish that guy would show up [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3872.14s)]
*  Fuck yeah, you can crack me. It's so hard to maintain the fucking grind and that's what's up [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3877.5s)]
*  Yeah, I think after a while they don't love it anymore cuz it just breaks [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3886.06s)]
*  Well, and also the worst chart the worst part of fighting is is cutting weight [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3889.14s)]
*  Those last five pounds is the worst of the worst and you're getting older and enjoys food you're out for a while [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3893.3s)]
*  Cut out to get weight cutting out of that was me that was only me [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3900.1s)]
*  Nobody listened, but he I could fucking brought it up to them the moment they bought the UFC [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3905.22s)]
*  I pulled aria side and I said hey, this is what you should do [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3909.2599999999998s)]
*  You really want to do this blow up the weight classes cut out all the weight cutting make a big deal about it [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3912.74s)]
*  It's the most dangerous thing in the sport outside of getting kicked in the head [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3917.74s)]
*  It's the most dangerous thing in the sport and it's unnecessary getting kicked in the head as a part of sport [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3920.6s)]
*  There's no way you're gonna get around it [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3925.04s)]
*  But the most dangerous thing outside of that is weight cutting and we can eliminate that is it too late though. Yeah [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3926.2799999999997s)]
*  Oh, it's never happened. They don't listen to me. How would you do it though? [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3931.2799999999997s)]
*  I didn't no one listens to me. No, but you can't no one listens to me [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3934.0s)]
*  You need weight classes and then also Joe also wants there to be no cage and have it on an open friend Brian [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3937.44s)]
*  We went to karate combat it was just more entertaining to not have the cage in the cage it started as [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3951.2s)]
*  You don't have to have it what you need is a basketball court [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3958.0s)]
*  Went to see Gordon Ryan compete Thursday night, right you see everything it's [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3963.04s)]
*  There's still a map it's not a basketball court size Matt, right? [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3967.72s)]
*  But still controlled [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3971.24s)]
*  Bounds though, right? Yeah, they got to stay in balance. They move them back in the bounds, which is what it should be [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3974.24s)]
*  With a karate combat should had like like blood sport walls. Yeah [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3978.4s)]
*  Yeah, but [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3983.2400000000002s)]
*  Can't have ramps though, cuz then people would use the ramp. It's too easy to get taken down [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3985.2400000000002s)]
*  It's too easy to get taken down when you get pushed to the ramp [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3988.52s)]
*  But people use the cage but the cage stops you from getting taken down the ramp you fall, right? [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3990.64s)]
*  Okay, if someone's pushing you and you're near stairs, you're gonna fall down [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3995.12s)]
*  But you know what it did, you know what it cut out it cut out all the like all the running away [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=3998.64s)]
*  Yep, it for it forced the action. Yep. It does it does [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=4002.1600000000003s)]
*  I think a flat surface is the move by the large flat surface and then have danger zones where you can get a point deducted [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=4008.4s)]
*  If you enter into the danger zone too many times if there's like a warning track on the outside make the warning track big enough [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=4015.02s)]

*  He actually weighed 155 pounds, but damn he was so durable because he didn't cut the weight [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=4367.46s)]

*  He knows exactly how far your reaches look at that. I'm surprised Kelvin's not going for a takedown [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=4431.82s)]
*  Could be a cardio issue. Look at the way he's standing. He knows exactly he hardly ever does though [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=4436.46s)]
*  You know Kelvin a guy like D Rod you'd probably want to shoot it on but [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=4441.22s)]
*  He's having success on the face. Oh good combination left and right Kelvin [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=4445.0199999999995s)]

*  Nice nice faint up top and then left to the body [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=4503.38s)]
*  So I assume if Kelvin wins this fight he's gonna stay at 85, you know [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=4507.46s)]
*  Never gonna be those Drekas do pussy guys those massive 85ers [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=4515.9s)]

*  I love that he dropped Tyson Fury. I do not love the Joshua fight. That was sad watching him getting KO'd like that against Anthony Joshua [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5089.18s)]
*  I was like [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5096.62s)]
*  It's like you're just fighting one of the best boxers that's ever competed at heavyweight [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5097.900000000001s)]
*  It was a knockout puncher who really knows how to box was an Olympic gold medalist and you've had one box [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5102.34s)]
*  All right one that idea [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5106.9800000000005s)]
*  Usually one one against a hell of a fight one of the best [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5109.5s)]
*  But a guy who's been drinking and doing coke can barely pay attention and didn't take you serious [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5112.780000000001s)]
*  Didn't take you serious and you dropped him, but then he also might have he also might have had an incentive to keep that fight [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5116.98s)]
*  Going for a long time. I'm not saying anything, but what yeah, I said it who my Tyson Fury shut the fuck up [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5122.5s)]
*  He may have had it you're ridiculous. You're so wrong. You can you couldn't be oh yeah, Calvin [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5129.54s)]

*  Not a chance in hell you know and there's not a chance in hell that Tyson Fury carried him, huh? [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5137.58s)]
*  He was terrified of his house was dropped with a furious left hook in the left round [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5142.379999999999s)]
*  He got rocked in the eighth round no grow. It's the same thing that you see in the usik fight [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5147.46s)]
*  He's not all there anymore those fights with Deontay Wilder took something out of him [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5151.46s)]
*  100% Deontay Wilder in those days was the most terrifying knockout puncher in the history of the heavyweight division [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5157.66s)]
*  I believe he dropped him twice in that last fight and rocked him bad [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5164.0s)]
*  I feel like we don't appreciate Deontay Wilder as much as we should you know how it is man [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5168.7s)]
*  Once a guy loses you start thinking about him as the guy that just lost so wildly yeah, I don't I don't I don't either [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5175.54s)]

*  I don't think I think he's a bronze medal winner Tyson Fury fight. Did you not hear him talking? Yeah, but I'm just saying I'm finishing my thought [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5185.5s)]
*  Yeah, but you're finishing your thought while he's talking. That's kind of crazy [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5192.82s)]
*  Yeah, but you we were already having our conversation, and then you moved on [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5195.7s)]
*  I'm saying that the idea that Tyson Fury didn't have a bag of tricks, and he didn't carry him for me [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5199.42s)]
*  It's very strange to me. It's very strange. I don't know maybe he was maybe the train at all [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5205.46s)]
*  I look fat and look out of shape you know he was partying everybody said he was partying [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5209.74s)]
*  He's one of the greatest heavyweights of all time for sure [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5213.66s)]
*  But he's also fighting a mountain of a man with [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5216.54s)]
*  Insane physical abilities that caught him with a vicious left hook in the second round if he was carrying that dude [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5219.74s)]
*  All that shit would be out the window after you get dropped and rock like that. Oh [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5225.26s)]
*  Here it is boom [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5228.9800000000005s)]
*  It's a weird thing too because you want Francis to go on and make all the money [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5230.62s)]
*  But you self she wish he was still in the OC to fight John Jones, but even if I John Jones [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5236.14s)]
*  He he made ten times more money fighting Tyson and Anthony Joshua. Yeah close. He probably did he probably did [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5241.5s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know what do you know what he made? [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5249.18s)]
*  What did he make for the Tyson fury fight they announced it now I think with the paper he was like almost 20 Wow [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5251.34s)]
*  Yeah, and then Anthony Joshua probably another good amount. Yeah, yeah, I just think with boxing especially [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5257.8s)]
*  The thing is no one had seen Francis fight as a boxer and no one knew what to expect surprise everyone [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5265.66s)]
*  But then Anthony Joshua got to study his style and see the holes in his game [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5271.26s)]
*  And he exploited them like a fucking professional and that's what I said [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5274.9800000000005s)]
*  I said the the the shock factor is gone and and when he fights Anthony Joshua, this is how it should work [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5279.48s)]
*  You're gonna see how it really goes down. So the MMA guys are like man Francis do it. Maybe I'm jumping to boxing [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5285.719999999999s)]
*  Yes, and no because we fought Anthony. That's really how it should work. That's how the world should work, right? Unfortunately, right? [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5291.12s)]
*  Unfortunately, yes, but I'll tell you what if Francis had gotten into boxing when he got in the OC [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5297.719999999999s)]
*  He would be a heavyweight champion the world [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5302.36s)]
*  Artist can we can we give flak tank his flowers? Oh my god [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5305.44s)]
*  Javante Davis [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5308.88s)]
*  Well, hold on he's the he's the best knockout arts in boxing today, yeah easy [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5315.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah, he knocks on everybody. Yes, everybody sets up his power shots like like a fucking [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5320.0s)]
*  Technician and it's crazy did nothing special about the way he looks like [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5326.4800000000005s)]
*  Basically, no sign doesn't look like a power puncher. He just looks like a regular guy, but his fucking powers extraordinary [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5331.4800000000005s)]
*  And then that little that little bit of that little extra something he got from he got from being around Floyd for that little [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5338.719999999999s)]
*  Bit mmm that helped for sure man. He and bud crawford hate each other now, but he and bud Crawford [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5344.12s)]
*  Crawford's another one. It's just incredible. Well, I mean very very different style for sure [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5352.2s)]
*  But Javante is the most economical the thing is like he keeps you backing up and he wears you out without even using too much [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5356.36s)]
*  Energy and then as he gets you into the later rounds you're starting to slow down and he's just warmed up [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5363.4s)]
*  His boxing IQs wild wild [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5367.66s)]
*  Patterns out they just figure out what you're doing [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5371.66s)]
*  Oh, these collo all of these things are him like breaking down his opponent and then he and then they watch the fight that happened [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5374.0199999999995s)]
*  He was exactly he's a technician. Yeah when comes to boxing [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5379.8s)]
*  Yeah, but that's what makes the really good guys good is they can figure you out. What has been doing this is he was a child [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5382.22s)]
*  Calvin won this fight, right? Yeah, obviously [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5387.98s)]
*  Here's the decision. He had to tell you what I'm really excited. I love how the Saudi Arabian [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5390.94s)]
*  Government and the people the royal family's throwing the way they spend their money and they want to do Terrence Crawford Canelo Alvarez [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5396.3s)]
*  How dope is that guy went I like boxing and they go want these two guys fight like it's money goes [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5405.42s)]
*  Oh, I have money. Yeah. Okay. Hey, you have a lot of money [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5410.2s)]
*  Yeah, we print it with how much and they're giving it to the boys are getting paid [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5414.58s)]
*  Let me tell you something Saudi Arabia. They could come to the UFC and go we will buy you [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5419.74s)]
*  For two that's gonna happen dollars. Yeah, and then all sudden the UFC is Saudi Arabia. Yep. Yeah [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5424.1s)]
*  Well, that's what Dana was saying is Shannon about fighter pay. He was like, yeah, these guys these guys got so much money [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5429.5s)]
*  They don't care if they lose money. He's like I care if I lose money unless he's gambling well [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5434.82s)]
*  Yeah, and then like in the same conversation. He was like, yeah [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5438.7s)]
*  Here's the whole thing on fighter paying off see back in the day. I was super hard on it [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5442.1s)]
*  But my argument it has kind of changed to where cuz you're not a fighter no more [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5446.1s)]
*  No, but as a businessman you're on the outside looking in like you can argue all you want about fighter pay and how much they [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5450.9s)]
*  Should be paying [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5457.62s)]
*  What other leagues are around? [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5459.2s)]
*  You know I'm saying like you look at the longevity of the UFC look how massive the UFC is off their pace structure [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5461.2s)]
*  They're doing something fucking right. Oh, yeah as far as a business. They're doing something right all these other leagues [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5466.599999999999s)]
*  Listen, I watch PFL last night. I watch everything on degenerate [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5472.58s)]
*  There's nothing even remotely close to the UFC close thing is one championship because they'll do some jujitsu to do more Thai [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5475.34s)]
*  Yeah, and they have high-level guys the productions really good, dude [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5482.42s)]
*  It's UFC and then everybody else is so far behind man, and it was like oh, we got change fighter pay [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5486.16s)]
*  It's like we can we can that's affliction. You know so it's this it's this weird thing [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5491.74s)]
*  Let me ask that's a fighter. I'm like the PFL still doing that wacky point thing [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5496.54s)]
*  Yeah, I'm watching last night, and you know I'm balls deep in the final say [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5500.5s)]
*  I don't know what the fuck is going on. I don't know what the fuck is going on. It's too confusing [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5503.62s)]
*  No reason explain it. It's so weird [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5508.46s)]
*  They have a playoff system if it's also like if you win by knockout you get X amount of points if you win by [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5510.9s)]
*  Submission you get X amount of points and that affects your pay. I don't know so so the way they stand [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5516.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, so they then they put you in playoffs like seeds so that there's a regular season [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5521.22s)]
*  There's the playoffs so you have to have a certain amount of points to get to the playoffs and that depends on your seeding [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5525.78s)]
*  So win is three points it draws one point lost zero points round one stoppage three point round two stoppage two points round three [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5530.56s)]
*  Stoppage one bonus point that's stupid now describe that to a casual [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5536.84s)]
*  Yeah, example fighters win the first round TKO six points we get out of here with all that that's so dumb [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5540.280000000001s)]
*  I I hate it and a submission is one point none of it makes any sense, and they have no stars [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5546.400000000001s)]
*  It's fucking tough dude. It's stoppage submission counts [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5551.8s)]
*  You're fighting in a tournament [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5556.24s)]
*  Season they have a playoff in the whoever wins the playoff becomes a champion you get a million bucks listen to me PFL [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5559.0s)]
*  Abandoned shop a sand in shit stop no one likes it no one loves MMA more than us [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5565.639999999999s)]
*  And we hate it, but I fucking hate it and then also get rid of Bellator [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5570.8s)]
*  Just make it all under one banner. Yeah, we're doing trying all that shit. It's a good name [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5574.599999999999s)]
*  How do they decide the UFC rankings based on it's not voted on it's based on the experts are deciding [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5579.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5590.12s)]
*  Yes, same same way like the BC rankings BCS rankings there with the best [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5591.759999999999s)]
*  They're the best rankings we currently have available and most people agree on them. They're very close to what I would say are accurate [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5597.0s)]
*  Yeah, the only very rarely disagree with the ranking [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5603.86s)]
*  Yeah, the only time you disagree is like the pound for pound list which is stupid anyways [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5606.6s)]
*  So subjective so weird, but it's like John Jones or Islam. You know you could say Islam you could say John Jones [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5611.56s)]
*  I see both arguments and then the goat power for pound or the goat list I see GSP [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5618.48s)]
*  I see the argument for Mighty Mouse. So it's all about time John. Yeah, it's time here. I didn't know Rose was still fighting [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5624.5199999999995s)]
*  Yep. Yeah, yeah, I don't like the fact she's fighting at flyweight though, dude [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5630.0s)]
*  How about Paige Vans and is doing slap fighting? It's not real [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5634.56s)]
*  Bring it up. Jamie. Why? [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5638.080000000001s)]
*  Paige Vans that it's announced last fight. She had [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5640.200000000001s)]
*  She got dropped it was a draw in the rematch I think in November [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5646.6s)]
*  It's still real [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5651.84s)]
*  Like a street like a twitch real to me [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5654.84s)]
*  Situation is real [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5656.92s)]
*  Like Rose at flyweight, how come I think she's better at straw weight. I think it's straw weight at 115 [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5660.88s)]
*  She carries power, you know, she's she's big for the weight class that she knocked out, you know, you want to you and J check [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5665.64s)]
*  She's really legit at that weight. I think at 25 [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5671.4s)]
*  It's probably not as hard for her to cut the weight and that's why she wants to do it [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5675.14s)]
*  But I just don't see it man, right? I just think she's a flyweight, you know contender [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5678.32s)]
*  She's a strawweight champion, you know, and she's had incredible fights at straw weight. Oh, yeah [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5683.74s)]
*  This does nothing for me me either. There's a massive fan base for it. I can't figure on your boy Tony's balls [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5690.3s)]

*  Yeah, yeah, yeah [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5736.54s)]

*  I and there's no there's no talent to get slashing that fame [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5744.66s)]
*  I was chasing that fame to the end of the way I can't get I cannot understand it [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5749.0s)]
*  Well, or it's a business decision you say, okay [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5753.1s)]

*  People's faces and then she makes a deal where I get to slap first [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5760.66s)]
*  Can you do that? Can you say I'll fight you but I get to slap first [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=5765.3s)]

*  Yeah, and [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7166.92s)]
*  But that district attorney is the same lady that tried to try Trump but she's like fanny was [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7168.12s)]

*  So so they come in the court one day everyone's three hours late except him [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7186.0s)]
*  He's like what the fuck is going on and then he finds out that the judge had a what they call an ex parte [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7189.66s)]
*  Just seek like a meeting without him right part a meeting with the prosecutor the the district attorney [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7195.04s)]
*  Who's the prosecutor and the star witness? So the star witness was he got immunity to testify [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7202.28s)]
*  But the key witness to their whole case he gets on the stand and pleased the fifth [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7207.68s)]
*  So dates so they take him in the judge's chambers and him the sheriff the prosecutor and the judge [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7212.12s)]
*  Pressure this guy in a testifying because he basically tells him which is the legal the judge tells him [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7218.24s)]
*  Yeah, the judge tells him like I can hold you not tell just the end of this trial till all the trials are over [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7222.56s)]
*  Yeah, so you'll be you could be in jail for seven eight years without being charged with a crime [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7229.8s)]
*  And so then the dude was like, okay, I'll testify [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7234.0s)]
*  problem is [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7237.240000000001s)]
*  That that dude's lawyer went on vacation. He told him ahead of time. He was going on vacation [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7239.280000000001s)]
*  He couldn't cancel the tickets a year ago and he and he leaves this girl behind to take his place [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7244.320000000001s)]
*  The witness fires that girl [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7250.26s)]
*  Before they go into the meeting but they force her to sit in the meeting so he could say he had representation [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7253.02s)]
*  Right. So then boom so young attorney finds out about it. He's like he's like, hey judge [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7258.18s)]
*  It's highly unusual and illegal for you to have a meeting with a sworn-in witness and the prostitute prosecution and [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7263.14s)]
*  The judge goes how'd you find out about that? [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7271.18s)]
*  And so it turns into this it turns into this whole drama of like he's like, yo [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7274.5s)]
*  If you don't tell me how you found out I'm gonna hold you in contempt [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7278.38s)]
*  so he so he holds him in contempt and [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7281.54s)]
*  Then his attorney shows up and it's the same bitch that was trying to take down the prosecutor from the Trump thing [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7284.9800000000005s)]
*  And she's like I got 25 other lawyers with me [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7290.74s)]
*  We filing all these motions for this and motions for that they get him out [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7294.26s)]
*  They get him out of jail the next day. So he's so he's in jail with his client [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7298.26s)]
*  He's in jail with young thug they get him out of jail the next day the Supreme Court of Georgia was like no [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7301.42s)]
*  He's not in contempt until we have a hearing and then this and then this hearing like now all this other information is coming out [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7306.099999999999s)]
*  Because even if let's just say the meeting was legal, they supposed to have a transcript. They supposed to tell [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7311.38s)]
*  Them what happened and so it was shit called Brady evidence, which means [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7317.339999999999s)]
*  If the prosecutor finds out something that could that could exonerate your client [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7321.94s)]
*  They have to tell you right, right and in that meeting with the judge the dude the key witness told him [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7326.259999999999s)]
*  He was like I killed the guy [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7332.58s)]
*  And if I go on if I go on stand and say anything other than I'm gonna be perjuring myself and the prosecutor was like [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7335.1s)]
*  Well, I'm not gonna charge you with perjury if you perjure yourself. So basically like go lie [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7340.62s)]
*  Damn, but now it's illegal because I just found out something that could make young thug innocent [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7345.46s)]
*  I have to share it. So not only did they not tell the lawyer about the meeting not only did they not [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7351.14s)]
*  So the young thug was being originally charged with murder [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7356.3s)]
*  He's been in charge with murder [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7359.1s)]
*  He's been in charge where you go murder racketeering for running a criminal organization. Yeah, but this murder was the key murder [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7361.14s)]
*  Yeah, and so and so wow damn so now [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7368.14s)]

*  He felt like the fight was stopped too late and you know, it's dangerous when that kind of shit happens [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7572.8s)]
*  He was a commentator and he got upset at Herb who's the best referee alive [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7581.16s)]
*  There was that that started and then there's something with someone the UFC employee too. Yeah, I don't know what happened [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7587.6s)]
*  I don't know what's going on there. I don't know what happened, but I miss him [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7593.4800000000005s)]
*  I used to train with him a 10th planet. He's the best. He's a good dude one of the best minds in the game [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7595.92s)]
*  Shitty movie [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7602.92s)]
*  Entertaining dog you didn't like it. Oh you liked Roadhouse [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7606.08s)]
*  Fucking you know, yeah, but it was kind of like a comedy, right? I mean that's sort of tongue-in-cheek. It was so ridiculous [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7613.96s)]
*  I don't know. It's just an action movie. You know what? I didn't see it. But listen, they filmed it at the UFC [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7620.02s)]
*  Oh, really? Yeah, they filmed scenes [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7625.64s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I'm walking out I was like I'm not involved in this so stupid I got out [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7627.64s)]
*  But I wanted me to interview him. I'm not a fan of so bad. It's good. Yeah [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7632.52s)]
*  No, I'm a fan of how many people why I think what the opening week was like 50 million [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7636.64s)]
*  I'm a fan of when a fighter ventures out into something they do [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7642.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I'm a fan of that and I don't get why people hate on it like Conor McGregor could do anything [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7645.320000000001s)]
*  Whenever a fighter does anything like doesn't pour a sauce best hot sauce. I know I didn't I didn't hate on it [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7649.280000000001s)]
*  I didn't hate on when I heard about it. I hate on it after I watched it. That's fair. It wasn't good [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7654.96s)]
*  Both guys are heavyweights. And he was that look at that. That's a former heavyweight champion [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7660.2s)]
*  Look at that Volkov standing next to former heavyweight champ. So crazy. That's how good DC was [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7664.76s)]
*  Yeah, that's how good DC with DC should have been 185 pounder. Correct. Maybe even one correct. No, just kidding 180 though [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7669.34s)]
*  One eighty five. Yeah, I hate it when people do that what he shook his hand as he was walking away. He did this [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7676.32s)]
*  Yeah disrespectful [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7682.8s)]
*  For didn't make me feel it some kind of way. I'm with all they just they just I'm not there in a hurry [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7686.360000000001s)]
*  They're happy and they got somebody in there here. Here we go [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7690.6s)]
*  Robert the Reaper Bobby knuckles in the fucking house, dude, can you imagine his bonic again ready right now? [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7693.240000000001s)]
*  Oh, man, I would love it and hams lot if it was ha ha right now. Yeah. Hey bro, these new gloves [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7698.68s)]
*  They know better than the old gloves. No, the only cool thing about is still getting poked in the eye [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7704.04s)]
*  So what do they do? What they change made a better glove? It is better [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7708.56s)]
*  I should say it's better padding the best gloves the best gloves are [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7711.28s)]
*  Clearly not made yet. They need to cover the fingers, you know, they just they need to cover the fingers [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7716.719999999999s)]
*  There's no reason for the you don't ever do this ever the fingers never come into play [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7722.32s)]
*  There's not a time where your fingers you you always do this [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7726.88s)]
*  Whether it's grappling or striking all you have to do is have [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7731.28s)]
*  padding on the knuckles and a [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7735.76s)]
*  Protective layer a thin leather layer that covers the hands that the fingers slip into what about then you cut out? [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7737.96s)]
*  It's the same. It's exactly the same. The only thing different. The only thing different is you now [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7746.16s)]
*  You can get jab with the thumbs [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7752.56s)]
*  So only thumb pokes will still exist and we'll have less pokes because a lot of our eyes [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7754.280000000001s)]
*  It eliminates probably 90% of all eye pokes and it doesn't change anything with grappling anything was striking [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7760.04s)]
*  You have it like an everlasting bad glove [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7766.32s)]
*  But no padding and so with a finger area completely unpadded and just a thin [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7768.92s)]
*  Leather cover that covers over that and goes to the fingers right? [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7774.04s)]
*  You not only that you'd be able to do it better because leather especially if it's not if it's raw leather [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7779.759999999999s)]
*  If it's not shiny if it's raw leather that in that dope [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7784.639999999999s)]
*  Shane against the machine you made that with thimbles Shane against the machine. Yeah, he did he's got we have another one of his pieces [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7789.96s)]
*  I have one at home [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7796.24s)]
*  Another skull that he made for me and then another one we have which is a World War two helmet with a bayonet in it [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7797.68s)]
*  That's a lamp, but it's in our storage, but I love that one [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7804.48s)]
*  But yeah, man cover the fucking fingers. There's no reason to have these fingers open like this [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7809.04s)]
*  This is so unnecessary if you just had a covering over the fingertips. That's a thin piece of leather you would [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7813.32s)]
*  Eliminate all those fingers going in the eye so your fingers would go still you still get poked a little bit [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7821.42s)]
*  But it wouldn't be this size back [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7826.679999999999s)]
*  Would have it like webbed like bad gloves those old black exactly like I said [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7829.34s)]
*  Yeah [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7833.58s)]
*  Just cover it with one thin piece of layer of leather and it would make gripping better [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7833.74s)]
*  What is the argument against no argument against it again? Nobody listens to the argument nobody listens to me [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7839.74s)]
*  That's good. You told him to do on open field so they just shut you out, but I told him to do a football field [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7844.78s)]
*  Which is insane have those guys the middle [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7849.04s)]
*  I'm doing I'm right. I'm right nobody listen [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7852.8s)]
*  Here's I have a bunch of rules that I would implement if I was the king here's number one key number one no stand-ups [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7857.4s)]
*  Ever no stand-ups. I don't give a fuck get out [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7863.76s)]
*  I can't get out figure out how to get up [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7866.44s)]
*  Also, if a guy takes you down at the end of the first round the second round starts with you in that exact same [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7867.64s)]
*  100% you can never get up unless you get up. So you hate because it's not it's not once. Yep [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7873.64s)]
*  I hate you [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7878.2s)]
*  Sounds so it's not five fights. It's not five five minute fights. It's one fight [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7880.599999999999s)]
*  So if a guy takes you down, that's where you are at the beginning of the next round [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7885.96s)]
*  You get the one minute break though. You just start in that yeah [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7890.32s)]
*  If you know you start I also like the idea that the the judges only see the last round [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7892.8s)]
*  I think there should be six judges not three six judges and then I also think that you should have [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7897.84s)]
*  for sure you [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7904.16s)]
*  Have no weight cutting weight cutting should be completely eliminated for sure that was should be the first one before they implement any of these [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7906.24s)]
*  Rule changes cut all this legalized cheating shit. Kamaru Usman is not 170 pounds [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7912.44s)]
*  He's never been 170 pounds for more than five minutes five seconds [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7918.2s)]
*  He loses the weight and then immediately rehydrates you stand next to him. The guy's massive balloons up [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7921.8s)]
*  He's so big why even number of judges beginning more judges threes not enough and I don't think they should be ringside [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7927.04s)]
*  I think should be a remote location where they're not influenced by the crowd [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7933.32s)]
*  I think they should be able to watch the fight and hear the commentators. Maybe not the commentators [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7936.44s)]
*  I don't think it should be next to the ring [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7941.08s)]
*  I think they should have a separate [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7942.5599999999995s)]
*  But I don't think next to the ring is bad because then you get to hear what's going on like maybe something's happening [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7943.799999999999s)]
*  Let them listen to the commentators. Maybe have one next to the ring. I don't know but that that's debatable [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7948.719999999999s)]
*  There's but more judges more judges more judges so that if you have one cock-eyed asshole who? [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7953.719999999999s)]
*  Fucks everything because there's so many cock-eyed fighter [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7959.599999999999s)]
*  Like decisions like the way you look at it you go how the fuck you know [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7963.36s)]
*  How many times me and DC have looked at each other and go what the fuck was that one card like it's Michael Bisping judging [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7966.8s)]
*  What he's got one good eye he would get it right? [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7971.639999999999s)]
*  It's like you see a guy get [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7974.92s)]
*  Three four fights wrong in a night and you hear his name again. You go what the fuck man [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7977.36s)]
*  Yeah, that's wild [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7981.92s)]
*  But that guy would first of all they should be cut out as soon as they have one of those [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7982.5599999999995s)]
*  Get rid of them throw them away at least suspended yeah, I get rid of them if you ever do that you you don't know what [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7986.919999999999s)]
*  You're doing these she shouldn't be doing it, but back to the I pokes [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7992.5599999999995s)]
*  I think sure change change the gloves hopefully that happens [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7995.44s)]
*  But if not I think an eye poke or a serious like groin strike one automatic point one point it would stop it [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=7998.919999999999s)]
*  Yes, John's gonna like I can't lose a fucking point so you're not gonna be reaching out like this exactly because now it's just a warning [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=8005.219999999999s)]
*  One three one one point I poke one point nut shot automatically [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=8011.52s)]
*  Friends crap one point yes, one grab a fence stop a takedown one point that's easy to do tomorrow tomorrow [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=8016.68s)]
*  I don't get it so cut that out cut weight cutting out you you fix 90% of the problems [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=8022.320000000001s)]
*  Have to agree to the rules yeah, everybody has to agree the rules, but the rules are good [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=8028.6s)]
*  These are good sense if I could argue this in front of these people [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=8032.72s)]
*  I really think I can make a good point those people aren't all the same people that like wasn't what haven't been a few [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=8035.780000000001s)]
*  Fights that should have been overturned and they never did yeah, they never overturned [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=8041.04s)]
*  I don't think I don't use them Vince those people with logic [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=8044.68s)]
*  Well, I'm aren't fighters right a lot of the people that make those decisions have are not actual fighters [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=8047.08s)]
*  They don't know [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=8052.12s)]
*  A lot of the judges have not even stepped on the mat they never even taken a jujitsu [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=8054.12s)]
*  And if you know jujitsu if you don't know like how close something is like you don't know you really don't know you [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=8060.68s)]
*  Sometimes a triangle looks good, but it's bullshit sloppy [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=8068.34s)]
*  Yeah, there's no chance and if someone just sees like like an instep over an ankle like oh my god [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=8072.219999999999s)]
*  He's got the triangle. He doesn't have a fucking triangle like this [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=8078.5199999999995s)]
*  There's so many times where something looks good, but if you're you have a skilled eye [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=8080.54s)]
*  You don't know what the fuck is going on. That's so [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=8084.639999999999s)]

*  He comes back fucking guns blazing every time lost the Izzy fight came back in the rematch almost won [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=8116.48s)]
*  Very close fight in the second fight Robert Whitaker is a bad man, and now he's coming off that polo costume when he looked great [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=8122.82s)]
*  God, I wanted hams on him so bad [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=8129.099999999999s)]

*  They're like, oh Strickland's a born fireman. Can you never watched him fight? I don't find it boring [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=8169.7s)]

*  I don't get it constantly moving forward. It's just casuals. I think Strickland's one of the most exciting fighters in the sport [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=8178.9s)]
*  I love what I just couldn't I couldn't believe that at one point Costa didn't at least just [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=8184.339999999999s)]

*  Polo-crosses number one thing is cardio. There's nothing more exhausting than shooting shots [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=8202.94s)]
*  And you're not gonna do it against Strickland at that level and it's not in his background [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=8207.1s)]

*  You know, he got through that fight where Joe Pfeiffer is one of the most fucking terrifying guys on the feet [[02:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=9475.54s)]
*  He's so scary. So fast. He hits so fucking hard. He beat Francis and gonna was punch count [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=9480.18s)]
*  He's a fucking 185 guy so powerful crazy power just preposterous power on the feet [[02:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=9486.580000000002s)]
*  It just he burnt himself out. Well, you know, Jack Cramanson is seasoned [[02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=9492.5s)]
*  He's a real real veteran real veteran and knew what to do [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=9496.740000000002s)]
*  Good enough on the feet to kind of drag him into the third fourth and fifth rounds [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=9500.18s)]
*  Wear him out and then at the end of the fight, you know, he was just the fresher fight [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=9504.460000000001s)]
*  But a fight like that where he's on his crew. Perfect [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=9507.980000000001s)]
*  Yeah, he learned cuz you don't want to learn that when you're fighting the top five [[02:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=9511.080000000002s)]
*  Now we'll forget about it who gives a fuck but Joe Pfeiffer has everything to be a world champion everything [[02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=9515.22s)]

*  I think your career didn't get KO didn't get beat up [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=9527.74s)]
*  Just lost the light lesson and lost the fight at a fight where he's dominating in the beginning with terrifying shots [[02:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=9530.38s)]
*  But you can't take everybody out with big power. Sometimes you got to set things up [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=9536.1s)]
*  You got to pick your shots, especially veterans before they don't panic exactly [[02:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=9540.3s)]
*  And you got to keep that power into the third fourth and fifth round [[02:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=9544.54s)]
*  So if you've emptied the gas tank in the first two rounds try to take a guy out and he's still there [[02:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=9547.460000000001s)]
*  Fuck that was the best thing to happen to him. Yeah, very good thing [[02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=9551.820000000002s)]

*  We're like, I don't know. He might not make it. I make it so hard to do like what Connors come up Mike [[02:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=9592.7s)]
*  It's such a special time. Mm-hmm. Oh and the hype was there. He's calling it. You're like what the fuck [[02:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=9597.98s)]

*  I think I've never been more excited about weight classes and never been more excited about matchups [[02:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=9612.0s)]
*  You know, there's so many good fights [[02:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=9617.58s)]
*  Yeah, you know Leon Edwards versus Bala Muhammad is not getting the respect that it deserves for whatever fucking stupid reason people don't like Bala [[02:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=9619.26s)]
*  Muhammad I don't get it at all. I think he's awesome. He's a great guy. He's a cool great guy [[02:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=9626.66s)]
*  He's a really great guy and people don't want to see him fight. It's just weird [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=9631.619999999999s)]
*  Thank God the UFC didn't bend the knee to the fans, you know complaining those fans are ridiculous [[02:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=9635.9s)]
*  I got a prediction on this and he disagrees with me. I think because he's Palestinian [[02:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=9640.539999999999s)]
*  You're gonna see the entire world come out for this fight. Oh, they definitely will. I don't think that's controversial at all [[02:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scA5R14ojCg&t=9644.58s)]
