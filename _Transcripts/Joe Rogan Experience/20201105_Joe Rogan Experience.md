# Joe Rogan Experience #1559 - Steven Rinella
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [November 05, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=surnFz_pZE4)
*  Joe Rogan Podcast, checking in.
*  The Joe Rogan Experience.
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan Podcast by night, all day.
*  You were just telling me about your friend, that was a dick collection?
*  I wish he was my friend still.
*  It was, when I was younger, I don't know how I came into his orbit, but there was a fur
*  buyer and taxidermist and muskrat trapper in Muskegon County, where I grew up in Michigan
*  and he had a massed and very impressive collection of baculums.
*  And you brought this up because Frank Von Hipple had given us this fossilized walrus,
*  ancient walrus dick bone.
*  Pecker bone, swizzle stick.
*  Yeah, a friend of mine, Clay Newcomb, he uses them for very, he saves the black bear ones
*  and people use them as drink stirrers and stuff.
*  The first deer I ever killed, you gave me one and I was using it as a coffee stirrer
*  for a while.
*  Oh, like an ant?
*  No, it's not like an actual bone bone in there.
*  Isn't there a bone bone in there?
*  No.
*  Well, you gave me one.
*  You might not have given me one from that.
*  You gave me one from something else.
*  Maybe a raccoon or a bear or something.
*  I have to look at it.
*  I don't know, but you gave me a dick bone and I had it in my backpack for a long time.
*  Oh, huh.
*  Yeah, so.
*  How often do you give away dick bones?
*  You don't even remember that.
*  I wish I had more to share.
*  This guy, this Bob Ferris guy, we used to laugh because he looked like Bob Ferris, looked
*  exactly like Bob Dylan.
*  And he's got to be around still.
*  I remember being over his house one day and him advising someone over the phone with an
*  ear shot of me.
*  I remember this guy was going out to set muskrat traps.
*  And I remember Bob Ferris advising him, if anybody fucks with you, shoot them.
*  And I was young enough that I didn't get that that was a humor thing.
*  You know, whatever, just like a thing you'd say to your buddy to have a laugh.
*  And I remember being like, man, these guys are serious about muskrats.
*  I was like, I hope I don't run into that dude in the marsh.
*  Now I'm like, I could totally see saying that to somebody and then we'd have a laugh and
*  get off the phone.
*  How many animals have that bone?
*  Man, I wish I knew.
*  And I don't even know what.
*  It's not universal.
*  No, no, it'd be interesting to look up.
*  Until right now, I never gave it any thought to what classification of things has an actual
*  baculum, an actual pecker bone.
*  You know, all the weasels have it.
*  I think chimps have it.
*  We don't.
*  Yeah.
*  Weasels do.
*  Here it goes.
*  It's absent human ungulates, elephants.
*  What is that?
*  Monotrems?
*  Monotremes?
*  What is that word?
*  Monotremes?
*  Oh, the platypus and the echidna.
*  Parsupials, lagomorphs, hyenas, bino-tarongs, sirenians, and cetaceans, among others.
*  Evidence suggests that the baculum was independently evolved nine times and lost in ten separate
*  lineages.
*  God, it just keeps coming up, man.
*  It just keeps coming up.
*  The need to have one of those.
*  The need to, yeah, a built-in hardon.
*  That's a really nice one.
*  I like that one.
*  There are some that are big enough.
*  I don't know what they're off.
*  There are some that are big enough to be used as a cane.
*  Really?
*  Yeah.
*  What animal is that?
*  I thought it was like certain walrus ones.
*  People used to use them as canes.
*  Well, that's not small, that one right there.
*  And it's interesting because of the fact that it's fossilized.
*  It's so heavy.
*  Can you imagine carrying that between your legs?
*  I wish I had a, I feel like I want to challenge you on, I feel like I want to challenge you
*  on that being fossilized.
*  Well, he said it was fossilized.
*  You don't think it is?
*  You think by the appearance because it's so light?
*  But doesn't it feel heavy as shit?
*  Yeah, I don't want to get in over my weighters here, but I want to challenge that.
*  But I would need to scrape into it with a pocket knife and not want to do that to your
*  baculum.
*  That's okay.
*  You could do that.
*  Here.
*  But see, even, don't do it because who am I to tell?
*  I mean, you might scrape into it and I don't.
*  Would they curve that?
*  But goddamn, dude, this is so heavy.
*  No, there are, there are that.
*  I don't know.
*  They might, but there are some that have a hook in them.
*  It keeps, it keeps your mate from getting away.
*  Jamie, that'd be a hell of a pimp stick.
*  You walking around with one of those?
*  Lil Pimp should have one of those.
*  Lil Pimp.
*  Did you hear that?
*  The thing with Trump, he called Lil Pump.
*  There's a rapper named Lil Pump and he called him Lil Pimp.
*  No, I didn't.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, he did it.
*  He did it the other day at a rally and everybody was upset.
*  Tim's new character I was going for.
*  Yeah.
*  This has got to be fossilized, man.
*  How else could it be that heavy?
*  What kind of bone would be that heavy, Steve?
*  That's so heavy.
*  Here, come on, man.
*  You want me to put a little?
*  Yeah, get in there.
*  You know what?
*  I'm going to give a little scraper down here on the end.
*  Scrape it.
*  Tell me what's up.
*  God, that buzz.
*  It is.
*  It's fossilized.
*  Well, now I want to say that just like we were talking a minute ago about how better
*  or betters are betting like it's Trump, it's Biden.
*  I'm like back to it's fossilized.
*  But it's so heavy.
*  I'm a flim flopper.
*  My convictions are weakly held.
*  But no, poking it with your knife makes me think that it's a, poking it with your knife,
*  but this is way outside of my area of expertise.
*  Poking with your knife makes me a believer.
*  I think Von Hippel is a biologist, right?
*  He's a man.
*  You got a really good fact checker over here.
*  It's like having, it's like having Doug Dern around.
*  Yeah, it is very similar.
*  Doug's a very good fact checker.
*  It's all he does.
*  He doesn't, he doesn't, he only like when you're talking to him, he just looks at his
*  phone because he's like, no matter what you say, it's like, uh, uh, uh, uh, yeah, yeah,
*  yeah, yeah.
*  He reads biology, ecology.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah.
*  So there you go.
*  There's another one that's a physicist.
*  Uh, when it comes to, the reason I have become interested in things being fossilized is,
*  uh, you know, if you're out on national forest land, not, notice I'm not saying national
*  parks, but if you're out on national forest land or BLM land, various land designations,
*  uh, you know, if you find like an antler or deer antler, you can keep it right.
*  Or if you find a chunk of bone, you can keep it.
*  Um, but not a, not an arrowhead, right?
*  No, no, cause that's an artifact.
*  What do you say?
*  That's weird.
*  You're supposed to leave it there.
*  Dude, does anybody, that's an interesting, I'd like talk about because no, they do.
*  I remember.
*  So let me, let me finish my thing about fossilized real quick.
*  Just cause it'll, uh, the reason I started to think about it is if, but you're allowed
*  to pick up a bone.
*  Okay.
*  If you're just out on, depends on land designation.
*  Let's say you're on a national forest and you find a piece of bone, you can keep it.
*  If it's fossilized, you can't keep it.
*  Okay.
*  So you could find a, like, I found a few buffalo skulls that are old, but still bone.
*  So here you have this thing that could be like 300 years old, eroding out of a riverbed.
*  And if it's not fossilized, you can have it and keep it.
*  Um, if it's just bone, the thing is if that thing has cultural markings on it, then it
*  becomes an artifact.
*  So say you found a, a friend of mine, I don't know where they might've got it off.
*  I don't know where they got it.
*  They had had like the grandfather found it.
*  They had a buffalo skull that had been axed open and it was so clearly hit open with a
*  tool to get the brain out, which would make it an artifact and then you can't touch it.
*  Or if it's fossilized, you can't touch it.
*  The private land is totally different, but, um, yeah, it would be that, uh, so now when
*  I like look at stuff, I'm always picking it up.
*  I'm always like wishing I had a better sense because I don't want to grab, I don't want
*  to like find something to bring home and then be in violation because I brought home a fossilized
*  thing.
*  Are you under any obligation to report it?
*  Like say if you found a skull that had obviously been opened up by like, uh, ancient
*  native Americans, are you under any obligation if you can't take it to like point archaeologists,
*  like, you know, drop a pen, point archaeologists to the spot where you found it?
*  I don't, I can't imagine.
*  No, I, I want to, I'm virtually certainly not under any obligation.
*  I did one time find a bison skull on national forest land and did a site report where I
*  cooperated with the forest, the administrative unit of that national forest because I had
*  gone and did some work on it and had a radiocarbon date.
*  So I was able to supply them with a piece of information they didn't have.
*  And so we cooperated and did a site report.
*  And I had also kind of like called a little bit to make sure I wasn't in the wrong.
*  And this is in your book, which is really good.
*  I listened to the audio version.
*  So nice to hear your voice that you, you got a chance to do it because I know the first
*  version of it, they hired some actor to do it.
*  Yeah, it was, it was, it's kind of a funny thing about the book businesses, you know,
*  audio as you know, cause you've kind of like in some ways helped be at the vanguard of
*  pioneering this, but, um, audio was more and more important.
*  It's more and more valuable now.
*  When I sold that, my first couple of books, um, a publisher would, you know, buy your
*  book and they would buy, they buy just kind of like all rights to it.
*  Right.
*  And they would then go sell the audio off for sometimes next to nothing.
*  And someone would buy the audio rights for a certain specified amount of time.
*  So my first couple of books, um, my publisher buys my book and then my publisher basically
*  turns around, um, publisher then in this case, random house turned around and sold the audio
*  rights to, I think, brilliance audio, whatever it is.
*  And they got it for 10 years.
*  And at first I thought that they didn't invite me to read it because I didn't think I was
*  like up to it.
*  Right.
*  Uh, but I just wasn't invited to read my own book.
*  They hired a soap opera actor of some sort to read it.
*  I now think it's just an efficiency thing.
*  Like they have sort of a stable, this company was based in Michigan, my home state, just
*  totally coincidentally, but happened to be based there.
*  They have like a stable of talent that comes in and they're clean.
*  They do clean work.
*  They do fast work.
*  Um, and they produce an audio book, like working with an author.
*  It might take four or five days to record an audio book, but they can just get a guy
*  that comes in, nails it, hammers it, whatever.
*  I get the, I get the product and I turn it on and he starts talking and I couldn't get
*  across the room fast enough to turn it off.
*  It was the mo it was like, it was like watching, uh, it was like watching my wife have sex
*  with another man.
*  Whoa.
*  Is like to see, to hear.
*  I'm like, that is not what that book sounds like, you know?
*  Right.
*  And, oh my God, was a defensive and then 10 years goes by.
*  Cause I wrote that book a decade ago, 10 years goes by.
*  Um, and we get the rights back.
*  So then not random house has them back and I got to go in and record my own thing and
*  I got to update some of the science and stuff.
*  You know, it was, it was kind of like one of those little, it was one of those career,
*  uh, like a little career highlight for me.
*  Like, like something looking from the outside, I didn't, wouldn't see, um, wouldn't like
*  see it as anything.
*  But to me it was like, it was richly symbolic that, that I had whatever got to like be in
*  a position to be like, I want to do it.
*  I go in and record my book.
*  It's how it wants to be.
*  And that something could still kind of have life after a decade.
*  Yeah.
*  My friend, God Saad, who is a, uh, he's a professor out of Montreal.
*  He wrote a book, he's an evolutionary biologist and he wrote a book on, uh, called the parasitic
*  mind about just very bizarre behaviors and the way people are, uh, the weird thought
*  are falling into today.
*  Woke culture and all that kind of shit.
*  And they hired some-
*  Can you give me another example?
*  Another example of-
*  Of a thought virus.
*  Well, thought virus is probably not even, I mean, he's used that term before, but it's
*  basically woke thinking.
*  Like, uh, what's problematic about it.
*  Now it's not, not very objective and not rational and that people are expected to think and
*  way because the gatekeepers of social media and all these people are the ones that are
*  forcing this on folks.
*  Anyway, uh, he's got a very popular podcast and yet they still hired somebody else to
*  read his book.
*  And I was like, this is so crazy.
*  Like you have such a distinct voice.
*  Like why would you-
*  Yeah.
*  What, what the fuck are they doing?
*  Like why would they do that?
*  I think that it leads to, it leads to a lot of listener disappointment.
*  Yes.
*  The first time I did this, though, I wasn't, I was just a writer.
*  Right.
*  So there wasn't that.
*  And maybe we're moving away from that.
*  Um, when you're working on something and I'm sure, oh no, you'll know intimately well
*  what I'm talking about.
*  Uh, imagine you're, um, imagine your standup.
*  If you had to like turn in a word doc, I've had to do that before for someone else to
*  do your standup.
*  I had to do that before.
*  Oh, oh, not for someone else to do it.
*  But for, for them to decide whether or not the things that I was saying were approvable.
*  Oh, I got you.
*  I went up and without, without the, without all the delivery, I mean, like I don't want
*  to, I'm not trying to conflate that, like writing a book and stand up cause delivery
*  is vastly more important than what you do, but you, you do get a sense of like the cadence
*  of how something goes.
*  Yeah.
*  And it feels important to you, but it's kind of like a goofy way to think about it.
*  Cause people that everyone that read it, everyone that reads it is on their own trip.
*  They don't know your cadence, but somehow it's just offensive to hear them read it aloud.
*  Yeah.
*  Well, I don't know if this makes any sense.
*  This is like peculiar.
*  This is like particular to virtually nobody.
*  No, I think it makes a lot of sense.
*  I mean, particularly now, particularly now because your podcast becomes so popular and
*  people are used to the way you talk.
*  You have a very unique way of describing and discussing things.
*  And I could imagine how offensive it would be if someone just sort of actored it.
*  Yeah, it is.
*  And that was, so like that book, I was at the height of my writing powers because I
*  hadn't had, I was just a writer.
*  I wasn't married.
*  I didn't have kids.
*  You were free.
*  I could spend a couple of years just like focused on something.
*  And so I do, the fact that that thing still, the fact that that book still works and people
*  still read it, I'm happy about that.
*  Because I look and be like, yeah, man, I feel like that was a reasonable book.
*  That's an interesting way.
*  It's a very good book.
*  I really enjoyed it.
*  But it's an interesting way of talking about it, that you were at the height of your writing
*  powers because you were free, because you really could just concentrate on that.
*  And I think about that a lot with anything.
*  That's the case with stand-up comedians.
*  It's the case with fighters for sure.
*  When fighters have families and then they start getting distracted by a bunch of other
*  businesses and other things that they're doing, it's almost always signifies a downslide
*  in their skills.
*  Yeah.
*  Almost always.
*  For sure, man.
*  I'm watching right now on Netflix, I'm watching The Last Dance, the Jordan documentary.
*  I'm not a basketball fan at all.
*  Most of this stuff's new information to me.
*  But I'm watching it and that study of focus and discipline.
*  And I wonder, in looking at him, I couldn't help but think, let's say there was an undecided
*  election.
*  It was a contested undecided election and there's a global pandemic.
*  That guy would still go on that field or on the court, sorry, and probably be just as
*  good as he always is.
*  And I think that a decade ago, whatever, at that point in life when you're just like,
*  maybe more self-absorbed or something, I could be sitting right now in this current climate,
*  I'll be sitting right now just singularly focused on this thing instead of the school
*  board is voting, whether or not kids are going back to school full time.
*  And I need to pay attention to that because I have kids, I need to pay attention, I feel
*  obligated to pay attention politically and I have other mediums that I work in now.
*  And yeah, you just get spread out doing stuff.
*  I feel like maybe that doesn't happen to you.
*  No, it does.
*  Yeah, it does.
*  I remember you telling me you have three jobs.
*  Yeah, I do.
*  Do you jump from one to the other?
*  They connect, fortunately.
*  They help each other.
*  The thing about, well, obviously I haven't been doing much standup during the pandemic.
*  I only did one weekend.
*  I did one weekend in Houston and then I got real weirded out thinking like, what if I
*  caught COVID and then I gave it to somebody, particularly if I gave it to a guest.
*  But standup comedy for sure helps podcasting.
*  Podcasting for sure helps standup comedy.
*  You get more comfortable doing each one of them because the fact that standup comedy
*  is live and then podcasting is also live.
*  There's no net, there's no script and you get more comfortable expressing yourself.
*  In standup comedy, the fear of doing it in front of live audiences, you get accustomed
*  to people paying attention to you and watching you.
*  That makes UFC commentary easier because when the cameras are on the UFC, I never think,
*  oh shit, all these people are watching now.
*  I never think that because people are always watching.
*  I don't care.
*  I can just express myself.
*  So they feed into each other.
*  What do you, because you get increasingly, at least from my perspective, increasingly
*  you get scrutinized and over scrutinized in the media.
*  Is it hard to tune it out?
*  It's easier than ever.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, it's interesting.
*  Because it's so common, I could just shut it off.
*  Yeah, no, it's just, it's one of the things that happens.
*  You get too big.
*  If you get too big, you get too popular.
*  Look, if there's 300 million people in this country and you have, 1% of them are critics,
*  you get a million critics.
*  You know?
*  Yeah, and you're being conservative with that number.
*  If you're really lucky, you only have a million critics.
*  You really have three million critics.
*  Three million critics, that's a crazy number.
*  That's such a nutty number.
*  If there's 300 million people and 1% of them don't like you, you have three million people
*  that don't like you?
*  Yeah.
*  That's insane.
*  If you really stop and thought about that, that'll fuck with your head.
*  If you have people in the media, if you have 100,000 professional journalists that are
*  focused on comedy, what are the numbers that are not going to enjoy you?
*  It's going to be high.
*  It's going to be a few thousand.
*  When I'm reading about you and what you think and how you are, and I'm sitting there thinking,
*  like, nobody's not.
*  It makes me question everything I read.
*  I was saying to someone the other day that there's one thing Americans like, there's
*  like two stories Americans like in this order.
*  They like a story about what an asshole a celebrity is.
*  The second thing they like most, but not as much as that thing, is how great a celebrity
*  is.
*  They like the first one better.
*  Yeah, it's way better.
*  It's more sellable, right?
*  That's why this Ellen is mean thing has gotten so much traction.
*  Ellen's mean to her guests and she's mean to you.
*  People are like, ooh, tell me more.
*  Exactly.
*  It's exciting.
*  When you find out Ellen has like a half a billion dollars, you're like, oh my God, tell
*  me more about how mean she is.
*  I need to know the dirt.
*  It's just a common thing with people.
*  Someone becomes successful.
*  You're going to get scrutinized.
*  It's also like different perspectives.
*  For some people, the way I think and the way I talk is offensive to them.
*  They have a very clear cut idea of the way people should think and behave.
*  It's particularly on the left, which has become more and more weird because it would be much
*  easier for people on the left to label me if I wasn't left wing.
*  That's what's confusing.
*  It's because I do support basically every left wing position other than second amendment
*  and increasingly the way they attack the first amendment is weird.
*  They seem to think that censorship is okay as long as you're censoring someone who disagrees
*  with the way you think, which is a new thing in the left.
*  The acceptance of the first amendment, I brought this up before, but the ACLU.
*  The ACLU was founded by people that were literally supporting Nazis, like supporting actual neo-Nazi
*  groups and saying it like no-
*  Oh, and litigation for free speech issues.
*  This is important.
*  Even though their views are abhorrent, you have to support their ability to express themselves.
*  This is what the foundation of this country is about.
*  Free expression is the only way you find out what's right and what's wrong.
*  Shutting people down and stopping people from communicating is a silly, short-sighted approach
*  to debating an issue.
*  This is more and more common than ever on the left.
*  Because of deplatforming, because they have the ability with social media, because social
*  media is not really protected by the first amendment.
*  Social media, whether it's Twitter or YouTube or whatever, they're private companies and
*  they can decide, hey, we don't want this guy on because his views don't align with ours.
*  They have silenced people and kicked people off their platforms that really aren't doing
*  anything wrong.
*  They're saying things that the people that own and run the social media companies don't
*  agree with.
*  That to me is the weirdest aspect of the left today.
*  But other than that, gay rights, women's rights, civil rights, women's right to choose, I'm
*  with all that.
*  I'm with all of them.
*  I'm with universal basic income.
*  I'm with Medicare for All.
*  Really?
*  I'm not going to argue about that.
*  This is why I am.
*  This is why I am.
*  I think that it's not a bad idea to have a certain amount of money where you give it
*  to people in times like this COVID pandemic.
*  When you look at this pandemic, if people had a certain amount of money that came to
*  them every month and they didn't have to worry about food and they didn't have to worry about
*  housing like they were taken care of, you could see how it would be easier to get back
*  on track.
*  The way people are today, where more than 30 plus percent can't pay their rent, they're
*  on the verge of eviction and all the protections against eviction are about to run out.
*  This is a great example of where you do need big government.
*  This pandemic is the best example ever.
*  Or at least some sort of organized charitable organization where they really know how to
*  take care of people that run into hard times, especially hard times like this where it's
*  through no fault of your own.
*  The real argument against universal basic income is the same argument against a lot
*  of people we use against welfare.
*  You remove incentive.
*  You give people free money and you remove their incentive, you remove their motivation
*  and then you develop a whole class of people that relies on this and they've become accustomed
*  to it.
*  It's actually terrible for them.
*  It's terrible for everybody else.
*  I see that argument too.
*  That's what, when I look at that issue, that's one of the things I think about is, I don't
*  even want to pretend that I don't view things through my own lens, but when I look at myself
*  at pivotal points in my life and trying to get going, the fact that I was intensely motivated
*  by just trying to find a way to pay my rent and my cell phone bill, intensely motivated
*  by that.
*  I do wonder if you had alleviated me from that, what path I might have gone down.
*  I don't think of myself as being weird or that different.
*  So I wonder.
*  But in terms of when you're talking about the censorship and woke culture, there's a
*  guy I work with, Byron, and he was kind of, I feel like I'm sort of capturing his sentiment.
*  He was pondering how, if you think about in the 60s, right?
*  That it was like the right, they were the squares.
*  They were the ones like tis, tis, tis, like the disapproving, what are they doing now?
*  And he was noticing that the left has sort of taken over this air of disapproval.
*  Like my goodness, how could that young man say that?
*  Yeah, it's a lack of tolerance to alternative perspectives.
*  Someone should tell that young man to stop that.
*  You know what happened?
*  The social media, that's what happened.
*  People got the ability to complain where other people are going to listen.
*  There's just, there's so much signal out there.
*  There's so much noise.
*  So many people have the opportunity to complain about things.
*  And they're also formulating their complaints in a way they hope will resonate with people
*  that really have no dog in the fight.
*  So they just want to say something that people go, oh, that guy's got a good point.
*  Click.
*  I'll give him a little heartbeat for that.
*  You know what I wanted to ask you about, man?
*  I know that you've said this for as long as I've known you.
*  You don't pay attention to social media comments.
*  On a recent episode of yours, I heard you put it that you post something and run away.
*  But do you ever late at night sneak a peek?
*  No.
*  So you really don't break your own rule?
*  No, never at night.
*  Imagine if you see something at night and you're like, fuck that guy, and then it rolls
*  around your head.
*  It's terrible.
*  No, at night, I don't.
*  If I watch anything on my phone at night, it's super innocuous.
*  I like watching pool.
*  I like watching pool games.
*  I like watching maybe a science video or something like that, something very uncontroversial
*  and innocuous.
*  I don't allow myself to get into conflict at night.
*  I think that's very bad for your sleep and bad for your head.
*  If something bothers you, even something that is, even if I agree with them, even if someone
*  says something like, oh, he was kind of ignorant when he said that, or this is a stupid thing,
*  this is a bad perspective, even if I agree with the person that's saying that, I don't
*  want to read that at night.
*  I don't mind reading it in the morning and then thinking, yeah, good point.
*  Yeah, I could have handled that better.
*  Or yeah, maybe I should have looked at it this way.
*  I'm not without fault, but I don't think it's good to read that shit at night.
*  But reading that shit at any time, I'm my worst fucking critic.
*  I hate everything I do.
*  So if someone is just agreeing with the perspectives that I already have about things that I should
*  have said differently, and the other thing is most of the things I'm criticized on is
*  thinking on the fly, like doing this.
*  I don't have any idea what I'm about to say.
*  You don't either.
*  We're just talking.
*  So words pop in your head, ideas pop in your head, and you try to express them.
*  It doesn't always work out, and sometimes you're tired.
*  Sometimes you're hungover.
*  Sometimes you're not feeling so good.
*  Your brain doesn't always fire the exact same way.
*  My car is remarkably consistent.
*  You get in your car, as long as it's tuned up, you hit the gas, it responds in a way
*  that's very consistent.
*  Yeah, that's a good point, man.
*  My brain's not that consistent.
*  My brain's sometimes like a six cylinder, and sometimes it's like a fucking supercharged
*  V8.
*  It varies a lot.
*  Also, sometimes subjects come up that I didn't anticipate.
*  Occasionally I'll talk about something where I'm deeply studied on it.
*  It'll come up and I'll go, oh, no, no, no, this is why that is.
*  I get very excited, and I have a very clear idea of everything that's nuanced about that
*  particular subject.
*  Sometimes things come up and I'm like, oh, yeah, hmm.
*  I'm in the process of talking.
*  I'm kind of working it out in my own head, and I'm not exactly sure how I think about
*  it.
*  I'm trying to formulate opinions on the fly, or formulate a descriptive on the fly, or
*  try to tell a story that maybe I haven't really worked out in my head.
*  I'm trying to tell it while I'm thinking about it.
*  I'm also talking.
*  It doesn't always work out that good.
*  Yeah.
*  There's a thing I'm thinking about that's very similar to this.
*  Never mind.
*  I'll tell you an example of a thing that someone said to me that struck me as really funny.
*  I wanted to go and tell people what they said, but then I'm like, shit, I don't know if I
*  can tell people that they said that.
*  That's a weird one.
*  Yeah.
*  I get it.
*  Are you enjoying doing podcasts?
*  Is it?
*  Man, yeah.
*  It's my ... Of the things I do, of the various things I do for a living, it's the thing I
*  enjoy most actually doing it.
*  Having a guest on, for instance, there's a guest we have.
*  I bring him up because I was thinking of him, or this guy, Jim Heffelfinger from Arizona.
*  I bring him up because we're talking about criticism.
*  I'll always read criticism that he sends.
*  If he listens to something, or he's like, that's just not right.
*  It's not coming from a mean place.
*  It's coming from a place where he's trying to be additive to a conversation.
*  He'll send me some things and be like, hey man, this is a thing you should think about
*  and maybe want to clarify.
*  I'll open that email every single time.
*  He gives me a lot of them.
*  Yeah, that's different.
*  That's like a person you know.
*  It's a beautiful relationship.
*  Yeah.
*  It's like, but all criticism doesn't go that way because people want to see people bleed.
*  Here's this guy that doesn't want to see people bleed.
*  He just wants to advance the conversation.
*  But the time I had him on, we were having a conversation about biology, wildlife management.
*  And I'm just like the whole time, I'm thrilled by what I'm hearing.
*  Thrilled by the presentation.
*  Thrilled by what I'm hearing.
*  It's great information.
*  It's delivered well.
*  If you had a joy meter in your head, of all the things that you actually do, that to me
*  is, that interaction to me is great.
*  Because you're getting something out of it.
*  Whereas writing, it's almost trite to say, I kind of hate the actual act of doing it.
*  Not enjoyable.
*  Like actually doing it is not enjoyable.
*  Everything that comes out of it, I love, doing it is not enjoyable.
*  It's such a common thing to say.
*  I mean, Hunter S. Thompson famously hated writing.
*  That was a torturous thing to do.
*  I remember the writer Ian Frazier saying to me that when he was young and wanted to be
*  a writer, he imagined himself sitting at his typewriter, chuckling to himself.
*  Which isn't the reality.
*  Even when we're working on an episode, a show episode, and I get a rough cut, I don't get
*  a, when I open it, I open it with a sense of dread.
*  Not with like, oh boy, it's here.
*  It's not how I feel.
*  I open it, I'm like, ugh.
*  That's how I feel when I edit my stand-up specials.
*  Even if I know they were a killer.
*  Even if I know I killed.
*  I know I was there.
*  I'm standing ovation.
*  Everybody cheered.
*  Everybody laughed.
*  Fuck.
*  Sit down, I'm like, Jesus.
*  And I have to go over it, you know, and try to find what's the best camera angle and how
*  to, you know.
*  Yeah.
*  But I do like it a great deal.
*  It's funny that you're running, it changes conversation a little bit when you're talking
*  to someone like, if I have someone really good on, I'll sometimes, or someone that is
*  laying a lot of stuff on me that I wish I retained, I'll have to go back and re-listen to it.
*  Because it's kind of amazing.
*  I've always prided myself on being really good at remembering what people said.
*  Like if I'm fighting with my wife, and later we're fighting about the fight.
*  And she's like, well, you said, I said, no, no, no, no, it's not what I said.
*  I said, quote, and you said, quote, and I'll go to the grave with that, right?
*  Like I'm very good at remembering what people said.
*  And I'm shocked when I re-listen to a guest that I'm really excited to have on.
*  And they're like, it's an information heavy episode.
*  I'm shocked at all the stuff I missed.
*  Let me see, you wonder like, just the fact that there's a microphone and headphones,
*  like somehow I lose my ability to be a person who just like locks info up.
*  Well, it's also a good thing.
*  It just like locks info up.
*  Well, it's also because you're in the process of not just listening to what
*  they're saying, but you're steering the conversation.
*  You're trying to figure out how to respond, when to step in, when to not step in.
*  You have questions.
*  You don't know when to ask them.
*  Should I hold up?
*  Would I let this guy continue this thought?
*  I have to stop here because there's something weird.
*  But I don't want to make this uncomfortable.
*  And I want to miss anything out.
*  So there's all this shit going on that you're sort of managing the conversation.
*  It's not as simple as you just sitting there talking to somebody.
*  You're talking to someone and you know that other people are going to listen.
*  And it doesn't seem like it's an art form, but it's definitely an art form.
*  You get better at it and you also develop a way of expressing yourself that's entertaining
*  for people to hear.
*  It's not just that you're talking.
*  You're talking in a way where it smoothly and comfortably enters other people's brains.
*  Yes.
*  One of the ways I've noticed that, and I even had that problem, excuse me.
*  I even had that problem when we were having our little preamble chit chat here.
*  The presence of a microphone changes my thought pattern.
*  Oh yeah, for sure.
*  For sure.
*  You do get used to it though.
*  I feel like I feel way less inclined to say something really indefensible.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Well, that's the problem with the early days of my podcast is that we didn't have any
*  thought that people were actually listening.
*  When I did the earliest versions of the podcast, 10 years ago, 9 years ago,
*  we would just get barbecued and we would just talk shit as if no one was in the room.
*  If I sat down with Joey Diaz or Ari Shafir or one of my comedian friends,
*  we would just say the most ridiculous preposterous shit because that's how we talk
*  to each other when there's no one around because that's the things that we find funny.
*  When you're talking to a comedian, regular things aren't as funny.
*  It's like if you're going to show a boo boo to a guy who's an ER doctor and you've got a cut
*  on your finger, that's not impressive. I just saw a guy get shot in the head.
*  He needs more. I need more. I want to see an amputation.
*  You want to freak me out? Show me something that's like a real injury.
*  And that's how comedians are. There's an unfortunate aspect to those conversations.
*  If you take those conversations and you edit them out of context and then show it to people,
*  oh my God, these guys are horrible human beings. No, we're comedians and we're just talking shit.
*  You'd have to preface if you went around saying,
*  wouldn't it be funny if someone thought? Right. But even then they would cut that part out.
*  But that's what a conversation's like when you're just goofing on stuff with your friends.
*  But you just leave out the part where you say, wouldn't it be funny if someone thought?
*  Yeah. And you just say it as though it's coming from you. But everyone,
*  it's understood that you mean like, wouldn't it be funny if?
*  Right. Yes. Exactly. Yeah. It's a weird medium podcasts are because it's never really existed
*  before. This is a new thing. My friend Adam Curry is the original podcaster. He's the pod father.
*  He was the first guy to ever have a podcast. And he was an MTV DJ host. He actually lives here in
*  Austin. Oh, you remember Adam? I never put it together. That was the same person. That's Adam
*  Curry. Yeah. Beautiful, handsome man. He had those flowing. Oh yeah. No, I've known this, but I never
*  like, yeah. He runs the never put it together. The no agenda podcast. He's actually one of the
*  reasons I moved to Austin. He was saying Austin's praises and I had been here many, many times.
*  He's kind of like that Michael Jackson leather jacket. Yeah. Yeah. With the fold over flaps.
*  Handsome bastard. Look at that. Yeah. Oh, look at that hair. That's the same dude. Yeah. That's
*  the same dude. Now show a picture of him today. Uh, right there. Bam. That's him today. Yeah.
*  Yeah. He's the original. He's the OG. So he, oh yeah. But I never like,
*  you know, I can't think of a parallel here, but no, I'd like, I'm aware of these two.
*  Yeah. Right. But you hadn't put them together. Oh, that's the same guy. Oh no. Yeah. Yeah. He's
*  awesome. I love that guy. He's, um, he's got a great podcast called no agenda. It's his podcast
*  and, um, he, he really had the very first one and I don't think that was any earlier than 2000.
*  Jamie, what was that? 2005 maybe somewhere around then. So his podcast, his original podcast was
*  four years before my first podcast, which is 2009. So 2007. Okay. So two years before mine. So
*  you're talking about a guy, a thing rather that's only been around for 13 years. Like there was
*  never a thing where you could just put something out there, sit down, talk to people and there's,
*  there's no middle. Like people think like, because I have this deal with Spotify, that there's a bunch
*  of people sitting over my shoulder. You come in here, you see what it's like. There's no one here.
*  Like it's a skeleton crew. There's actually a sensor standing right next to me with a gun.
*  Um, it's exactly the same. It's, it's such a skeleton crew. And to have something,
*  like we did an election show last night that 7 million people saw to have something that has
*  a total skeleton crew. Doesn't make any sense that it could reach those kinds of numbers.
*  So this, this new form of communication, it hasn't been figured out yet. Like no one,
*  no one exactly knows its potential. No one knows exactly what the influence of it is. There's a
*  lot of mainstream media people that are really upset by it. That's also one of the reasons why
*  I get so criticized. People get so mad. They don't like the fact that I have this much influence.
*  They don't like the fact that so many people are paying attention that it doesn't seem right.
*  You know, that this is a, this is not from the New York Times. This is not from NBC. This is not from
*  whatever it's, but all of a sudden all these people are watching it. But this is a new thing.
*  So people haven't figured this out yet. Even though it's been around for 13 plus years,
*  they're still going, what the fuck is this? Like four years ago, no one took podcasts seriously.
*  Four years ago, Howard Stern had an episode where he was mocking podcasts and saying,
*  why don't you just yell out the window? No one's listening. It was like, you're wasting your time.
*  You waste you. And he was making fun of Adam Corolla for doing it. Oh, is that right? Yeah.
*  Making fun of people for doing it. And then now I think part of that was also, he's a smart guy.
*  And he was also in the middle of his renegotiation with Syria satellite radio. And he was probably
*  mocking comparisons to what he does with this huge organization, serious XM. Yeah. He was like,
*  he used to be like the lap dog of FM and then became like the lap dog of satellite. Yeah. Yeah.
*  But it's, I don't remember what my original point was, but no one- Brand new. Brand new. This is a
*  fucking really new thing. Yeah. I mean, I've told, I think I tell you this every time I come on your
*  show, but the first time I like ever heard the word podcast, I'm not joking. I had never heard
*  the word until Helen Cho told me about going on Joe Robbins podcast. And I was like, well, what?
*  I could, I could go and show you where I was sitting when I heard it. I remember you. She's
*  like, you just need to go. She's right. I was like, it's a what? A what? What? That's that'll never
*  work. Well, that was a lot of people's attitude. My, even like people that I was really close with,
*  like there's a comedy store documentary that just came out. It was a five part documentary.
*  And one of the episodes, my friend, Tom Segura was, who was on like episode two or some shit.
*  Like he was, he was on early, early, he's been on a fucking hundred plus times. I have no idea
*  how many times he's been on, but he was there in the early days and he's in the documentary.
*  He was talking to Brian Redband and he was saying like, what is he doing? Like, why is he doing
*  this? Redband was like, I don't know. Some people are listening. And he's like, can you go to the
*  list? And it's like 2000 people, like 2000 people were watching this. That's it. And you're spending
*  three hours doing this fucking stupid show for 2000 people for no money. Like, why are you doing
*  this? Yeah. But would you, would you imagine yourself being a visionary or do you imagine
*  yourself being that, that, you know, it was lucky, lucky. Yeah. No vision. No,
*  I've expected it to be the way it was forever. Like someday they'll make a, if they make a movie,
*  like the social network, not the social dilemma, but they make a movie like the social network,
*  which is about like Zuckerberg and those guys that come up on Facebook. They'll make like,
*  when they do the story of you, I wonder if they'll do it that, right. That you had a vision.
*  Well, let me put that to bed right now. I thought it was going to be the way it was back then
*  forever. No one paid attention, very small amount of people, but fun. It was a great way for it.
*  Look, I loved doing morning radio. I used to love doing it. I hated getting up. Oh, the call ins
*  to promote your shows. Well, not Collins. I'd go there. Like when I say if I was going to Phoenix,
*  you like those things. Loved it. It was fun. I'd get up in the morning, smoke a joint,
*  go in there with my friends and we talk shit. And if it was like the zany guy and then you have his
*  like his, his female counterpart who put him in his place. Exactly. You had to go in there and do
*  it at seven in the morning. Yeah, exactly. I used to love it. I used to love it because I would go
*  in like with Ari or Joey or someone like that and we would go and we'd have some fun and we'd say,
*  Hey, we're going to be the improv this weekend. And then they would say, so, you know, what's
*  been going on? What are you into? And then you have a story about this and about that. But that's fun.
*  That's fun. And you leave there and you have a good time with them. You know, like
*  eight out of 10 of them were a good time. Two out of 10 were like, this guy's gross. Like this,
*  this show sucks. Some people were clunky. They just, they're not good at it. They're just,
*  Oh dude, I'm like, when I used to have to do that for books, it was, I just thought that was the
*  worst thing that could possibly happen to a person. But when you're high and it's early in the morning
*  and you went to bed like three hours ago and you get up, at least you deal in comedy to go and be
*  like, well, you know, if you go back to the Lewis Clark expedition, you'll find nothing was expected
*  of me. Right. I was just like the silly person who hosted fear factor or was on a sitcom. And I would
*  come in and I would be in town to tell jokes. And like, that was what it was. So I always thought
*  like, particularly when I did, if I did like the Opie and Anthony show in New York, that was a
*  really fun one because those guys were on by, well, I first started doing it. It was on the
*  regular radio too, but they were on XM. And when they were on XM, you could swear. I was like,
*  this is amazing. You could swear. You could just go on. And it was a hang. Like you'd have like
*  four or five comedians in the room. We'd all just be on each other and laughing and, and you'd get
*  out of there like, God, it felt so good. It was so fun. Then you go get some breakfast, take a nap
*  and go do your shows. Did you used to do Stern ever? Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But that was a
*  different thing because Stern was like at the helm. It was never a hang, you know, it was the
*  Howard Stern shows, Howard Stern asking questions, you responding to those questions. And you know,
*  it was very historic that show. Like he was the, he's the first guy he like, if it wasn't for him,
*  there would be none of this. Like there was guys before, you know, there was like, I guess
*  Imus was one of those guys. I was never an Imus guy, but he was the guy who was nationally known
*  as the man who's who had this outrageous radio show. Yeah. You know, so, and that sort of helped
*  the Opie and Anthony show come to fruition. And then that, I think the Opie and Anthony show was
*  the, in a lot of ways, the Nexus. It was, it was a lot of ways. It was the idea that led to podcasts,
*  but when I was doing it, there was no thought in my head. Like, this is going to be just like the
*  Opie and Anthony show, or this is going to be just like Howard Stern to just, just, just you wait,
*  just you wait. There was none of that. I just keep showing up. And then one day I was at the Chicago
*  theater. I did this gig at the Chicago theaters, 3,700 people, right? Sold out show. And I go,
*  I had a story I was going to tell. I go, how many, how many people listen to the podcast?
*  Yeah. Oh, is that right? And I went, Oh shit. I'm putting that into my movie, man. And I remember
*  thinking, Oh, my movie is going to be called the Joe Rogan experience. But I remember very clearly
*  being, Oh no. Like, like, like almost a sense of dread, like shit. Like this is, this has gotten to
*  a place where I didn't know where it was. And it's already there. Cause I had been just doing it.
*  You know, I think by that time we were doing it at the ice house, we had this little room
*  off the, the comedy club at the ice house. We'd show up there and do it there. And it was just
*  bizarre. I was like, what happened? Like, cause you're just doing it like this, right?
*  Yeah. But you know, you know, you could say if you wanted to twist this and maybe I think,
*  I think you could say in your own defense is maybe I'm wrong here, but maybe you knew something,
*  maybe you knew more than you thought because you probably weren't doing 10 goofy things.
*  How so? What do you mean?
*  Meaning like, let's say I, um, went out and started 20 business, 20 goofy little businesses.
*  Right. Right. And then at some point, like, holy shit, like one of them took off. Yeah.
*  Turns out my business of selling old, um, ranch worn leather gloves to people who like, you know,
*  wish they had that look, uh, took off and made a little money. And then later I'm like, yeah,
*  you know, I always knew, but people would be like, dude, you were always like, you did all kinds of
*  stupid, everything, nothing ever worked out for you. Then all of a sudden, like this thing takes
*  off and you want to know, act like you like saw it coming. So I think that probably in the, you know,
*  probably in the back, it's good that you don't act this way, but probably in the back of your head,
*  you probably recognize that you were on, like maybe you recognize that you're onto something.
*  Nope. Definitely not.
*  I'm trying to help you out. Don't help me out. I'm telling you, it's not the case. It's just dumb
*  luck. I, I, I have a certain amount of brain damage. I don't know how much I have, but
*  definitely have a little. And I think part of it from getting hit in the head or not pharmaceutical
*  just getting punched. Gotcha. For sure. There's certain, there's a certain amount it's inevitable
*  from the time I was 15 till I was 21, I got hit a lot. There's, there's must be some. And because of,
*  I think there's a certain amount of not give a that comes with that. Yeah. Like literally.
*  You think that was kicked into your head. This is, I'm not joking. Sam Kinnison and
*  Roseanne Barr are the perfect examples that I use. Both of them were normal people and then they get
*  hit by cars. Sam Kinnison got hit by a truck and his brother who talks about it in his book called
*  brother Sam, his brother Bill wrote a book about it. It's like, there was one Sam and then Sam got
*  hit by a car and became a totally different person because of head trauma and then became wild
*  and impulsive and just became a maniac. That was the Sam Kinnison that we all knew and loved.
*  Same thing with Roseanne. One of the things when I was defending Roseanne, when she got in big
*  trouble and she came on the podcast to talk about it, I wanted people to understand what I knew
*  about Roseanne. And Roseanne was in a mental health Institute. She was in, she was institutionalized
*  for nine months after a car accident. She was hit by a car walking across the street when she was
*  15 years old and just fucking wrecked like massive brain trauma, like really never the same again.
*  Couldn't count. She was great at mathematics. She was a really an excellent student and then
*  hit by a car and then just wild and impulsive and they locked her in a mental institution for nine
*  months. She was crazy. She's like, like certifiably crazy, medicated on a whole bunch of different
*  things. And my take was like to make her responsible for things she said when she's been rewarded her
*  whole life for saying outrageous shit and she's on Xanax and she's smoking pot and she's drunk and
*  you just, you just want to label her as this awful, horrible person when America's loved her for
*  her whole life, for being the same, same way for being wild and impulsive. But my point is that
*  those two people were created that way from brain trauma. It made them wilder. There has, there's no
*  doubt I have some brain damage. There's no doubt. And when, when people say like, why aren't you
*  worried about criticism or why don't you? I think there's some of that there. There's gotta be some
*  of it where I, I, I've had enough trauma just to the right amount, just enough of these where it
*  doesn't bother me that much. God, I'm going to have you just full out, wop me on the head.
*  You think about the things that hold people back. One of the big things that hold people back is
*  fear. Right. They were, they're worried, they're worried about the repercussions. They're worried
*  about other people's reactions. They're worried about how you'll be viewed. They're worried about
*  these things. I don't have a lot of that for whatever reason. I mean, I don't want to hurt
*  anybody's feelings. I'm, I'm a genuinely nice person, but if someone doesn't like me, I'm like,
*  what the fuck am I going to do? Just keep moving. I think what, what happened with me with podcasts
*  is that all these people were telling me you're wasting your time. All these people were telling
*  me not to do it. Like, why are you wasting your time doing this? And all this thing is, eh, I like
*  doing it. I'm just going to keep doing it. Like I just didn't, it didn't like agents want to had
*  nothing to do agents to this day that I have that could have gotten in on the podcast, could have
*  gotten a piece, didn't want it. Do they double back around now? Oh yeah. They had a chance. Like
*  I need help with ads, like ads, like what the fuck are you doing? Wasting your time. We're here
*  doing real things. We didn't have time for this. Like they didn't want to have anything to do with
*  it. This is just, but I didn't, I didn't have some fucking grand vision. I just know what I like to
*  do. And when I like to do something, I go, Oh, I like to do that. I'm just going to keep doing that.
*  Like this is the same thing with martial arts, the same thing with bow hunting. Like the amount
*  of time that I spend practicing archery is fucking preposterous. It's ridiculous for a person who is
*  as busy as I am, but that's what I like. I like doing that. So I do that, you know, like I take
*  weeks off every year to go in the mountains and hunt because it's, I like doing that. I'm just
*  going to keep doing that. That's what I like doing. You know, when you earlier, we were reading up on
*  baccalaumes and it was saying how baccalaumes had been invented, um, multiple times, multiple times,
*  right. And all these dead end lineages. And you look at something, um, you know, flight, right?
*  Someone can be excused for coming in and seeing things, you know, dragon flying a bird,
*  right. And imagining that there was a, uh, like an event that, that spawned these things, right. But
*  in fact, they arrived at this like same place. They arrived at the same sort of place with like
*  winged flight through completely unrelated channels. You know, they just got there like on their own.
*  What's funny about podcasting is as podcasting, uh, takes itself more seriously,
*  it's like you have this sort of convergent, you know, it's from like divergent evolution
*  and convergent evolution, convergent. There's a convergent evolution with like news and podcasting.
*  It started out as a maybe like a somewhat of a revolt. You know, it was uncontrolled. It was
*  irresponsible. It was goofy. It was like a response to, but as it's become becoming,
*  become formalized with scrutiny, with ideas of responsibility, with, with ideas of like making a,
*  um, you know, usable, practical, respected product, there's kind of a convergent evolution
*  of driving it, um, back into the thing that maybe it was a response against in the first place.
*  Exactly. That's where the brain damage comes in. Cause I go get the fuck out of here. That's where
*  I go get the fuck out of here. I'm not doing that. When people say like, you can't have people like
*  Alex Jones on the podcast. You can't get drunk on a podcast that 10 million people are going to
*  watch. You can't smoke pot all the time. You can't deal with like, yes, I can. I've done it the whole
*  time. Like why am I stopping now? Well, now it's a big business. Now you have this big deal. Now,
*  you know, you're, you're, they're writing articles about you in the New York Times. Like now you have
*  to stop. But that's the way it got there in the first place. The way it got there in the first
*  place is people are tired of seeing these pre-packaged, like if you see like, here's the
*  best example, uh, evening news. Good evening. Hi, I'm skip, but fuck face, you know, there's these
*  guys with this fake voice doing this like super overproduced thing where they're talking about
*  subjects. The banter in between stories on fake news is, or on news rather, news broadcast is
*  the most fake communication known to man. Like the woman will say something. The guy will go, well,
*  that's certainly a crazy story. In other words, we're going to go to Bob outside and then they
*  go to this and that. And they're like, Oh, I find that's a, it's a terrible thing, a terrible
*  tragedy. Amazing. Terrible. Like you could see really inspiring. They're like, they have these like
*  weird little fake interactions that that is the opposite of podcast. Podcast is real. Like if that
*  was me and you played some video about some guy who decided he was going to try to do a backflip
*  over a Lamborghini and landed on his head. And I was like, I would be like, how the fuck does that
*  happen? Like you have a baby, like you have kids, you have a baby, like, look at my little baby,
*  like, and then your baby starts growing up and you're like, God, I'm so proud of him. He's a
*  little drawing you made. And then it gets to the point where he's on YouTube doing backflips over
*  Lamborghinis and landed on his head. Like what went wrong? Like that's how a normal human being
*  would talk. But you don't have that when you have a massively overproduced program, when you have
*  all these people that have a vested interest in that being successful. So you have executives,
*  you have producers, you have writers, you have all these people that have a piece of the pie.
*  So instead of having a Jamie and a couple of their folks that are security guys out there,
*  instead of that, I have what, a hundred people, like a normal show that reaches the amount of
*  people that this show does, there would be a staff of a hundred people. And those people would all-
*  Oh, absolutely, man. They'd have an enormous gate, the system of gatekeepers and legal.
*  Exactly. And then the things that you were going to talk about would be heavily vetted. You would
*  have people come in with pieces of paper and they would talk about, okay, in the first segment,
*  you're going to discuss whether Pennsylvania's vote is coming in. And let's be real clear that,
*  you know, here's the information that you have to go over. And there's none of that here. So
*  whether I'm good or bad, whether I'm right or wrong, at least you know it's just me.
*  This is the thing that we're worried about when it goes to Spotify. Like people are worried,
*  oh my God, they're going to have sensors in the room. There's going to be people telling them
*  what to do. What people are worried about is it becoming overproduced, it becoming something other
*  than what it is. Because they know that's the natural course of progression. Somebody gets a
*  hold of something that's wild and untamed and they go, we got to harness that and make a lot of money
*  off of it. But the way to make a lot of money off of podcasting is the opposite way, is to leave it
*  wild. But how are you going to leave it wild though, when all these people are paying attention to it
*  and all these people are criticizing it? You know, as we talked about, there's like, if a million
*  people know about your show or a hundred million people know about your show and just 1% of them
*  are mad at you. 1% of a hundred million is a million fucking people are mad at you.
*  Even if 99% think you're awesome, that 1 million could make a big dent in your head.
*  Can't pay attention to it. I think a way that they might invite you to look at it,
*  I'm not suggesting you do this, but I think the way they might invite you to look at it could be
*  captured by this article I read many, many years ago called the Radioactive Boy Scout.
*  It was about a kid who was working on some project where he needed to find some, you know,
*  Americium or something for some Boy Scout project he was doing. What's Americium? It's a radioactive
*  substance. So in smoke alarms, when you have a smoke detector, there's like a radioactive substance
*  in there and smoke inhibits the ability of the substance to hit a sensor. Really? So he started
*  buying up any and all smoke detectors that he could ever get his hands on, right? And then got
*  into that he could find, I can't remember what it was, like in old types of clocks, he was finding
*  some radioactive substance and he got himself a Geiger counter. He would drive around with a
*  Geiger counter on the front seat of his car past antique shops and shit, right? Okay. Is this a
*  novel? No, it was a story in Harper's Magazine called the Radioactive Boy Scout.
*  He winds up accumulating so much of this shit in the shed that not only like eventually when it all
*  breaks, like not only do they haul away the shed, they hauled away like his yard. How many did he
*  have? In barrels. How many did he have? I read it a long time ago. Wow. Okay. Just doing his thing,
*  collect the smoke. Oh my God, look at his face. So Jesus Christ. Yeah, hauled away his yard. Look at
*  his face. Like he's got radiation poisoning on his face. People might regard you as the Radioactive
*  Boy Scout. Yeah. Like at a time you were just out getting some smoke detectors because you want,
*  and then over time you like accumulated something where people had to take notice. There's a little
*  bit of that. And they would be like, dude, I understand, but you just can't put that many
*  of those things in one spot. But what's the argument against it? The argument against it
*  would tell me, you tell me. I don't hold that viewpoint. I'm just saying I like to, I like to
*  imagine, my brother has emerged as someone who's like highly critical of my occupation. And I'd
*  like to hear him out about it. Danny or Matt? No, Matthew. Why? What's he critical of? He is,
*  well, give me the counter argument. No, what's he critical of? Oh, why doesn't he like what I do
*  for a living? Because he feels that me and other individuals and lots of people, that by talking
*  about and celebrating an activity, in my case, hunting, fishing, that it creates that my
*  that my enthusiasm's become infectious and it increases the number of people and diminishes
*  the quality of the experience that people who've always hunted will have because of competition.
*  Very valid argument, right? So I like to hear him out on it. I like to hear him out on it because
*  he's smart. He's smart. So I like to hear him out on what he's thinking. I'm only doing the same
*  thing with you by, I don't hold your opinion. I don't hold the opinion of someone, but I'm just
*  saying like it is, someone might say, I get it, Joe, it was all fun. It wasn't supposed to happen.
*  But they would say like, but here you are, like here you are, you now have a level of power that
*  is, that could be dangerous. But what could be dangerous about it? Picture that, picture that
*  you said something like it's over now and everybody was all worried about it happening
*  during the election, but picture that you said like, man, I think that if you're in that
*  county, you should go down to the polling place and do X. A lot of dudes, right? So you
*  wield like a level of influence. And I think that you probably
*  now and then bite your tongue. Well, I definitely don't tell people how to vote.
*  No, no, I don't mean, I don't mean how to vote. I mean, like I was just, I was doing a poor example
*  of that. But that's a good example because that would be where it could get dangerous. Like what
*  if I had an idea that was really not well thought out and not good for the general public and I was
*  you threw out cause it was funny. Yeah. Yeah. And then I told people to go do it. I thought it'd be
*  fun. A fun stunt. Let's see how many people we can get to, or you're just, you're just amusing. Yeah.
*  Yeah. I could see that, but that'll, that alarms people because people would do it. Yeah. But I
*  don't do that. Most of what I do is talk about ideas and talk shit and talk about things that
*  are happening already. Yeah. I employed people in Missoula County, Montana to go vote for my
*  sister-in-law Juanita Vero and she won by a landslide, but I think she was going to win anyway.
*  Well, that's awesome. That's a good thing. She's a County commissioner. There you go. I got,
*  I got tangled up in politics there for a minute. There's a real problem with the gatekeepers is a
*  real problem with these heavily produced television shows, heavily produced radio shows. And even now
*  internet shows, there's a real problem with them is that there's inauthentic voices. They don't
*  resonate with people. I know that's not a real person. That's not a person that's unfiltered.
*  That's a person that's getting scripts. They're wearing makeup. They have a team of people that
*  are attending to them and telling them what to do and how to say it. And there's a lot of other
*  people again, behind the scenes that are all like paying attention to everything you do. And they'll
*  come in, in between takes and scenes. You know, there's a, there's an interview with Donald Trump
*  with this woman from CBS, very contentious interview. And he wound up putting the whole
*  interview online. Are you aware of that? No. This woman was criticizing him and asking him questions.
*  And he was like, you know, the way you talk to me, you would never talk to Joe Biden like this. And
*  60 minutes wound up using a very small percentage. Was it 60 minutes, Jamie? Yeah, they wound up using
*  a very small piece of it. But during the full one that Donald Trump put out, like they interrupt the
*  conversation because one of the producers is like, the American flag is blowing in the background
*  because of the air conditioning and it's kind of distracting. And he's like, well, huh? And so the
*  guy like stops everything because he thinks that the flag is distracting. Like no one can see the
*  fucking flag. It doesn't matter. Like, what are you talking about? But this is what happens when you
*  get a whole crew of people. You get so many chefs in the kitchen and some guy just decides that he's
*  going to stop the conversation between the fucking president of the United States who's getting
*  grilled by this lady because he doesn't like the way a flag is moving. That to me symbolized
*  everything that's wrong with heavily produced and overly produced television or one of the things
*  that's wrong. Right. What's really wrong is they push the agenda. They push what you're going to
*  talk about when you'll, they'll decide who your guests are. There, no one has any say in who my
*  guests are. I choose all of them. I choose the day they come in. I choose what we're going to talk
*  about. There's the conversations are only what I'm interested in things I'm interested in. So I
*  don't have to fake anything. Like I love talking to you. I was excited to talk to you today. I get
*  excited. Woke up this morning. I've arrived. Steve Rennel is going to be here. There's no like,
*  Oh, who, who do we have to talk to today? That shit never happens. That's why it resonates. All
*  these shows where it's heavily produced and, and you know, you just try to get the biggest celebrities
*  in. And like, there's a really disturbing video from, of Howard Stern from like 2013 to somebody
*  leaked and it's him giving some speech in front of all of his employees talking about getting the
*  show to become more popular. This is what we have to do. And we have to get, you know, X amount of
*  celebrity need to a list and to be list a week. And I was like, wow. Oh really? Yeah. I was like,
*  damn. And they're there telling people to make fake Twitter profiles and tweet to celebrities. And
*  I watched this like, yeah, that's too bad. Yeah, exactly. That was my feeling too.
*  As a person who was a gigantic fan of him growing up, it's like, I didn't, I never thought he thought
*  like that. I never thought anybody would do that. This is one of the best things about podcasting,
*  at least with the way some people do it, it's just authentic. It's just raw. So when people hear it
*  with stumbles and all, they know this is just two guys talking. This is two girls talking.
*  It's what it like that, that show, what is that called? The caller daddy. Yeah. Yeah. That became
*  real popular because it's obviously just these, where these chicks are talking. They just talk
*  that way. They, and, and people like, oh my God, like this is how we talk when we're with our
*  friends and they people, it resonates with them. You can't get that on the view. You can't get that
*  on these heavily produced bullshit shows that are on television. We have a million producers and
*  everybody cuts in between commercials and fixes people's hair and you're super self-aware. That's
*  what happens on those things. It's weird that people come in with notes and the producers like,
*  maybe we can bring up this in this episode. I know you like to talk about this, but let's be aware
*  that people think that and you think this and this is a, and this is, we've got it shows that whenever
*  you talk about this people tune out. So we've got to stop talking about that. So they show all this
*  research and all these metrics and like, they fuck it. It gets all fucked up. What resonates
*  with people is authentic, authentic conversations. And you don't get authenticity when you have
*  overly produced things with a hundred people's ideas all shoved into one person's mouth. You do,
*  it doesn't work that way. So the more these podcasts get bigger and bigger, the more they fall,
*  they fall apart because too many people get involved. You've too many people shift them and
*  mold them and change them. And then they become just like everything else. All these other
*  overproduced things. And look, there's some overproduced things that are really good.
*  You know, like the tonight show with Johnny Carson, you could watch it to this day. You're like,
*  wow, that's a fucking really good show, but it wouldn't work today. It wouldn't because now
*  it's like you have water in your ears and you don't know you have water in your ear. And then
*  it comes out, you're like, oh, that's what hearing is like. I can hear better. If someone put that
*  water back in your ear, you'd be like, what the fuck's that water doing in there? I know what it's
*  like to have no water in my ear now. That's a bad analogy, but you get what I'm saying.
*  I'm giving what you're saying. People are, they're accustomed to this thing now where you,
*  you know, that's just, there's no filter between you and that person. You're in the room. Like
*  that's how I feel when I listen to your show. Like it's you and whoever's in there with you.
*  That's it. There's no, like one show that I really liked, I liked a lot of your shows,
*  but one show that I really liked was the one we talked to with the author whose book got turned
*  into the Revenant. Yeah. Yeah. Michael Punk. That that's spelled P-U-N-K-E. Yeah. That's a great one.
*  I can't remember. No, I think it's, I think he doesn't pronounce the E. Shit. I don't think
*  it's Michael Punky. I think it's punk. Damn. Sorry, Michael. But you, cause you have such a
*  great knowledge of that subject and you know, he, he does as well and you're, you're asking him,
*  what is this and what is that? What was it like for you when they, instead of doing it on the
*  planes, they decided to do it in a rainforest in the Pacific Northwest? Like what the fuck was
*  that like? And you're talking to them like it's real clear. There's, this is just you and that guy
*  and you know, Janice and whoever else is there. There's, there's no agenda. There's no filters.
*  There's no producers. So it's, it's intriguing to a person because it resonates. It gets in the head
*  easy. It slides right in there. That, that story though is a little bit, in some ways might have a
*  little bit to do with a sense of responsibility or something because I had taken so many swipes
*  over the years at my, swipes at the movie, the Revenant, and voiced my dissatisfaction
*  with that movie so much that I believe it went like this. I believe the author then reached out
*  or a friend of the author reached out to say, you know, he's really aware of your, how much fun you
*  guys have with the movie. And I was like, duh, she probably have the guy on. But it was because
*  of historical inaccuracies, right? It wasn't no fault of his. That's why I tried to make it clear.
*  Like he, I think what it is, I don't even think he lives. I think he heard that we're always hacking
*  on him. He thought we were hacking on him. On him. And I was like, I'm not hacking on him.
*  We're hacking on the movie. The fact that I wanted to get with them. I wanted to get with them to be
*  cool. Isn't it always a problem when someone takes a movie that's based on a real historical
*  event and they distort that historical event just for film? Just for like an example that I always
*  use is that movie, was it Dreamcatcher? Was the movie, Foxcatcher, Fochcatcher. Oh yeah.
*  Yeah, the wrestling, the Olympic wrestling team movie. Based on a real wrestler, Mark Schultz,
*  who fought in the UFC. And in the movie, a lot of things take place that I don't know whether or not
*  they took place because I'm not intimately connected to the movie, but I'm intimately
*  connected with the UFC. And when Mark fought in the UFC, he fought a famous fighter. It's a famous
*  fight. It's a historical fight. He fought as a wrestler against a guy named Big Daddy Goodrich.
*  Gary Goodrich was a famous fighter. He was a famous pioneer of the sport. In the movie,
*  the only fight that Mark has ever had his entire career, the MMA fight in the UFC, in the movie,
*  he fights a Russian guy, a white guy. They change it. Instead of Big Daddy-
*  Wasn't the same dude that Rocky had to fight.
*  No, but it's not the same dude. But they took a historical event and they distorted it for no
*  reason. You could have had him fighting Big Daddy Goodrich. You could have had Big Daddy,
*  because Big Daddy also wore a gi. He famously would go into the octagon with a karate outfit on.
*  He had his gi on. In the movie, there's a guy with a fucking bare shirt, a white guy,
*  or a bare chested. It didn't make any sense. Why would you change reality? As an MMA fan,
*  I know what happened. It's a historic fight. It would be like when Muhammad Ali fought Sonny
*  Liston. If instead of Sonny Liston, you had him fight some fat white guy. Why would you do that
*  when everybody knows what happened? That's a historic movie where someone,
*  exactly what we're talking about with podcasts, with anything else, overproduced,
*  someone got their greasy little fucking fingers on it and they decided to change reality.
*  I think that it comes from a couple places and I've been a witness to it a little bit.
*  I think it comes from people wanting to exert creative influence.
*  Yeah.
*  And also people, three things. Why do exert creative influence? Wishing that
*  the truth had been different.
*  That doesn't make any sense.
*  And a third one, that's kind of like too combined with the second one, but to
*  tell you which things have been different, I remember actually having a conversation like
*  this with a producer one time about filming, hunting things. We were like, well, how do you
*  do it? How do you cut this thing up? They'd be like, man, you could do it with a scalpel.
*  It's very precise. I use a very small knife to do it. And no joke being like, could you do it
*  with a machete? Because in their mind, there's not the respect for how things are done.
*  It's so show business that you're viewing, you're not in love with how someone did something.
*  You're in love with like what the end product could be visualized as, meaning it's more
*  arresting in their mind to see someone cut something up with a machete. Like they can picture it.
*  Right.
*  So why be inhibited? Why be inhibited by the reality? And I think a lot of people would
*  look and be like, oh no shit. You could do that with a scalpel.
*  Right.
*  And they love that fact.
*  Yeah.
*  But some people don't love that fact.
*  Well, we're talking about those little havelon type knives. When I first saw that, I go, oh,
*  that's genius. And then I thought, oh, well, of course, it makes sense. Like you're surgically
*  cutting up parts of an animal. It does make sense. But the difference between that is like,
*  this is a physical act that hasn't taken place yet. You're about to do it and you're going to
*  film it. We're talking about as a historical event. And that's where it's a real problem,
*  especially for someone who's a, I mean, I'm kind of a martial arts historian.
*  Now you asked me about the UFC. I know a lot. Like you can't lie to me. You can't say that
*  Mark Schultz fought some Russian guy. Like that's nonsense. It doesn't make any sense.
*  That is just a producer who thinks, ah, people won't know. People won't know. Just do it anyway.
*  Yeah.
*  Some guy's ego.
*  Won't know and don't care.
*  Greasy fingered motherfucker who wants to come in and ruin something because he has his own ideas
*  of how to, you know, how to put his little touch in it. He's about, I turned it into the white guy.
*  Like he's sitting in the movie theater. This was my idea. They wanted to give it a black guy from
*  Canada wearing a gi. That's who he was. Big Daddy Goodrich is from Toronto. I mean,
*  Big Daddy Goodrich is famous. That's why this is crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  Like Mark Schultz is famous too. Like this was the first time an Olympic gold medalist
*  in wrestling competed in the UFC. We got to see this insanely dominant wrestling,
*  where he just took him down any time he wanted to and just completely controlled the fight.
*  It was really fascinating. And because he was a coach for Brigham Young,
*  believe it was Brigham Young University, they told him he can't keep fighting.
*  Like you're going to coach wrestling, you can't do this cage fighting thing.
*  Because this is early UFC. No gloves. You can wear shoes. Like the rules were like real squirrely.
*  It was a totally different thing than it is now. It was one way, maybe two weight classes back then.
*  One or two weight classes. That's it. And so for them, it was like distasteful. Whereas now
*  maybe they would look at that as an opportunity to get amazing publicity for the college. Look,
*  our head guy is a UFC champion. Because Mark Schultz could have been a UFC champion, no doubt
*  about it. No one was going to stop that guy from taking him down. I mean, he was like one of the
*  best wrestlers to ever wrestle. And they-
*  He was the one played by not Mark Ruffalo. Mark Ruffalo is the older brother.
*  Right. Mark Ruffalo is the older brother. And the older brother, Dave Schultz, had get murdered by
*  this DuPont guy. It's a crazy story. Are you familiar with the Charlton Heston movie,
*  I believe it was from 1980 called The Mountain Men? No.
*  It's a period piece about free trappers, like beaver trappers. Based on real humans?
*  Uh, just informed from a hodgepodge of events, informed by a hodgepodge of actual events. So
*  there's an element in there, very detailed elements stolen from John Coulter's life with
*  an event called this come to be known as Coulter's Run. There's some characters that are these
*  amalgams of different people who kind of drifted in and out of that time in the 1830s and 1840s.
*  There it is.
*  They do a great job with costumes. But the beaver trap, they're beaver trappers. The trapping scenes
*  are in like laughably bad. And you wonder why they didn't just bring someone in to have them,
*  like it would have been so, it would have been less effort to have the beaver sets they're
*  making make sense. But they're like, they just, someone out there just doesn't care.
*  They don't care. I had a conversation. It's also one of those movies where all the
*  native Americans are, well, except for the, the heroin, like the native Americans are
*  blundering idiots. Oh God. Yeah.
*  What year was this? I believe it was made in 1980. Yeah, there it is. Yeah. Um, I had a
*  conversation once when I was just starting to get into acting. Um, I had, uh, I think maybe
*  I'd just been cast in a news radio and I've got brought, maybe not even, I'd been brought in to
*  meet with these producers because they knew I had a martial arts background. They wanted to talk
*  about me doing a martial arts movie. And the interview did not go very well because they
*  were talking about, um, things in movies, like all these wild scenes. And they were asking me
*  what I like. And I go, well, I like things that are realistic. I want, I want to see something
*  that I know would work. Like if, if a guy, you know, jumps up and split kicks two people and
*  knocks them across the room, like that doesn't, I don't, I go, I want to see like realistic
*  scenarios where, where a person who knows martial arts can go all that. That's pretty bad ass.
*  Like, like Chuck Norris, give him all the shit you want, but there's a lot of Chuck Norris movies.
*  We had like real realistic fight scenes. Like, um, what was the cop movie Chuck Norris did?
*  Lone Wolf McQuaid? No, no, that was the one we fought. Uh, David Carradine. There was a,
*  is that how he fights? Like no matter, like they, they killed his dog and then he got pissed.
*  That was pushing it too far. There was one movie with it where Chuck Norris did,
*  oh God, it's not the thin blue line. Is it? What is it? Code of Silence. That's right.
*  That was a movie where it was a real movie. Like it wasn't, it wasn't just like a karate movie.
*  It was like a real movie. It was a good, it was like critically, it was probably 1980 as well.
*  Like what year was that movie? Here he is in a bar next to this speaks to you, Joe,
*  cause he's by a pool table getting ready to karate fight. 85. Yeah. I was everything you like.
*  It wasn't too outrageous. It was like, he was really fighting. Like it made, it made sense.
*  Like you could see that happening. Maybe that's not the best example. You know,
*  who's a good example is weird as it sounds. Steven Seagal's early movie above the law.
*  And a lot of people hate saying that. I fucking loved above the law. That Steven Seagal movie,
*  when he fucked people up in a bar, like you believed it. I'm like, he's not doing jumping,
*  spinning wheel kicks or anything like that. He's cracking people over the head with pool cues and
*  breaking their arms. It's like that all that stuff. Like, okay, I buy that. I buy that.
*  I would someday like you to do a lie, like an analysis, a sort of director's cut style analysis
*  of the fight scene at the end of cannonball run. This is Steven Seagal walking in the dude. This
*  was back when he was lean. I met him in a, I met him in a catfish joint in Oxford, Mississippi,
*  a catfish place. They're getting fried catfish. Really? Do you remember when he was a real cop on
*  a television show? People got mouthy with him in this movie and it's not a good move.
*  Bang, he starts fucking people up. See that? Look at that elbow, that upward elbow. 100% legit,
*  100% real move that you see in Muay Thai all the time. That's real. That Kevin Ross can be doing
*  that right now, right there. Bam. That's 100% legit. Knee to the face. All legit. That stuff
*  makes sense. Look, this guy's going to swing. Boom. All this shit. This is real. This is,
*  this is Steven Seagal at his best. These are like legit believable fight scenes. Oh, now he's going
*  to get, but watch this. Even the way he was, Steven Seagal, people talk a lot of shit about
*  him, but Steven Seagal was a legit, a keto master. Like he was one of the first, if not the first
*  American to teach at a dojo in Japan. He taught a keto. He was 100% legit. When I met him, he was
*  wearing some kind of robe. He lost the script somewhere along the line. But back then, during
*  this movie, man, I fucking loved that guy. And I remember bringing him up in the meeting and I'm,
*  and I'm bringing this scene up and like, that's, that's what I want to see. I don't want to see
*  shit that I know won't work. And they weren't into it. And they were like, people don't know that. I
*  go, but I know that. And he goes, yeah, but how many people are you like you were out there? You
*  know, I go, but that movie is a successful movie. And the guy got upset at me. He just didn't want
*  to hear me criticizing his perspective on something that I was an actual expert in.
*  Has GQ asked you to do one of those breakdowns? Would you? Of a karate scene in a movie? Well,
*  no, they like, I've done the breakdown where you watch all the hunting scenes. Oh, have you done
*  that? Yeah. Yeah. It's fun. I'd probably do that without GQ. I don't want them in the mix. You
*  don't need them in there. Why would I want, why would I want anybody else in there? Then you have
*  a producer, then you have a big organization behind you when you could just do it here.
*  You could just spark up a joint and go, yeah, all right. Yeah. Cause they kind of like pull the,
*  I don't know why, like I didn't, I had fun. They get the rights to things maybe. Well, it just like,
*  they kind of like put it out. I don't know. It was like they played, they pulled all, and I actually
*  pointed out a bunch of hunting scenes and movies for them. And then they did their homework and
*  found a bunch more and they just play you hunting scenes for movies. Cameron Haynes did that with
*  archery and that's correct. And the, you know what he said to me? He said, the best is that movie
*  brave, that animated movie brave. He's like the girl's form is excellent. Is that right? Yeah.
*  Like she does everything perfect. Like because it's animated, you don't have to teach an actor
*  to do it. You could just mimic a, like a professional archer doing it. Like see if you can find like a
*  scene, the archery scene in brave. Well, whether you do with them or not, I feel like a good fight
*  scene breakdown would like, would, would be like a gift to society. Maybe, but that, like that scene
*  in, above the law, that's all legit. Like maybe not the, the flipping the guy on the ground that
*  was holding the gun. Let me see if we can see the girl pull the bow. Would it be a good parody? Look
*  at this. Watch this. Watch her. Her technique. I mean, even the way she's holding the bow,
*  it looks like a real human. Oh, she's got some corset that's holding her back. Look at that.
*  Look at that. I mean, her, her technique looks perfect. Oh, they must have. Look, I mean, that
*  was perfect. Yeah, you're right. Looks good. What I wanted to do. So this, this franchise,
*  this GQ franchise is called the breakdown. I wanted to do a parody of the breakdown where an expert
*  comes in and analyzes diarrhea scenes from movies. Well, that would never actually happen because
*  like the scene from, uh, what was the movie? Yeah. Dumb and dumber was a good one. That,
*  that volume of, uh, excrement would never actually be generated by that size. You'd be dead. Yeah.
*  But there's something about people when you get too many people, too many minds,
*  too many, too many, too much influence, you know, just that it was a thing that that point was a
*  thing that, Oh, the toilet scene. So that was the thing that shocked me originally about doing,
*  about doing books is I remember, um, to this is not to discredit my agent, but I remember having
*  a conversation with my publisher and we kind of like, um, over lunch one time hit on an idea for
*  a book and she seemed to like agree with the idea and it's just two of us in a room and she had,
*  she had an imprint and could make that call at random house and we're like talking. I'm like,
*  you know, I think it'd be really cool. And I left the lunch and called my agent and said, like,
*  I think I maybe just kind of sold a book, you know, you should call and double check. And
*  to think that like a thing of that level of impact would come about with just that,
*  I remember being really inspired by that. That's what should happen, right? Yeah. But that's like
*  the amount of people that are going to go read a book. So there you put a thing out that you feel
*  is of influence, a fraction of a fraction of what is going to hear you talk. Yeah. And there's,
*  and there's not even two people in the conversation about who you're going to talk to.
*  Yeah, it's weird. You've reduced it. You've reduced it down to a single point,
*  but people know what to expect. Like people that listen to the show, like I'm,
*  my ideas evolve. Yeah. I get interested in new things, but I'm always me.
*  You know, it's not, I'm not a product. I'm not a thing that someone has concocted. I'm not a thing
*  that someone like when there's certain people that are on like late night, you know, like,
*  certain people that are on like late night television, we hear them talk. You'll man,
*  I want to get that guy drunk. Yeah. I want to know what that guy's got. Like I don't buy it.
*  I don't buy it with me. If you like me or don't like me, you know, exactly what I am.
*  And also it's not a lot of, uh, men that are allowed to just be like a regular man
*  on TV anymore or on anything. What are they supposed to be like? You gotta be some fucking
*  half neutered thing. Oh, you know, you have to, all, all evidence of toxic masculinity must
*  be removed from the way you think and behave. You can't be like a guy would be if he's just
*  hanging out with his friends. Like that's problematic. It's problematic to distribute
*  mainstream. Like there's so many men out there that feel like they don't have anybody that
*  represents the way they think. So one of the things I think that resonates with this show is
*  because there's no filter, because there's no, there's no executives that tell you what to do.
*  I could just be myself. There's a lot of people like me out there. To your credit. Uh,
*  I think that you're very, very open about the, I, the, the evolution of your thought.
*  And you're very open about ideas that you're not trying on, but you're open about
*  your thought process. Meaning that you'll voice something and, and do a good job of voicing that
*  you're aware that there's probably more to the story. Yeah. You have, well, I'm not married to
*  my ideas. I think that's important. I think there's like, there's like a sub, there's like a subtext
*  there. And I think that someone could even look at transcripts of what like could look at
*  transcripts of what you say and not, and get a false idea of it, where if they listen to you,
*  it would carry with it the lack of like the, the lack of certainty as you hear a new piece
*  of information and discuss it. Right. That's what we're saying, which is a little bit important.
*  When people are always mad about something Trump said, like you go to the New York Times,
*  you read like Trump said this horrible thing, and then you go and find the video.
*  Exactly. Like for instance, I remember when everybody's all worked up because Trump, um,
*  referred to Pompeo, you know, as the secretary of the deep state, which I thought was funny.
*  Okay. Yeah. Everybody's all angry about it. Um, well, you know, the magnitude, then you go watch
*  the video. I'm like, the dude's make is like, he just making a joke. Like he's funny. Yeah.
*  It was like everything about the interaction was a joke. That was in the interview with CBS,
*  the same sort of thing. The interview with CBS, the woman brought up a thing. And he's like,
*  that's not what I said. What I said was a joke. I was joking. I said it like this. This is,
*  I'm joking. I'm being sarcastic. I'm being silly. That's what I do. Yeah. Like he was saying that,
*  explaining to her, like you're saying it in a different way than I said it. That's not how
*  I said it. Like she was trying to say a thing in her words. Like you said, and she says it this
*  way. He's like, that's not what I said. I said it like this. Like, and he says it the way he said it.
*  And you go, oh, he's fucking around. Yeah. But they're trying to distort what he said because
*  it makes a better narrative. The narrative that he's an asshole. I could go on all, well,
*  I don't want to get into too much, but I could go on all day about legitimate complaints someone
*  might have with like the administration. But the thing about him, like the thing about him
*  saying funny things and that making people mad, like I really don't, I kind of a little bit
*  appreciate the humor sometimes. He's an awesome troll. I mean, that's one of the ways he got so
*  much attention during the 2016 election. He would say outrageous shit knowing that the media was
*  going to complain about it. And they were just giving him free advertising because he was saying
*  things you're not supposed to say when you're running for president. And when he was saying
*  it, they're like, this is outrageous. And they thought they were sinking him. They're like,
*  we're going to show what a bad person he is. And people would watch him say it and they
*  played him for fools. They gave him free advertising. And you know, it's a, we're in
*  a weird place for people that might listen to this someday. Uh, no one knows who the president is
*  right now. Um, the election has been, went on last night, but it hasn't been decided. And it might
*  not be decided for three or four days. They think that Pennsylvania is the big one and, uh, they
*  don't know who's going to win Pennsylvania. And if he wins Pennsylvania, apparently he wins. Maybe
*  if he wins one other state in Pennsylvania, he wins. But if he loses Pennsylvania, Biden wins.
*  And, um, it could be real weird. Do you think you'll launch a, do you think you'll run for
*  president someday? Me? No fucking chance. That's a terrible job. It seems like they just distort
*  who you are. They, uh, they, they push a narrative. They, they say things about you that are horrible.
*  They, they do ads where they're just trying to break down your character and depends on who the
*  establishment is for or against. I mean, what they're doing with, uh, Biden has been extraordinarily
*  weird where they're ignoring all of his gaffes. They're ignoring all of these like, like real
*  legitimate. I don't think you can say that they're ignoring his gas. I mean, you can go watch
*  gaff compilations. Yeah, but not on CBS, not an NBC, not his, not his allies. Look, anybody who
*  is in the news is not in the news. You're in the news. You're in the business of distributing the
*  news that you want people to see. Like you don't want people to see him thinking he's running for
*  Senate. He's like, well, the reason why I'm running for Senator, you know, like, like, you don't want
*  to hear that. So they don't show it. They, they take away all the times. He forgets what he's
*  talking about. They, they don't say they don't, there's no thing that they've ever had on CNN is
*  where they have a legitimate conversation and whether or not he can hang in there for four years.
*  Forget about eight. Like how much cognitive decline has this man experienced? You don't feel
*  that they discussed that? Not on CNN. No, no, no, they haven't. They avoid it like the plague.
*  They avoided the Hunter Biden emails. They avoided all that. They, they avoid so much.
*  They avoid so many different things that would be detrimental to him because
*  in large part, because they believe they covered that stuff too much in 2016 with Hillary. When it
*  came to the emails and deleting the 30,000 emails and on the, then the FBI reopening the investigation
*  right before the election. And that could have cost her. And they've decided their approach this
*  time. They've decided that Trump is bad and he's a danger to democracy. And so they're only going
*  to cover the news that they think is important. Well, the problem with that is then you, you open
*  up the door to Fox news, being able to say, why aren't these other people covering this?
*  They're not covering this because they're biased and it's fake news. And these, these people are
*  criminals. This is all legit. This is all happening right now. This is real stuff. Here's Joe Biden
*  stumbling. Here's Joe Biden. You know, saying things that don't make any sense. Here's Joe
*  Biden. Over and over and over again. You know, you don't vote for me. You ain't black. All that
*  crazy stuff. They're not, they're not highlighting all that. Super Thursday. Yeah. It's, he's a mad
*  man. It's like, it's, it's weird, but it shows you that the news is not just the news. It's the news
*  for the left and the news for the right. You don't just get some unbiased source. I think that it's,
*  I think that people who aren't on that are, are either feigning ignorance,
*  like, like people who don't think that there is an inherent bias within news organizations,
*  within long-term legacy news organizations, they're either like feigning interest, feigning
*  ignorance because it benefits them or they're just flat out like, like naive.
*  But there's never been this obvious where they're just ignoring really hard. You don't want someone
*  to be president if they can't think right. Right. Someone's showing a real clear sign of cognitive
*  decline. You don't, you're supposed to highlight that. Like this is part of the news, but they had
*  already picked him to be the guy running for the democratic party. And they just, they just decided
*  to just ignore all that shit. Yeah. But like I read the New York times. So I go to Jamie. Yeah. I just
*  after what you were saying that I'm reading updates now, they've as of now they've called
*  Wisconsin for Biden. Arizona has not officially been called, but I'm seeing that it's called.
*  And if he just wins Nevada and Michigan, which he's currently up in, that's enough to give him 270.
*  It doesn't matter about PA. Doesn't matter about Pennsylvania at that moment. Oh, so Biden's going
*  to win. That I, I don't know. That's the part of like, I've, I heard last night, I think it was
*  Carl Rove actually that was saying on Fox news that this reporting number is not accurate because
*  they have no idea how many people voted right now and how many mail-in ballots are in the early
*  ballots are sitting out there. So saying that like 99% or 95% as in that might not be a good
*  accurate number to go off. And this is for which state? Any, any of the, any of the states. Yeah.
*  So the closest ones right now are Nevada, Michigan and Georgia. Wow. Just look how close they are.
*  Oh dude, they're down to reporting like, like chunks of 3000 votes. It's fucking nuts, man.
*  And the Trump administration, I think has said they're already filed a lawsuit to stop the
*  counting in Michigan. What does that mean? I don't know. Why? I understand how you, like,
*  why would you want to stop counting? I understand. Like how can you justify the argument that you
*  want to stop counting? Yeah. But they want to keep counting in Arizona. But what's the, like,
*  I wish I understood. What is, what do they mean stop counting? I don't know. So it looks like
*  Arizona's lost 51% to 47%. That's a big gap. A hundred thousand gap with 80. Well, it's only
*  84. So they have 16% of the possible vote out there. Yeah. But what's pissing off Trump though
*  is was pissing off his team is that what they're counting are mail-ins and mail-ins are
*  Democrats are way more likely to vote mail-in. Yeah. Right. So that's like,
*  I'm sure I'm telling you something you already know. Yeah. Yeah. That that's his gripe about
*  these things that are laying around. And then I think that he thinks they're just going to start
*  making them up. He tweeted earlier, like he's like, they keep finding Biden votes in all
*  these states. Like, yeah, he's like, someone's going to find 4,000 Biden votes somewhere.
*  Which I don't know. Sure. It's, they also made weird rules in some states where the signature
*  on the envelope does not have to match the actual person's signature. Like when you sign the envelope
*  for a mail-in ballot. Really? I know my midterm ballot got thrown away. Cause it didn't look like
*  your signature. I got a note. I was out of town. I got a call. There was a problem with my ballot.
*  By the time I got back, it was over and I didn't get counted. And did they say why? Yeah. It was
*  like, I didn't sign and date it right or send, didn't sign and date where I was supposed to sign
*  and date. And he, well, I thought I was, I was like quite pleased with democracy. The fact that they
*  tried to call me to rectify the situation, I would have had to like do a bunch of stuff and there'd
*  be no way. I think they probably knew there's no way I have enough time to do everything I need to
*  do. But the fact that some dude would like place a call to be like, bro, your vote's not counting.
*  Wow. You call back or do you got to do X, Y, and Z in a hurry to get your vote in. And I missed.
*  Biden wins Wisconsin. Fox news projects limiting Trump's chances of reaching 270 electoral votes.
*  Wow. So if Biden won Wisconsin, Wisconsin's in. So it's kind of over, right?
*  We'll see how it goes. Hmm. Man, I just lost 300 bucks.
*  It's interesting that Arizona went blue. That's interesting. I mean, California always goes blue.
*  Oregon always goes blue. That all makes sense. Washington, that makes sense. You know, it's funny
*  that what's not happening yet is when we set this date, Joe, we sat here and talked about
*  that America would be on fire as we recorded this. I think they're waiting to find out what the
*  results are. And then then they light the fuse. They can't start the fire yet. They might've won
*  like both sides. Yeah. You know, like the Trump people, they're like, I'm not sure if I'm mad yet.
*  And then, you know, the Biden people, Oh, is he won? What's happening here? No one knows. Once
*  decided, once it goes to court, that's going to be a shit show. Isn't it funny? Like the different
*  way, the different camps, if there is like a court and a dispute, the different camps, like that,
*  the one impulse is to mount a giant flag on your truck and get other dudes in trucks
*  to roar around. But that's only the Trump people. I know what I was saying. Like that's one camp.
*  Yeah. Okay. One camp would be, I have a friend who has a student who has a husband in the military
*  and he described these rolling motorcades as vanilla ices. Why vanilla ices? Because he was,
*  he served and it reminded him of the ISIS flags in the back of trucks. Vanilla ices. That's
*  hilarious. That was his depiction of it. But the other camp is that you, and the other camp,
*  when you're mad, like you go to, like you go to, you march downtown. You know, it's like the two
*  sort of like playbooks, you know, are just very different. Yeah. One's in a car. One's marching.
*  Yeah. Yeah. One's like a display. Yeah. Like I don't think that any, no one that will get,
*  no one is going to get mad about the, like no Biden person will put a big Biden flag on their truck
*  and drive aggressively on a highway. No, here's my take on it. And Trump people aren't going to go
*  downtown. No, they're not going to march. And not without their cars. I wonder what, like who's,
*  what side is in worse shape to march? The Biden people or the Trump people, like who would have
*  like worse backs and fucked up knees? Oh, that's impossible to say. You know, I, like right now,
*  talking about that responsibility thing, man. I write, like, I don't know if you, I feel like
*  you probably don't feel this. I right now, I'm kind of like grieving for America a little bit,
*  not about how the election might twist, but I'm grieving for America about
*  if the polarization is true. And I sometimes question whether it's true or not, because when
*  I go out, I just have like, I've been talking about this all the time lately. When I go out,
*  about in my community and elsewhere, sitting here right now, whatever, I have like very positive
*  interactions with my fellow Americans. When I go to the gas station and go in to buy some shit,
*  it's like, I come away happy. That's most people. When I go talk to my neighbors, who I've like,
*  I legitimately, my neighbors around me, I have no idea who they're voting for. I really don't know.
*  I kind of actually don't care. When I go and talk to my neighbors, there's like a love,
*  right? But then all I hear about is the ripping apart. And I'm like, either I'm in the dark
*  and it's ripping apart and I'm like too stupid to notice it. But I do, like I do,
*  like I'm a little scared. I'm a little scared as well. Did you watch the Social Dilemma on
*  Netflix? We've been in our old people with kids way watching it in 15 minute increments.
*  Like we have a TV in our bedroom, but now and then like when I'm home, we like watch 15 minutes of
*  it on a cell phone. I have no idea why. My 12 year old daughter, this is the dumbest thing I've ever
*  seen. She hated it. We tried to make her watch it because I just wanted her to understand the
*  dangers and dilemmas of social media. But to her, social media is awesome. I like TikTok. She's
*  TikToking and shit and hanging out with her friends. She only sees the positive sides of it.
*  What I was trying to get her to see is like, obviously she has no interest at all in politics.
*  She doesn't understand the division that's happening in this country because
*  people live in these echo chambers and they argue ideas and the way social media exacerbates this
*  with their algorithms that point you towards things that are outrageous, point you towards
*  things that piss you off and keep you in this sort of ideological bubble. And the people are
*  dividing further and further away from each other. And you look at this shift in the way
*  people view the other side, whereas there were so many more people that were sort of centrists or
*  a little bit of ideas from the left, a little bit of ideas from the right. Now it's very divided,
*  very divided. And it's directly correlating with the invention of social media.
*  Yeah. But if the division and hatred is only digital.
*  But it spills out, obviously. It does spill out into the real world. You look at Portland,
*  you look at Seattle. You lived in Seattle for a while. Did you ever have imagined that they
*  would take over a six block area of Seattle? Yes. You really did? You thought they could?
*  I felt like I could definitely see it because when I was there, there was an enormous amount of
*  tension around the homeless crisis in Seattle, that loitering laws, camping laws were just suspended.
*  And they would go into an encampment, like in a whatever, I don't know what you call it. I wish
*  I knew the proper term for them. They'd go into an illegal encampment or whatever and move everybody
*  out, actually scrape the topsoil away because of needles and stuff, whatever, scrape the topsoil
*  away, pull out, and then people would just move back in. And there was a lot of tension about this.
*  And it was that some people were like, why can't we enforce the law? And people being like, well,
*  it's inhumane to people who are in need. And there was an emerging tension there. So to have
*  it later be that you saw that blow up on this grand national scale doesn't surprise me. After
*  seeing that level of just consternation from people who'd been there a long time about why
*  do I have this feeling that there's laws that I'm held to, but some people are just not held to a law.
*  And this is pre-COVID when you were living there. Oh yeah. Yeah. So being witness to that and hearing
*  the amount of griping about that and then seeing it, no, I'm not like, wow, it felt very
*  almost not at all surprising that it happened. Yeah. I think there's places in this country
*  that have legitimate, almost unfixable issues with homeless people. Los Angeles is not one of them.
*  Los Angeles, when I first moved there in 94, was nothing like this. Nothing. There was no tents
*  ever. You never saw tents. Now, my friend sent me a video where she was driving down in Venice
*  and she held her phone up out the window and it is a mile plus of tents, just nothing but tents.
*  It's crazy. Like you look at it, you're looking at thousands of tents. Like this is insane.
*  How do you put the lid on that? How do you get those people out of there? Where do you put them?
*  How do you clean that area up? I mean, it's disgusting. And you're talking about Venice,
*  which is like a very wealthy area. There's a lot of money in Venice. There's a lot of beautiful
*  houses. You're on the beach and they're fucked. It's fucked. I was going to a restaurant there
*  with my wife and we stopped at a red light and there was this beautiful house to the left,
*  probably like millions of dollars, right? To the right, 10 tents, right across the street from
*  their fucking house. Like a small road and then homeless in camp and across the street from this
*  beautiful house. Like what the fuck? And I talked to people that are there and like, no, we have
*  ring, those little ring doorbell things with the videos, constantly seeing people stealing shit,
*  constantly seeing people breaking into their yard, trying to get into their house,
*  wandering in their backyard, trying to get into the garage. It's like, and they, there's no solutions.
*  The government doesn't do a goddamn thing about it. Yeah, I've got input on all kinds of things,
*  but I'm like low on input on that. I have zero. We did our company, we did a river,
*  like a river access park cleanup, went and picked up all kinds of garbage at a river access near
*  our, near where we work. And there was a homeless encampment there in the woods at the river access.
*  I remember being like very, I was kind of scared because I was like, it's super rude
*  to go and like pick up garbage and just sort of like act like there aren't people camp there.
*  And not acknowledge these human beings. Like you wouldn't, you know, if there was people that are
*  fishing or people that are having a picnic, you would engage. So I'm like, why do I feel like
*  chicken shit about engaging? So then I go up and like, guys, I know it's gonna seem like we're
*  kind of like up in your business. We're doing a cleanup project, just bagging up garbage and
*  hauling away. Dude's like, Hey, give us a couple of bags. So they take some bags, fill up some
*  garbage, set it on the trail. We hauled away. And like for a week, I'd been like plotting how I'm
*  gonna. And it was easy. It's just like, it was just, yeah, we have this. It was like, it was like,
*  I heard there's this writer, Jeff, Jeff Dyer, he wrote this book, Yoga for People Who Can't Be
*  Bothered Do It. Jeff Dyer, he was a humorist. I remember he had this essay he wrote about
*  struggling with his desire to witness great poverty. When he would travel, he's a professional
*  traveler, you know, and you'd go to India and he would, he struggled with why do I want to go?
*  Like, is it bad? Like, what is it that I want to go witness? Behold the spectacle of poverty.
*  You know, instead of like most people don't put that in their travel itinerary.
*  So he would specifically do that on purpose? Yeah. He talks about his book. Why do I like,
*  like, it was kind of like, why do I like that? It's definitely a perspective changer,
*  right? You start thinking you have problems and you go see people with real problems,
*  you're like, whoa, okay. Yeah. Yeah. But homeless people in this country,
*  it used to be a different thing, you know, it used to be all people that were drug addicts
*  or all people that were mentally ill. But I think with COVID, you've got people that just had nowhere
*  else to go. There's a lot of people that they might be homeless right now, but they don't want
*  to be. They just don't know what to do. I think that number is bigger than it's ever been before.
*  And that's what makes it even scarier. And that's one of the reasons why something like universal
*  basic income is interesting to me. You know, I'm not interested in letting the government
*  take our taxes and do things to, like, you don't get a receipt for where your taxes go,
*  right? You don't know how much your taxes are going to frivolous things or things that don't
*  make any sense or things you don't agree with. But if I knew that my taxes were going to very
*  specific things that I agree with, I wouldn't have a problem paying more taxes. You remember Ross
*  Perot, he used to make those little charts showing where your money went. Scared the shit out of
*  everybody. He's the reason why Bush didn't win a second term, Herbert Walker Bush. That was the
*  first time, unless Trump loses, in modern history where a president didn't win a second term. The
*  first time, well, Carter and then Herbert Walker Bush. Because they saw that Ross Perot thing,
*  he bought a half hour of regular television. Back when there was no internet, he was like,
*  I'm going to show you what's going on here. Here, look at this chart. This is where your
*  goddamn money goes. And he was telling people like, what the fuck? Like, he opened up a lot
*  of people's eyes to what the IRS is and where your money goes and why it's dirty. Scared the
*  shit out of people. It's a weird time to be alive, Steve. I'm not, I'm worried about the
*  future of this country too. I'm worried about it in a way that I've never been worried before.
*  Yeah, I like, I just like like America so much. I was having a conversation with someone recently
*  where they were kind of like challenging why, challenging why you could be, why you could feel
*  proud about being in a, like a citizen of a country where you just were born there and you just live
*  there because you were born there. It's like, how can you be proud of that? You were just born there.
*  Right. I'm like, man, I can't really suss it out, but I feel like I have like a sort of
*  like a sense of pride and patriotism and to, and so I like worry about the country in a way,
*  like what it feels like for people. Like I worry about like what it feels like for people to be
*  American. And knowing that there are people at a point that are even challenging the idea of
*  taking pride in that, like that's a sign of something bad. And also people who conversely
*  are taking their deep sense of pride and love and using it to leverage and diminish
*  other people. A sort of like, I love it more or I have more of a right to love it. And like even
*  like the fact that to either lack patriotism or conversely to weaponize patriotism, it all makes
*  me feel like a little, like I'm a little skittish right now, man. Right. I know what you're saying.
*  I want to know if there's a, this is true. Cause someone was saying that Google and Facebook
*  both remove the ability to have an American flag emoji. That cannot be true.
*  I don't know. I just read it. Just Google that. That's just, I don't know. Just Google that
*  Google, like if you want to leave a comment to have a American flag emoji. Yeah. Like
*  like you put a series of American flags and thumbs up. Yeah, exactly. Come on. Can't do
*  that anymore. I don't do it. I don't know if it's, I literally don't know if it's true. I read it and
*  I was like, what? I was running out the door. I was like, what? Um, look, I get where people would
*  say you had no say in being American. Why would you be proud of that? You should be proud of things
*  you've accomplished. You should be proud of things you worked hard towards, but what America stands
*  for, I feel super lucky to be an American. I think America stands for an incredible amount of
*  innovation, incredible contribution to music and art and comedy. And just, uh, just, uh, the overall
*  impact that it's had on the culture of the world for a country that's just a little over 200 years
*  old is phenomenal. It's insane. I mean, I think, I think this is the greatest experiment in self
*  government and then getting a bunch of people to live together and then what, what kind of impact
*  it has on the rest of the world ever. I mean, it's, it's an amazing place to be. I had a
*  conversation. Oh, sorry. I was going to say, I just think right now people are concentrating
*  only on the negative aspects. I had a conversation recently with someone who'd built over the course
*  of their life, they'd built a billion dollar business and highly critical of the government,
*  highly critical of the government while simultaneously building a billion dollar
*  business telling me he feels no patriotism. I'm like, fucking you don't feel any patriotism,
*  dude. You can't really do it. You've hacked on your, you've hacked on the government the whole
*  time and built a successful business. You don't think there's a little magic in that. Yeah.
*  That to be in a place where that can go down. Well, that's pretty cool. The government's not
*  ideal. No, but it's pretty cool to be able to, like, I'd be, you know, I just feel like you'd be
*  like, man, this place is so great. I hacked on the government my whole career and made a bunch of
*  money and no one shows up to beat me up. Did that in China. You'd be dead. Yeah. Damn it.
*  There's places in, yeah, there's places in the world right now, or if you did the exact same
*  thing, they'd literally come for you and kill you. You know, we were talking yesterday on the podcast
*  about this wrestler in Iran that is a world champion wrestler who they executed because he
*  participated in a peaceful protest and the UFC tried to plea, make a plea to the Iranian government
*  to not kill him and they fucking killed him anyway. They wanted to send a nice message. This guy was
*  a national sports hero and they want to send a nice message. We don't give a fuck what you are.
*  You are, you are under us. Yeah. We are a powerful theocracy and we'll fucking kill you. And they did.
*  Yeah. Yeah, that's happening right now. That's 2020 somewhere else, you know, as bad as it is
*  here and it is, it's not ideal. The government's not ideal. It's not, this is not perfect.
*  We can get an old man who can't talk and another guy who's full of shit and they're the only people
*  that we have to choose from. No, that's not good. That's not good. You know, and then there are
*  other choices. I voted for Joe Jorgensen. I voted for the libertarian candidate, even though I knew
*  she wasn't going to win. I mean, I voted for her in California where she had no chances.
*  Yeah, I think that that's a, that's a very, I'm interested to hear you do that. I had an
*  astonishingly, astonishingly similar thought process as I filled out my ballot is to live in
*  an estate where there's not any question about where it's going to go and to try to support,
*  not necessarily like the libertarian party, but to try to support the idea that you'd have a
*  viable third party of some sort. That it doesn't just happen. It doesn't have to fall into this,
*  this crazy system of, of like this, like this, like collection of thoughts and this other
*  collection of thoughts and you pick between those two. That's it. That's all you got. So any,
*  I thought that like any effort you could lend to the idea of a third seat at the table would,
*  however, you know, you're pissing into the wind still, man.
*  Yeah. You have those two, two schools of thought and these two schools of thought are both funded
*  by the same fucking people. I mean, that's, that's what's hilarious about it all. They're
*  all funded by gigantic businesses. It's not ideal. It's not good. And the, the idea of a third party
*  candidate gets mocked. I mean, all the way back to Ross Perot, just no one, I mean, he's about as
*  close as anyway has come. You know, he at least took some votes away from, I don't think Gary
*  Johnson. I voted for him too. Gary Johnson didn't put a dent in it. He, you know, he barely had a
*  chance and I don't think Joe did either, but it's one of those things where you, you gotta,
*  you gotta look at it and go, do you agree with this system? No. Do you just keep going,
*  keep going with it every four years? Well, if you know, four years is eight and then 12 and then
*  next thing you know, you're dead. It's over. You only get a hundred, right? If you're real lucky
*  and you're not even voting for most of those, like when you get to the, to the end, like what is,
*  Wendy's step up. Wendy's say, I don't want to participate in this ridiculous duopoly anymore
*  because that's what it is. I mean, and they're both in cahoots with some branch of the media.
*  Like it's, it's gross. And then there's so much money involved and so many people are saddling
*  up to the table and influencing them and whispering their ear and they're making all these
*  compromising deals. And I like, do you think about how long you have left on the planet?
*  I think you should. Yeah. Yeah. I wake up. I try to think about that every day.
*  You know, all like politicians, they'll enter office and I'll make a clock set for like four
*  years or whatever and it counts down. I need to get one of those like for life, for like roughly
*  my life expectancy counts down backwards. Well, don't you think that your life expectancy, I mean,
*  you are one of the few people that I know that has almost been killed by a grizzly bear.
*  Well, yeah, that's well, um, you had a real, like in a brush. Yeah. And, uh, uh,
*  something enough where it was scary enough that I now, now that I've studied it a fair bit,
*  that I now know I had, um, I had a mental, I had, I had a, I had like a, like a near death experience
*  mental, a near death experience, mental experience, even though I was unharmed,
*  but, but it jarred my brain so hard. It jarred my, the, the, the, the, the minute or the seconds
*  that occurred jarred my brain so hard that as I studied, as I've tried to be curious about and
*  study about what happened in my brain, um, it's parallels are all found and it's discussed by
*  people who discuss near death experiences, which might just mean I'm not like I'm mentally not that
*  I'm not as tenacious mentally as I'd like to be, but I, my brain got juggled. But don't you think
*  that it's juggled the word. There's no, don't you think that when you're in contact with an animal
*  that's that large, I mean a predatory animal that's how big was it? 10 feet. How big was it?
*  Easily? Yeah, I don't want to, I mean, like it was like struck all of us and we've looked at a lot
*  of bears as being like, you know, a mature brown bear. Okay. So mature cardiac brown bear. Yeah.
*  That's what we wanted to talk about. Talk about where you were at a Fog Knack Island, which is
*  a place that has enormous bears. That whole part of the world is known for some of the largest
*  brown bears on earth. Yeah. It's, I mean, it's, it's separated from Kodiak by a narrow straight.
*  It's like, so like the Kodiak brown bear being like the world's biggest barrels is a neighboring
*  island, but that specific specimen, you know, I don't know, a mature animal, just huge, just huge.
*  When you're around something like that, where there can be no doubt that you can't get out of the way,
*  you can't, you can't fight it off. You can't, you're, you're helpless. Like it must trigger
*  something in your, your mind where you, you, you come to grips with the reality of predator and
*  prey that you almost were on the menu. Yeah. Like there's just no way around that you can't,
*  there's no, there's no rationalizations you can play in your mind when you're confronted with such
*  absolute superiority. Are you familiar with the term playing possum? Yeah. Obviously. So
*  our understanding of a possums now is that they're not playing.
*  They conk out, right? Yeah. Yeah. Stress. He's not playing dead. He hits such an, like he hits such
*  a stress level that he shuts off. I'm like embarrassed to admit, but I think it's instructive
*  to point out that I was playing possum in that moment and I don't mean playing.
*  Yeah. It like, it possum me out. Let's tell everybody who doesn't know the story. Oh yeah.
*  So real quick, Fogknack Island. Yeah. We've been yapping a long time, but we had, we were hunting
*  it had hung a elk up in a tree and left it for a day and a half, all the meat hanging in a tree.
*  Then we're camped a few miles away from there and went back to retrieve,
*  went back with a few guys to retrieve the meat out of the tree and a bear had found it.
*  And we were very, very aware that this might occur and went up and investigated the area around the
*  tree and determined that a bear hadn't found it yet. In fact, that the carcass of the animals
*  laying out far away, it was untouched. In hindsight, there was a pile of bear shit that
*  had been smeared on the ground. And I remember looking at that pile of bear shit and I'm wondering
*  if it had been smeared by a bear's foot or smeared by a boot. And I determined that it looked like
*  it had been smeared by a boot, which would have meant we'd smeared the shit when we were hanging
*  the thing in the tree. And then stupidly we like sat down and eat lunch. And within a couple of
*  minutes of sitting down and eat lunch, the bear came in and it's open mouth passed just 18 inches
*  from my head. And I was facing away so I was the last one to see it. Jan is who you know,
*  but he had a pistol, he had bear spray, but he hit it in the head with a pair of black diamond
*  trekking poles. He had sat down, he's got spray and set his pistol on his pack.
*  But then when I talk about like playing possum and all the shit that happens there,
*  his instinct is to smack it with a trekking pole. Wow. Everything. You spend all your time
*  thinking about how you're going to handle this, that and the other thing.
*  Sometimes it's disappointing that you don't handle stress that well.
*  You know, I just, I don't know. I don't know where I went. One of our guys,
*  I actually got ran over by a bear, rode it down the hill.
*  At that moment, I snapped out of whatever I was in, but I was, it shut me down bad. I even notice,
*  I even notice there's a thing that happens to people when they get really cold.
*  They enter a sort of a self-fulfilling prophecy mentality. When you start to get cold,
*  you lose, as you start to get really cold, like where you get like, where you could be in a
*  hypothermic situation, people stop doing the obvious things that you would do to get warm.
*  And I is aware of that as I am, as many times as I've experienced that, I still see it happen to me.
*  I still have to snap myself out of it. Like you just like, you're getting cold,
*  you're getting lethargic, you're getting cold, more lethargic, the cold's getting worse.
*  And I have to be like, you can stop, you can step in right now and stop this.
*  And I have to remind, it's still, it's like, it still doesn't come naturally.
*  You know, when you talk to people who train, like, you talk to people who train for this kind of
*  stuff, they have to train in a very realistic environment. They have to train to like, keep
*  your head, you know, and just like make good decisions. If you walk into like a active car
*  crash scene or whatever, and there's a severed hand laying on the ground, right? Some people
*  are just going to see that hand and then I can see anything else. Some people are just going to see
*  chaos and they're not going to focus on any particular thing. But it's like the person
*  would come in, see the hand, see everything around them, like assess all that. It's like,
*  it's just from exposure to that super traumatic stuff. Not to get in cold traumatic, but I do,
*  when I look at how I respond to things, I do catch that there's like a mentality to practice and learn.
*  Yeah, it's, it's understandable that something like a bear attack would trigger
*  senses and trigger response that you're just not conditioned for. You're not, I don't know
*  how you'd ever get conditioned to a bear attack. I don't know. I don't know. I mean, I'm not saying
*  Island, these dudes at the same Island, there was some guys, some, uh, the same Island,
*  I think it was later that same year, uh, some operatives, some military guys
*  happened to be hunting there. They got attacked by a bear and killed it.
*  Got one of them got messed up bad, but he killed it. I'm like, why'd he kill it? And I didn't.
*  Well, maybe they had their gun out, right? You were in a weird situation too. Cause if you guys
*  were relaxed eating lunch with your guards down, you're sitting there chewing on a sandwich.
*  I always laugh. Cause you know, I was in the middle of saying what, like I was in the middle
*  of a sentence. I'll never forget because someone was laughing about why we were putting some
*  sandwiches together and someone was laughing about why my sandwich looks so much nicer than
*  someone else's sandwich. And I said, if you want, I was in the middle of saying, if you want a
*  sandwich like this, get your own fucking TV show, but I was never able to finish the sentence.
*  But I know I was in the middle of saying that when all of a sudden the people around me erupted
*  off the ground, uh, as though like a landmine had gone off underneath us. Cause they saw it and I
*  didn't see it. I was like, no way. And it came in running. Oh, yeah. That was scary, man. And I've,
*  I've had like, you know, fair bit, fair bit of exposure. Um, and then I'm, yeah, like,
*  I mean, relative to most, a ton of exposure to those things. I got to expose my 10 year old
*  kid to them this year, a couple of times, you know, um, hunting caribou in Alaska. And it was,
*  it was, it was like cool to kind of see his thought process.
*  You, yeah, you've been exposed to more than 99.999% of the population. Yeah. And for it to
*  rattle you like that, it was disappointing, man. Cause we're always talking about, I'm going to do
*  this and I'll do that. And we're always like, yeah, you know, I actually prefer the 44 over to three
*  because you know, and if I can't get it done with this 13, you know, I got 13 reasons. He doesn't
*  want to charge me with this semi-auto. It's like all this like bullshit, you know, but all of a
*  sudden it like hits and like, you know, swat it with a track and pull. I've only seen one grizzly
*  ever in the wild, uh, up close and, uh, it wasn't a big one. It was like a six foot bear, but, uh,
*  it looked at me in a way that a, another bear has never looked at me before. I've seen black bears,
*  black bears look at you like, what are you? Who are you? What's going on? Can I walk by you? Like
*  black bears look at people at a weird way. Yeah. They're like denizens of the underbrush, man.
*  The grizzly looked at me like this, just locked on me and I was like, oh shit. Like that is just a
*  different thing. Like it looked at me like, yeah, am I eating you? Am I going to eat you? Yeah.
*  There's a mindset probably that comes from, uh, there's a mindset that probably comes from just
*  not being challenged. Yeah. And where I was at in, uh, Alberta, they, you can't hunt them. So no
*  one hunts them. So they're, they're bigger, they're more fierce and they have no pressure.
*  You can still in Alberta. Can you? Yeah. BC you can't anymore. BC you can't, but you can
*  hunt grizzlies in Alberta. Yeah. I think, I think Albert, I'm not, not, I'm not saying everywhere,
*  but I know that they still, I believe that Alberta still has it. BC lost it's BC lost
*  is grizzly hunts. This is my friends, John and Jen Rivet. They were talking about how they're
*  trying to get them to open up some sort of a season because they have a lot of them up there
*  now. Oh, okay. And because the, the woods are so dense, they don't really know how many of
*  them there are, but there's so many encounters with people. Yeah. The, the BC shutdown was very,
*  it was political, right? It was very, yeah. It was like, it was a referendum issue. Yeah. That's
*  a weird one, right? Because the people that are making that decision, they've never had any
*  experience with bears, but you talk to the people that actually live in the bush and they'll tell
*  you that there's a lot of grizzlies up there. And then there was also a thriving business and
*  industry of people that were guiding up there and you know, they're constantly in contact with them
*  and they're like, you know, this is not, this is not an endangered animal. Yeah. People that live
*  in proximity to like people that live in proximity to things that are regarded as endangered tend to
*  have, tend to have a different perspective on the abundance than people who look at it from far away.
*  This is a good time to find this out. What happened in Colorado with the wolves? Oh, I mean,
*  they had to have, did it pass? Jamie could pull it up. They had to have passed overwhelmingly.
*  Yeah. I know it was on track to, I know that Utah's right to hunt and fish passed by a landslide,
*  constitutional right to hunt and fish. What does that mean? Um, 30 some states have it now.
*  They're just like codifying that you have a right to hunt and fish and it doesn't usually have teeth
*  but it might in the future just give away to challenge laws. It's, it's being used right now
*  in like Montana has a right to hunt and fish. Okay. You have a constitutional right to hunt and fish,
*  meaning that, um, that, you know, a state has to recognize that renewable resources can be like,
*  should be allocated to hunters and anglers. Um, and it's, and you might ask like, well,
*  how does it ever come into fruition? There are, there's a lawsuit right now in, in Montana,
*  there's a lawsuit against the governor and the state who they put a cap, they put a quota on the
*  wolf harvest and they're being sued by a conservation group who's worried about the
*  steep decline in elk numbers. They're being sued by that conservation group that their right to
*  hunt is being infringed upon by a reticence to control wolf numbers to the detriment of big
*  game herds. People are usually, I think people are supposed to act like apologetic for the fact
*  that they want wild game resources. Like it's like, Oh, you know, um, we talked about this one
*  individual that you were curious about who is very instrumental in Wolf reintroductions and he
*  refers to hunters as the recreational big game killing industry. And it's kind of like a, a
*  swipe at people who sort of acting like it's not a legitimate perspective to want there to be
*  deer, elk, moose, caribou to eat and use. I'm like very unapologetic about my view that I want there
*  to be a lot of deer, elk, whatever game. What's most of your food, right? Yeah. I want like,
*  I want that to be on the landscape. I want there to be abundant amounts of that. And I don't,
*  I'm not bashful about the fact that my desires there, um, influence my feelings about predator
*  management. Like I don't view it as that bad. Uh, wolves kill coyotes competition. Yeah. Yeah.
*  Let's see here pass. It says it's too close to call it's up 10,000. No,
*  shoot. Wow. To that. Wow, man. They were, I think they were predicting that was a done deal. Holy
*  shit. Now that to be clear, that is just that proposition one one four in Colorado is, is
*  they're saying restore great Grails. What it is, is making that the state fishing game agency
*  will need to craft a plan. There's still a lot. It's not like, it's not like that passes and all
*  of a sudden here comes a helicopter full of wolves. It, it doesn't go that way. They have to craft a
*  plan. Then that plan has to be approved. Yeah. It'll be, and it'll be like, you can imagine it'll
*  be like all kinds of lawsuits, all kinds of issues, a lot to be sussed out, but it'll, it's forcing the
*  state game agency to craft a plan and take seriously what it would look like. Like there's,
*  cause the argument is like, Oh, you're making it a popular vote. You're taking science out of the
*  hands of scientists and putting it in the hands of the public. But in all fairness, I hope it
*  doesn't pass because wolves are showing up in Colorado on their own. I think that's a better
*  way to go. But yeah, I think it's like less social tensions. It'll happen slower. It'll be like a,
*  you'll kind of like generate a sort of different sort of wolf that way. So I hope it doesn't pass.
*  What do you mean by that? Generate a different sort of wolf?
*  I mean that wolves that this is a little bit, it's a little bit fuzzy, but it's like when wolves,
*  when we established wolf seasons in Montana, wolf hunting seasons and trapping seasons in Montana
*  and Wyoming and Idaho after a long period where there weren't a wolf season, it had a really
*  dramatic impact on how the wolves behaved. It made them much more secretive, moved them into
*  different areas, kind of pushed them out of some of the bigger riparian zones. It just sort of
*  changed their attitude, changed the way they interact with the landscape. So that you're
*  getting, it might be true that by having wolves that have this instinct of they're already coming
*  out of the greater Yellowstone ecosystem, passing down through the Southern Wyoming and going to
*  Colorado, they might have kind of a, they might have developed a finer tuned instinct about
*  avoiding trouble with people. Cause there's like a lot of selective pressure against wolves and
*  against grizzlies, a lot of selective pressure against those that are too ready to engage with
*  man. It's like a good way to end up dead when you engage with man and spend too much time around
*  livestock, spend too many time around developments. It's like, it doesn't work out for those ones,
*  the ones that shy away from and avoid habitations, avoid livestock. Like that's the, that mentality
*  in a wolf gets rewarded. So it could be that if we're headed down a path where it's, it's
*  just gonna happen, that Colorado is going to have wolves. And I'll say like, absolutely it's going
*  to happen because it happened. They showed up on their own. How many, did they know what the numbers
*  are right now? Just a handful, but they think they're having pups. So it, the people who, the
*  architects of this plan in Colorado would say it's just not going to happen fast enough. They want it to
*  happen real fast. And do they have a specific reason why they wanted to happen faster? They would say
*  that wolves are gone because of human manipulation, because of a very intentional plan to shoot them
*  and poison them off the face of the earth. This was in the 1800s. Yeah. 1800s, 1900s. And that is
*  wrong. That's a sin against nature and that we have an obligation to rectify that crime, that sin,
*  and bring this animal back. Their enthusiasms don't extend to all sorts of imperiled wildlife,
*  but this is a highly, to them, a very symbolic one. It's very symbolic. People, you know, the
*  black, like why they don't have those passions around the black-footed ferret, I don't know.
*  I don't love black-footed ferrets. They don't feel that way about black-footed ferrets.
*  But with wolves, it's like, it means a lot to them. I think also that is a,
*  bringing wolves in is a little, it's like also, no one's ever going to tell you this. I have a
*  suspicion that I have a personal theory that it's a kind of a way to sort of stick it to,
*  it's kind of a way to stick it to cattle producers. It's kind of a way to stick it to
*  hunters. There's a little bit of that that infuses it, a little bit of a cultural antagonism.
*  That itch isn't scratched with black-footed ferret work like it is with wolves. It's just symbolic.
*  So you think they, so are they like vegetarians? They want to stick it to cattle producers because
*  they don't want people growing cattle? Well, I mean, to speak in very, very general terms,
*  the cattle industry has been historically quite hostile to environmental groups. No, hostile to
*  predators. Right. Hostile to wolves. I'm kind of like, if you could work into my brain on it
*  and sort of like just accept what I'm telling you is kind of a true thing. I do like wolves to be
*  on the landscape. I recognize that there are real problems that come, like real problems for real
*  people that come with wolves. I don't think we should, I don't think we can justifiably play God
*  and eliminate species from the planet. Like that feels very deeply wrong to me. I want wolves to
*  be on the landscape, but if they're going to be on the landscape, we're going to have to set what
*  that looks like and then open up like pressure release valves and pressure release valves will
*  take the form of hunting and trapping. Like state management, there should be a stable population
*  of wolves. We should agree what that population looks like and they should be managed by the state
*  as a renewable resource. It's like, what I want is pretty clear. I'm not like an anti-wolf person.
*  What I am is an anti-abuse of the Endangered Species Act person. So I'm not anti-predator at all,
*  man. I enjoy seeing them. I enjoy cutting their tracks. Do you see them in Montana a lot?
*  You know, I got friends that see them a lot. I see them only very rarely in glimpses of them.
*  But you can go find them quite easily in certain areas. Like in Yellowstone National Park, you can
*  go find them. They were, people would run like even before the hunting season started, you'd run into
*  them more. I was with Ben O'Brien in BC the first time I met Ben and we found a carcass of a moose
*  calf that had been torn apart by wolves. It was wild. Yeah. It was pretty recent. It was cool to see.
*  The other day we were looking at a brand new, those phonics, we were looking at a brand new
*  track in a big burn area, a brand new track and brand new powder snow in a big burn area.
*  And then looking around, you could feel like you could see everything and the snow was still
*  falling. It was brand new. It's like, why can't I see that thing? And then I talked to a friend
*  of a friend and he was in that same area on that same day and had a couple passing 40 yards of them.
*  So, you know, it happens and it doesn't. Yeah. There's such an iconic animal
*  for the West. You know, I'm glad they're around. I'm glad they exist. I've only seen one in the
*  wild once and that was in Alberta and it was just, it was at dusk. I could barely see it
*  run across the road. I was like, is that a fucking dog? What is that? You know, it was one of those
*  things. Yeah. I saw a black one this year and all the time I saw it, I was wondering if that's what
*  I was seeing. Like the whole time I actually spent looking at it, I was like, is that what I'm seeing?
*  And then it was gone and I was like, oh, that's what I saw. So I never even appreciated, it was
*  so fleeting. I never appreciated the moment. I spent the whole moment in wondering what I was
*  looking at. I had that happen the other day where I was like, oh my God, there's a mountain lion.
*  And I'm like, oh no, it's not. It's the back of a bighorn sheep. I don't know why my head went
*  mountain lion. I saw a squirrel once in Alberta and I thought for a whole second that it was a wolf.
*  Yeah. Is that a wolf? It's a fucking squirrel. I was like, what is wrong with you? But it was
*  just like in between trees and you know, dense forest. I couldn't tell what the fuck I was
*  looking at. The Arctic Explorer, um, the John Lerner Stephenson describes sneaking up on a grizzly
*  bear that was a marmot. And he describes seeing a walrus's head sticking out of the water
*  and then realizing it was a hill on the land with two white snowshoots coming down these
*  troughs in the hillside. It's weird how the mind plays tricks on you like that. Yeah. That's why
*  I don't trust you. Oh, it's a walrus. Oh no, it's not. It's the earth. When people talk about seeing
*  Bigfoot, you know, I ran into one lady when I was doing this Bigfoot show and, uh, up in the
*  up in the Mount Rainier and she was, uh, very adamant that she saw a gorilla. She saw a big
*  gorilla walking through the woods. She's like, I'm looking at it. I'm like, that's a gorilla.
*  And I remember like, wow, this lady's so sincere. I wonder what she really saw. But now I'm convinced
*  she saw a black bear that was standing on two feet. But I bet in her mind, I'm thinking about
*  me seeing that stupid squirrel thinking it's a wolf. People, your brain plays little tricks on you
*  and then your imagination fills in the blanks. There are these online forms. People have found
*  three Bigfoots on our TV show because they don't realize that people are always like
*  ducking to get out of a shot. It's hilarious. So someone might like whatever, someone might be
*  doing something and like realize all, you know, and they duck into a brush and lay down and people
*  are like, oh yeah, if you go to this moment in this second, you'll see it. They don't even know
*  it's there. The guys don't even know it's there, but you can see it in the bushes.
*  People love to find missing things. Things that aren't real. You know, I've always said this,
*  that like if Bigfoot was a hundred percent real, if everybody knew there was Bigfoot,
*  it wouldn't be nearly as interesting as Orcas. Like if Orcas weren't real, like if Orcas were
*  a legend, like the people have seen this thing, it's in the water, it's intelligent and it's
*  enormous and they can sing and they have different languages and dialects and they might be aliens.
*  They might be from another planet. Apparently they don't even hurt people. They help people,
*  fall off boats and they actually rescue them. And these are all things that people have said about
*  killer whales. But because we know killer whales are real, you seem like, oh look, you can put
*  them in a fucking swimming pool and stick them in a parking lot in San Diego and people come to see
*  them and they think it's cool. My kids, they have a lot of, we get them a lot of animal books
*  and they like the dinosaur books, especially the ones where there's like always a picture of a
*  dinosaur than a person. Relative, right? So you get a relative size sense. I find myself,
*  I probably have a hundred times to my children said, that's all, that dinosaur book is great.
*  Dinosaurs are great. The biggest thing to ever live on the face of the earth is alive right now.
*  The biggest thing ever is alive right now. And they're just like, yeah, T-Rex, man, that's a,
*  I'm like, are you listening to me? The biggest creature ever is now, now. And they're like, man,
*  if I could only visit the dinosaur. Like a shark, imagine if a shark wasn't real, you know? But then,
*  you know, you could see one or they thought a shark was extinct. Like everyone cares about
*  Megalodon. Oh my God, they think they might've found a Megalodon. Megalodons might still be alive,
*  but nobody cares about a great white. Like that's alive for sure. There's a lot of them.
*  They fucking breed up in San Francisco. You go in the water, they find them. There's this video,
*  there's an amazing video of drone footage off of Malibu. And these guys are surfing.
*  And you follow the drone footage, just a couple hundred yards from the servers. And you see a
*  great white swimming through the water. Just right past these people. It's like, Jesus Christ.
*  I was looking at this radio tracking shit of a great white on the East Coast.
*  I think it'd be like hanging around the coast, you know, and also like B lines for Bermuda.
*  Hangs around there, B lines back where it came from. Just like, yeah, I think I'll go over
*  a thousand miles over this away. Yeah. They're incredible, man. Yeah, they're amazing. And
*  they're real. And no one gives a shit. They care if they see it. If you see it, like, whoa.
*  But it's where animals are native and non-native. It's such a strange conversation. I really enjoyed
*  your episode that you did with Jesse Griffiths, where you were hunting Neil Guy,
*  which is Texas, where we are now is a weird place. Yeah. My wife saw an Axis deer the other day.
*  She's like near our house. She's like, I saw this deer. It was like a full-sized deer, but it had
*  spots like a fawn. And I go up as an Axis deer. She's like, they have those here? I'm like,
*  they must. They have everything. They have. We're laughing driving down the road. Oh, a zebra.
*  Could easily be a zebra. No, I'm not kidding. Like, we're like, oh, a zebra. Yeah. You saw a zebra.
*  And not only that, but a free range zebra, wild zebra, like low. Yeah. I don't know that the one
*  I'm talking about. I don't know. I would imagine that happens to some amount of them, like get away
*  here and there, but. Where us, it was just wide open, like woods in between houses. There was an
*  Axis deer. Yeah. The zebra I'm talking about was like someone's zebra, but it's still just funny.
*  Like the climate supports it. Oh yeah. Yeah. So these Neil guy, I mean, you know.
*  They're from India? An antelope from, you know, Indian subcontinent. Such a cool looking animal.
*  Yeah. That's strange. Jesse's restaurant here in Austin, man. I mean, he serves it. Yeah. Shout
*  out to Dai Douai. It's a great place. You know, a dog on them about the name of that all the time.
*  It's, but it like comes from like this, you'll have to explain to you, but it's Italian for something.
*  Yeah. It's like to eat from the both the kingdoms. It's something it's some, he kind of regrets name
*  in his place that, but, uh, cause it's always like, you know, no, no, no, pronounce it. But it's like,
*  eat from the kingdom of the land and kingdom. It's some portion of this sort of like proverby
*  thing saying like, eat from the land, eat from the sea, which isn't, which isn't bad advice.
*  Is he fully open now? Cause when I went there, he just had the patio. I don't believe so. I
*  believe it's some kind of limited situation. Yeah. Austin's interesting. Like some places are just
*  open. Yeah. It's like wear a mask, come on in. And then other places like his place is a little
*  bit more protective. He, um, like yourself, he's a, uh, exceedingly generous person.
*  Jesse is good. Remember talking all that shit about America, good American.
*  Yeah. He seems like a real nice guy. Like I've only met him once, but, uh, his restaurants
*  amazing. What does Neil guy tastes like? Uh, you know, it's kind of funny the way, uh,
*  describing wild game goes. I think that, that it was described to me by people who are down there.
*  Um, we were on a ranch called famous ranch called Eteria. It's very limited access, but just through
*  social connections and things. We're able to hunt on this property that doesn't get hunted very
*  heavily. And, um, the people there that have grown up on, you know, on that property, grown up in
*  cattle ranching, they view it as, um, they view it as superior to beef, meaning like Neil guy are
*  for eating cattle or for selling is the way someone explained to me, I mean, because there's like a
*  great monetary value. It is like a market for cattle. There's a market for Neil guy too, but
*  it's different and more complicated, but it was like, it was like, this is what we eat. We eat the
*  Neil guy. Um, we sell the cattle. I mean, like, so it's, it's approachable, mild reminiscent of beef,
*  you know, it's very, very popular. It was very popular. There's a handful of things in the U S
*  where, uh, we have filmed and talked about seek a deer a lot and, and the, and Maryland or Delmarva
*  peninsula. Um, people in those areas is popular as white tail deer are. It's like America's deer,
*  America's meat. Um, people in those areas like screw that man. I'm eating seeker deer. And with
*  people that have exposure to access to your field that way, and people have exposure to Neil guy
*  are like, that's my animal. So it's, it's in that it's, it's in that collection of, yeah,
*  they're insane, man. I got that hide tanned by a guy here, a guy here in Austin ran the process for
*  me, got it tanned and my daughter wanted it for her bedroom. Then there was some kind of custody
*  battle and wound up in my boy's look at that picture. That looks like something from a Dr.
*  Seuss book that doesn't look like a real animal. The one on the right, the big picture, that's
*  crazy, man. Um, aren't there vitals in a weird place too? Very far, very far forward. So you,
*  you almost low and low and forward and how far do the lungs go back?
*  What do you mean the limbs go back lungs? Oh, lungs. Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, not as far as if you're
*  accustomed to not as far back as if you're accustomed to deer. Yeah. You actually, you
*  got to aim like weirdly forward and weirdly low. I shot one and shot the top of the heart off it,
*  but I was aiming like I was under instruction from a person, a guide that we were with. Um,
*  and he was like imploring me, like you have to listen to me. Like it has to go this way or you'll
*  lose that thing in the brush. Wow. Yeah. He said, when they make it into the brush, man, you get a
*  sinking feeling. They like, don't go down easy. I shot it twice. He's like, shoot it again,
*  shoot it again. I'm like, really? I feel like I shot it again, but they're worried about losing
*  the strong, strong animals. Um, but yeah, man, they run most of them around private land.
*  There are public hunting options, opportunities for them. Is that a, an animal that gets hunted
*  by tigers in its natural environment? I believe so. I believe so, but I have no, I have zero
*  expertise on that. That's the thing about access deer. Apparently it was explained to me that they
*  do the, in their natural habitat, they do get hunted by tigers. So they're so fucking fast.
*  They're equipped to deal with it. Have you hunted access? Yeah. How fast are they fast?
*  They're so fast. But I didn't, I haven't hunted them with a bow where you're really, really,
*  where it really comes to haunt you. Leopards play. Leopards. Yeah. Leopards prey. There's no other
*  thing like, you know, with American pronghorn or what we popularly call antelope, um,
*  they're ridiculously fast for anything they have to deal with. And it was like, they, you know,
*  the theory is they, they co-evolve with the American cheetah. Yeah. And now you look like,
*  why does he need to be that like, he doesn't have any reason to be that fast. Yeah. I gotta get a
*  hold of, uh, Dan Flores again. Yeah. I had him on years ago to talk about his book, American Coyote
*  and, uh, lost contact with him. Are you still talking to him? Man, I haven't, but I feel as
*  though if I reached out to him, he would be as, uh, as warm and inviting as he always is. He's a
*  great guy. He's an intellect man. Very, very interesting person. He was, um, when I was in
*  graduate school, I had to take like a out of discipline seminar or something like that. And
*  I took his, uh, I took his, his history writing, Western history, whatever the hell class I took
*  of his and he kicked my ass, you know, kicked my ass. It was very hard class to take. And I learned
*  a tremendous amount from that guy. He was a good professor. I want to get him together with someone
*  like, um, Randall Carlson, who's an expert in the younger dryest, uh, impact theory. Yeah. Cause the
*  two of them coincide like the, the, uh, mass extinction of North American mammals coincide
*  timeline wise with the younger dryest impact theory. So, you know, Randall Carlson spent his
*  entire life focusing on this impact theory and how it ended the ice age. People talk about it being
*  like the idea that never dies. I was at the Linden Meyer site in Colorado of a famous Folsom site,
*  ice age encampment. And I was, it was funny cause I was, I happened to be at that site that there
*  was a guy there working in these certain sediment levels to find these little micro crystals, these,
*  these like these things that were created during the impact. Cause you had all this
*  radiocarbon dating that had been done around Linden Meyer. So we knew all these ages and he
*  was in there looking for these things. And the anthropologists that I was with were very dismissive
*  of him. It was like, ah, you know, but they're less and less so now. Well, yeah, well, they're
*  very invested. They're like, we, I did an interview with a guy not too long ago and we were talking
*  about scientists. Oh, it was a entomologist, uh, Justin Schmidt. I think it was, we're talking about,
*  um, like why do young scientists always make all the discoveries? Not all, but you know,
*  the good idea, like some of the good ideas come from young scientists. He said, cause people my
*  age, all we do is defend our old shit. We're so busy, like we're so busy defending our old theories.
*  Well, so many people in the anthropology side want to, uh, employ the blitzkrieg theory,
*  right? Which is no, it's that at this point it's dead or dead. Really? Remember when I talked
*  about, I got an opportunity to revise my book after 10 years. Yeah. Yeah. I put some language
*  in there around the blitzkrieg hypothesis. So what's the replacement theory? Well,
*  let's explain the blitzkrieg theory. Yeah. The blitzkrieg hypothesis held that, um,
*  that it was the arrival of humans that led to the extirpation and extinction of a lot of the ice
*  age megafauna. So you'd look and, and, and it would be that why did mammoths go extinct in Europe? You
*  know, 30, 40,000 years ago, but they went extinct here 10,000 years ago. Um, and you didn't map like
*  human migrations and you found this kind of like compelling pattern of the fact that people show
*  up and shit goes extinct. Part, we did, we did a podcast about this with a guy you should talk to
*  sometime named David Meltzer, who knows this world better than anybody. Um, and it's really elegant.
*  It's a very elegant theory. It explains a lot very quickly. It's seductive because I think it's
*  seductive from a cultural perspective because it allows you to fantasize that past cultures were as
*  destructive as our own, which makes you feel good that they were hunting these things to an extinction
*  back then. So we can't be that bad for driving things to extinction. Now everything about it was
*  very packaged up and had a nice bow on it. Um, what started to eat away at the blitzkrieg hypothesis is
*  that, um, more DNA work on extinct, on remains, like more DNA work on bones
*  and a greater picture of, um, effective population size of these past populations.
*  And you realize that things were in steep decline anyways, things were changing rapidly anyways.
*  Maybe people came in and kind of like did the, the, the accoude gra on some of these things,
*  but it wasn't that they blinked out. They faded out for a long time, but everything, our old
*  perspective of how we used to look at it made everything seem very compressed and very immediate.
*  Um, and so just, it's just gotten like more complicated. It's just gotten more complicated
*  as we understand more that you had, that you had the, the mammoth populations were perhaps
*  collapsing long before people showed up. And also there's the problem gestation period. Yeah.
*  Yeah. There's, that was the idea too, that you could like people coming into a valley, um, and
*  you would kill some females and could have like a, on, on for, for pachyderms, you know, these
*  things are like very low fecundity that you could come in and kill some females and have this, this
*  impact on it. There's also the problem that, um, I remember criticism of people that used to feel
*  this way, the criticism used to be, they called them the bison boys where they had this fantasy
*  of these like roving, highly effective big game hunters. And then people point now to, um, why is
*  there not more evidence of like, why is there such limited evidence of humans killing mastodons and
*  mammoths? Um, mostly, I mean, stuff's just gone, right? It's been a long time ago, but, but that's
*  another thing. Um, when we used to do, uh, and archeology, they would throw everything away,
*  except for the big bones. Uh, they would look for projectile points, look for big bones, everything
*  else would just get washed away in sluice boxes or through sieves, you know, and we weren't looking
*  at the finer picture of like what people ate, what was there. Um, they thought that any association
*  of human artifacts and mammoth remains meant that, well, it could only mean one thing. These people
*  killed those mammoths, you know, uh, sites that are described as kill sites that now, um, people
*  investigate and like, we have no reason to believe this is a kill site. There was a thing
*  that came out of Mexico not long ago where they're like, oh, the, the, all the, it was a big kill site.
*  They even flipped the bones over in order to do this and that to them. And then these analysts
*  come look at like, there is no compelling reason to think that this is a kill site
*  because now like you take a elephant, a dead elephant, dump it on the ground, look at it in a
*  month, look at it a month later, look at it a month later, look at it a month later.
*  What happens to the bones? You know, um, and things that we used to think were kill sites are just
*  not, it's a long time. Something dies. Time goes by, someone goes in camps there. Later, it all
*  gets jumbled up. You find a projectile point in the mammoth bone. Oh my God, he killed it.
*  And then other people were like, well, no, now that we've analyzed it, the 3000 years separated
*  these two occurrences. There's only so much place on the planet. Shit happens in the same place.
*  Time and time and time again. So it's just, it's fallen apart for, for reasons he melts or would
*  describe more eloquently than me. It is fascinating when they're trying to piece together what happened
*  based on some bones and some fossils and based on tools and just whatever evidence that they find in
*  the ground and that they're trying to put together a comprehensive portrait of history through this.
*  What a lot of anthropologists laugh about is that everything unexplained is always like
*  of religious significance. How so? Like, let's say you find a couple of buffalo skulls in a circle,
*  like they're doing a dig and they find some buffalo skulls facing the same way in the circle.
*  Oh, I see what you're saying. It was like a ritual. Yeah, it was ritualistic. Or just,
*  you might be like died there. Yeah. I mean, you know, I might be cutting up deer and my kids come
*  in and do something, line the hooves up in some way, stick them in the snow. Right. Or whatever,
*  things just like freakish, but yeah, like unexplained things are always like ritualistic,
*  symbolic, reread stuff into stuff. But yeah, the blitzkrieg hypothesis, I'm sure there's probably
*  some hanger on, but it's, it's, it's, it's as dead as the mammoths. I used to love it because it was
*  so beautiful, especially because there's stuff like this, like Wrangel Island. That's where the,
*  the woolly mammoths were survived. They lived there till three, 4,000 years ago. And then that's
*  crazy. Why? And then you'd be like, but no one ever showed up there. They didn't get colonized
*  by humans. Yeah. Why did all this big shit go extinct in Australia 40,000 years ago?
*  When people showed up, it's, you gotta have that Meltzer dude on. What's his name? David J Meltzer.
*  He's at Southern Methodist University. Well, I went to visit him. You know, what he showed me is the,
*  the, the, the Folsom type site where they first excavated Folsom bones. I got to hold them
*  and you can see on the skulls. This is no joke. This isn't like us making believe something's true.
*  These are, you know, 12, 13,000 year old bison skulls. And you can see all the cut marks where
*  they cut the tongues out. Wow. Yeah. The knife, you can see the knife work on the bones.
*  Wow. Yeah. He's that dude is that dude is he's sharp, man. He's written a bunch of books about
*  this stuff. He'd kind of blow your mind a little bit. When we were in Nevada, uh, when we went on
*  that mule deer hunt for your show, I found an arrowhead and uh, I lost it. I don't know what
*  the fuck happened. Someone cleaned my office and it disappeared. We were going to talk about putting,
*  yeah, you're supposed to, uh, supposed to leave it there. Put it back. Yeah, I didn't. I was with
*  some anthropologists one time and they were, we were finding sweet shit up in the Brooks range
*  in Alaska and you had to leave it there, man. They'd photograph it and sketch it and stuff and
*  tuck it back into the tuck it back into the seem so crazy. Tuck it back into the tundra. What'd you
*  find? Oh, old stuff. Old stuff. These guys are, um, like what kind of stuff projectile points,
*  big projectile points. Like how old? Well, the guy I was with, he's retired now, a guy named Mike
*  Cuns. He had found a thing called the Mesa site and he had identified like, you know, this is that
*  kind of area. It's like mathematically the most remote area in North America. If you factor in
*  distance and roads and settlements, um, he had found this very prominent Mesa where it wasn't
*  a campsite, but it was just a place that people would sit and wait for game to come by and found
*  hundreds of projectile points up there. Wow. You know, and these things are like ice age
*  projectile points because they had all kinds of radio carbon dates because they built all these
*  fires up there. Um, and so, uh, he, there's, there's a, there's a, he, he did this whole like
*  book type thing about it. It's, it's the academic community accepts it.
*  Uh, the academic consensus is that he's right during the ice age, whatever it was, 12, seven
*  year, 12,000 some odd years ago, whatever the hell it was, 10,700, like some ice age date,
*  people camped up here, made shit loads of projectile points. This guy found them. Um,
*  we were doing a kind of a continuation of that work of mapping out campsites and we would find
*  like unbelievable points, unbelievable points. It just seems so fucked up to what it hasn't been
*  picked over yet. I know, but it seems so fucked up to leave, dude, Tony, man. It was like against
*  every bit of like Michigan elbow grease I've ever had laid up in me. I would fantasize. I would be
*  like, um, I'd be like, you know, you might be leaving that there, but someday I'm going to
*  get me a helicopter. It will be mine. Well, just the idea of holding onto one of those, just put
*  it in your hand and just imagine what it was like when that, that guy used tendons to lace it to a
*  stick. Yeah. Bad dudes. Yeah. To get their food. A lot of know how they didn't know they're bad.
*  They thought they had cool stuff. They're showing each other new shit. Yeah, I know, right? New,
*  new techniques and strategies. They're like, check this out. And they're like, oh, you young guys,
*  you know, they're, yeah, they thought it was sweet. Yeah. Uh, there's a lot of that out here.
*  There's a lot of arrowheads apparently out here on ranches. People find them all the time. Yeah. My
*  friend, uh, Gary Clark Jr. Had a picture on his Instagram page. You probably find Jamie of a perfect
*  arrowhead. He found on this ranch. I mean, it's just perfect. And you just look at that arrowhead
*  and you think, God damn, someone sent that through the lungs of a white tailed deer probably hundreds
*  of years ago. Look at that. Yeah, that's sweet. That's so awesome. Look at that thing. It's perfect.
*  And it looks like someone just made it.
*  Man, time travel. I know. Could you imagine if there was any, ever a time or you could
*  just go to view just to be a fly on the wall of history? Do you know when you think you 20,000
*  years ago, miles city, Montana, specific. Why? I just, cause I just want to see how, um, I'd want
*  to see maybe not 20, whatever the hell it is. I'd want to see how wooly mammoths interacted with
*  that landscape. Wow. Like I'd seen wooly mammoths in that, in their habitat there. Um, at sort of
*  the arrival of the first humans. There's a guy I'm friends with online. I don't know him in real
*  world, but he's contacted me and he's actually sent me some stuff from his site, but he's, uh,
*  the Instagram handle is, uh, the bone yard in Alaska. Um, do you know this guy here? Let me know.
*  Let me see if I could find it. Uh, you found it already. There you go. The bone yard, Alaska.
*  They, they have this site that, um, they found something there once many, many years ago.
*  And since then they've been pulling all these, there's an ice age caribou horn. They've been
*  pulling all these incredible pieces out. I mean, just over and over and over. You see that one
*  picture? You had a bear track. Look at that right next to his foot. That's, is that a black bear
*  or a small grizzly bear? What is that? Well, I'd want to see the front foot better, but the, my,
*  the front foot's back behind his heel. And I can, it looks like a grizzly. Now, if you scroll back
*  to the page, Jamie, you go down, they've had a bunch of like, look at the one, the upper right,
*  upper right hand corner. Oh, there's a forest Gwant on the podcast talking about it. But that, um,
*  yeah, all the tusks they keep finding there. I mean, they've had, it's a treasure trove
*  in this one area and it's not an enormous area. I mean, I think it's only a few acres that they've
*  been excavating and finding all this shit, but it's just a massive amount of dead bones and,
*  and skulls and, and tusks and, and this one area. On my first date with my wife, I took her to the
*  La Brea Tar Pits. She knew what she was getting into. Yeah, man. Yeah. My old stomping grounds.
*  I've never been, but, uh, that's, uh, Oh, you really know. She tells a story where they had like a
*  little miniature bronze of a mammoth and she said, um, Oh, look, a baby man. They must've found a
*  baby man. And I, um, I was like, well, no, actually, you know, that's it. She's like, yeah, no shit.
*  You know, she's like, well, little lady, let me set you straight.
*  That's a specific time. So you would want to see that more than anything else. Yeah. If I could do
*  a second, if I could take a second whack at it, I would go like a second setting, like back to the
*  future part two. I would go to join Daniel Boone on his first trip over the Cumberland gap.
*  Oh, that'd be wild. That'd be my second trip. Didn't they eat wolves?
*  I don't know. I know he's got a great story about a wolf coming into their camp and biting a guy.
*  And what surprised these hunters was that the wolf seemed very intent on one individual
*  and bit this individual. He then later developed hydrophobia
*  in the area. And they were out Jack lighting for deer where they burned pine knots in the front
*  of a boat and drift down rivers to shoot deer. And he had a bout of what they called like hydrophobia
*  and went berserk. He was, he, he had, uh, rabies. Yeah. He had rabies. So hydrophobia is like that
*  fear of water. Like, I don't know what it is that people, you know, freak out, um, had about, had to
*  be restrained, took them home and he died. Wow. Yeah. And that was in his, that was in his social
*  circle. So the wolf had given him rabies when it bit him. Came into a camp, seemed very, what alarmed
*  them was how it seemed so intent on a person and eventually bit that person and killed that guy.
*  Jesus. And then there's another thing that happened to Boone where Boone's, um, Boone's kid was
*  tortured and killed by Indians and, and he was hastily buried and Boone went back to, uh,
*  Boone went back to, to find the bones of his son and the wolves had torn at the body. And Boone,
*  it was a rainstorm. Boone later described how he had lifted his boy out and held him, you know,
*  sobbing and then heard some sounds in the distance. It was some Indians coming and, uh, slipped off
*  into the night. Wow. And you think about like that moment for that guy. Jesus Christ. When he,
*  later in life, he would, uh, go on these long hunting trips, just him and his, uh, him and his slave
*  together. We'd go on like, like they're like old, old men, old buddies or whatever. I don't mean to,
*  I don't mean to say like buddies cause it was like, but they were like, they were like him and a slave
*  would go on these long journeys hunting together, which I think it'd be like a great play.
*  Right. It kind of would be. Oh dude. When I retire, I'm going to work on that.
*  Just imagine being those people, not knowing what was out there, making their way across the country.
*  That's just a type of, uh, mindset. It's a rare individual that I just don't think we grow people
*  like that anymore. No, it's over-observed. It's over-observed, but Lewis and Clark
*  were supposed to keep their eyes out for mammoths. Really?
*  Wow. Yeah. It's like, oh, I'm going to die.
*  Wow. Yeah. It's like, oh, well you're out there, man. There was some consideration.
*  Was there any stories of mammoths? People that had all the bones, all the bones that come out of
*  stuff. Jefferson got really interested in some of these mammoth, the mastodon bones that had come
*  out of some of those licks and was like, Hey man, you know, in addition to all the other shit, like
*  keep your eyes out for a big elephant. It must've been fascinating to see what the wildlife was like
*  before it was molested by modern humans, you know, back in the 16, 1700s. Like,
*  dude, read Russell, read Russell Osborne's journal of a trapper.
*  What year is that from? He was in the late thirties, early forties. He was a meticulous
*  journal keeper. One of the few people that wrote a journal who wasn't full of shit. Yeah. Um,
*  it's a great depiction of what it was like. And he was like, you know, 30 years after
*  the contact in those areas. I think I mentioned this to you before, but like our idea of like
*  pre-contact contact, there's this Elliot West is this historian and he describes how when Lewis
*  and Clark hit the great plains, I'm already told you this, when Lewis and Clark hit the great plains,
*  there were Indians living on the great plains. So here's Lewis and Clark discovering the great
*  plains, right? Right. There were Indians on the great plains who had been to Europe, met the king
*  of France and returned. Yeah. Yeah. At that time. He's like, it is, he has this essay. It's like,
*  I can't remember what it's called, but it's like, it's a muddled history. It is like, you want to
*  put it, you want to put it into like this neat chronology and, um, shit, there were hundreds of
*  years of just touching go of interaction, touching, go interactions, hundreds. You know, we, we, we
*  had this like linear idea about like, you know, that, that all of a sudden we sort of like in
*  this organized fashion went and found these areas, but there's like crazy interplay. I had no idea
*  that anybody from back then from a native American tribe had gone to France, but that sounds insane.
*  Like how did they even get over there? You remember Jim Jarmusch is dead, man. Yes. Yeah. Kind of
*  similar to that. Like people would be brought like, as like, like, you know, delegations, you know,
*  like we'd be trying to manipulate the governments, France, Spain, England, you know, would be
*  trying to manipulate tribes to participate and form alliances. And you know, that you would,
*  that the, that the, you know, let's say the French might ally with, with a group and that group would
*  stop the bleed of, of, of English colonists pushing into the, you know, Appalachians. And there's all
*  these just, and it was, you know, it wasn't a lot of it was self-serving too. Like, you know, the
*  tribes, absolutely. It was like, they weren't capable of making these decisions for themselves.
*  They got on board with these plans, but yeah, they were whining and dying and man to be like,
*  you know, we're happy to join forces with you. Come to see my palace.
*  It's funny because we're in such a historic time right now, but we're in the middle of it.
*  You know, one day they're going to look back on these days post this crazy election.
*  When people are jockeying for position, who's going to be able to control.
*  Oh, they'll be like, fucking podcasts. Joe Rogan.
*  I'm sure that's gonna have a weird, Joe Rogan had ruined it all.
*  Yeah. Or not. Or not. But they're going to be looking back at this time,
*  but what a chaotic time it is. I mean, this is, this is a history time. Like when, when people in
*  the future going over the 21st century and all the different turns and trials and tribulations,
*  this is going to be a pivotal moment. We, um, what's this Jamie? Oh, there you go.
*  1725 group of Indians, including one. How do you say that? Ato and Osage.
*  Osage. Osage at one Missouri chief, one Missouri young woman, one Illinois, one Chicago.
*  How do you say that? Chicago you? Oh, Chicago. I have no idea.
*  I don't know the pronunciation. And one, uh,
*  Metchegamias were sent to Paris, France. There they met with the director of the company of the
*  Indies and the Duke and the Duchess of de Bourbon. The chiefs were given a complete French outfit,
*  which included a blue dress coat, silver ornaments, and a plumed hat trimmed in silver.
*  They are presented to King Louis XV and they performed a dance at the opera. The French king
*  gave each of the chiefs a Royal medallion, a rifle, a sword, and a watch. Wow. Then it goes
*  on to name more groups. So that's 1725. Lewis and Clark were 1804, but those weren't, those were like,
*  you know, not Western, not extreme Western. Books that I read, I was listening to, I should say
*  on audio book about, uh, native Americans. Maybe it was, uh, black elk. Black elk speaks. Yeah.
*  Were they talked about him going over to Europe and taking part of those wild bill
*  shows that they did over there? That, that is one of the more fascinating things about the Wild West
*  was that these people that were involved in these historical battles then re-enacted them.
*  It would be as though this isn't,
*  the participants in the battle of Little Bighorn where they defeated the seventh cavalry under
*  Custer and annihilated his command. Participants of that battle would later get together.
*  Uh, they would get together cause you know, there's other, there was other like campaigns
*  going on at the same time. So like we think about Custer getting killed, but not too far away. It
*  was more soldiers that didn't, but anyways, participants of that would later get together
*  and play it out. Um, it's hard to picture that we would have, uh, Al-Qaeda fighters
*  right. It's reenacting. Come and be like, Oh yeah, I survived the global war on terror and
*  shit. Now we're going to show you like, no, I was sitting here when they kicked in the door.
*  Like, it, like how, how that happened. Actual people from like Gettysburg would get together.
*  Right. Yeah. And pretend to, yeah, I don't know. Yeah. I feel like if you went like my old man
*  fought in world war two, I feel like I've had you gone, I don't know, man, maybe when he's older
*  in life and they said like, Hey, do you want to get together with some of the, you know, what you
*  like to call crowds who were in the war and you show what happened when your buddy got killed?
*  I feel like he might be like, no, no, that still feels a little fresh. Yeah. Real fresh.
*  Yeah. I mean, and these guys were doing this not long after. Dude, they weren't even old men yet.
*  No. Yeah. Like a half a decade. It's, it's so, and we're talking about the level of animosity
*  that these people would kill each other on both sides and mutilate the bodies, deep, deep, deep
*  hatred. The likes of which is hard for us to comprehend. Like the, the, the impulse to, to
*  desecrate the corpse of your enemy and then get together and have a wild west show about it.
*  Mutilating bodies. You recommended a son of the morning star. Have you read it? Yeah.
*  Yeah. It's heavy. It's heavy shit. The things that they did to each other. Yeah. Yeah. And the crazy
*  thing was that the native Americans had no sense of, there was, there was no quitting. There was no
*  sense of turning themselves in. There was no sense of like, if you were captured, you're, you are
*  murdered and mutilated. So they would fight to the bitter end. Like they, they knew there was no
*  surrender because if you surrendered, you would be tortured and killed. Yeah. Like some of the
*  depictions of the tortures from that and empires of the summer moon. Yeah. Some of the things they
*  did to the bodies. It's just like, Jesus Christ. Like when did they develop such insane cruelty?
*  And has this always been a part of being a human being or was this exacerbated by the hard conditions
*  of the, of the planes? Like what, what led them to be so vicious?
*  It's a great question, man. There's things about like things that these great, the Great Lakes
*  tribes of like, um, making people eat parts of themselves, you know? Uh, but a lot of it had,
*  you know, there's like things about the, how, how you, if you could handle that, um, and not crack,
*  it was respected. It was like a testing, you know, but I don't know what it was like to live. I
*  can't even begin to imagine what it was like to live with that level of stuff. There's a, I recently
*  read a book called Plainsman of the Yellowstone and it was a history of the Yellowstone base and, and
*  this guy takes that whole, it's sort of like an antidote to son of the morning star because
*  he takes that, that Custer fight, which has become so emblematic of the West and like this regarded
*  as this big turning point in the history of the Indian Wars. And he treats it like just like a
*  little kind of like inconsequential thing that happened one day. Just didn't really matter. The,
*  the book was written, man. I mean, you know, I mean, it was like, everyone knows how this story's
*  going to end and that day didn't have any bearing on how it was going to end. A guy did something
*  stupid, got some people killed, the war ground on. It'd be like if we're, if it's like, it would be
*  like, if we're like imagining D-Day, right? It'd be like, let's say we're imagining D-Day and then
*  we heard about some peripheral story that happened on D-Day where like a weird thing happened and
*  some soldiers got killed and some guy made a mistake and got some people killed. And our telling
*  of D-Day, and let's say that incident was called the whatever, the Baculum incident. Okay. Now when
*  we conceptualize D-Day, when we talk about Custer, it's like, this isn't his analogy, but I'm
*  presenting it this way. When we talk about Custer, we're sort of talking about D-Day as the Baculum
*  and incident and we've lost sight of D-Day. You know, it was like just a little blip. It's like
*  a thing that happened that didn't matter. The war ground on, like they beat them. They knew they were
*  going to beat them. No one wondered who was going to win the war. It's like they, they, they,
*  some guy screwed up, got some people killed. We subjugated the tribes. And then it became bigger
*  over time. It became that we like that that story got infused with all this folklore importance and
*  symbol. And it's like deeply symbolic. I'm a sucker for it. Yeah, I am deeply symbolic. Yeah.
*  It was, there was no other way. You had to be close. It'd be close to each other to kill each
*  other. Yeah. It's a different world, right? And with the planes, Indians, even more intimate
*  because you're just dealing with bows and arrows. Yeah. The Lance is on horses. It's a different
*  kind of, a different kind of life and death. Yeah. And flying a drone over the middle East from Texas
*  and everything. And it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like,
*  different kinds of life and death. Yeah. And flying a drone over the middle East from Texas
*  and then going home at night and having dinner with your family. Yeah. Yeah. So it's, it's
*  interesting how we're more and more separated from that. And also interesting that the, the planes,
*  Indians seem to take delight in it. Like it was, it was fun. There was fun sport. There was ever
*  increasing ways to be more cruel and vicious. And it seemed to be there, there was entertainment
*  involved in it. Yeah. Some kind of honor code that I can't even begin to try to like guess at
*  and explain, but things that would land you in jail today for war crimes. Yeah. Were a matter,
*  of course. Yeah. Expected. I forgot to talk about your book. Oh no, we don't need to talk about it
*  I'd love it if you mentioned it. I'm very proud of it. Meet either guide to wilderness skills and
*  survival. This is your, how many, you guys have written, you had the, the two books on wild game.
*  Yeah, we have the guide book. Yeah. Guide books like complete guide to hunting, butchering and
*  cooking wild game volumes one and two, which is big game, a small game, then did a wild game book,
*  wild game cookbook. And yeah, this is a very pragmatic practical. It's kind of almost a response
*  to the sort of fantasy land that the survival genre has become. It's a lot more, there's a lot,
*  it's for people who actually spend time outdoors, avoiding, avoiding trouble, managing trouble,
*  conducting risk assessment. And then also just like how to think, how to behave, what to do,
*  what things matter, what things don't, what risks live in your head, what risks are real.
*  Yeah. And it's, it's, yeah, it's, it comes out December 1. Is there going to be a pre-order now?
*  Oh, I got a copy of it right here, baby. Is there going to be an audio version of this?
*  Man, I don't know. We haven't talked about it. It's illustrated. Yeah. That would be a problem,
*  right? Yeah. And it'd be, it's more meant to be like a usable manual. Yeah. Yeah. Like a usable
*  manual, but I'm quite happy with it. Thanks for bringing it up. My pleasure. Thanks for being here,
*  man. It was fun. Always. Always is. I'll come back in a year or two years, whatever. Please do
*  come back anytime. Your podcast is the meat eater podcast. It's available everywhere.
*  And then the show is on Netflix and sometimes it's on the sportsman's channel too, right? Yeah,
*  that's right. How does that work? You know, it has this like this complex thing of like first window,
*  second window stuff. So our episodes currently premiere on Netflix and then go to, you know,
*  you can find them on sportsman channel, outdoor channel, past episodes, but new stuff goes up
*  in Netflix and winds up there. And then we have, we just recently put our seasons one and two just
*  on YouTube. You just go check them out on YouTube. All right. We'll be adding to that
*  YouTube stash as well. All right. Yeah. Beautiful. Thanks for being here. Thanks a lot. Bye everybody.
