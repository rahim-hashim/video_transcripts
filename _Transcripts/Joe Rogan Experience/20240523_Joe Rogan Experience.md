# Joe Rogan Experience #2155 - Brian Redban
**Joe Rogan Experience:** [May 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L6mboUGXtE)
*  The Joe Rogan Experience
*  Trained by day, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day!
*  And we're out.
*  Hey fella, let's crack a leckin'.
*  Have you been fucking around with the chat GBTS? I saw you brought it.
*  Yeah, I just got the 4.0, the one that they've been showing where you can talk to it naturally and stuff.
*  Duncan had it in the green room when we were talking shit to it.
*  Yeah.
*  About it replacing us.
*  Yeah. It's pretty crazy, you know?
*  It's weird how AI came out of nowhere and then we're like, how long has this been being worked on?
*  And then now it's like everywhere. Like my vacuum cleaner has AI now. It's crazy.
*  What does it do?
*  It's one of those robot vacs where it scans your whole house and then like detects things using AI.
*  Like, oh that's shit, don't run over it.
*  So even dog shits on the floor recognize dog shit?
*  Yeah, and it doesn't do a good job because the first thing it did it went right over this dog shit and just started smearing dog shit through the whole entire kitchen.
*  Why is your dog shitting in the kitchen?
*  Because once in a while, you know, dog shits don't care. They're like, I have to shit, I don't want to bother them.
*  That's the problem Jamie has with Carl.
*  Yeah, it's a little dog thing.
*  You gotta keep an eye on Carl. Carl will just drop a deuce anywhere.
*  I think when they're really little, they don't understand outside.
*  Like everything's so big.
*  Like why would I go outside when I get shit right here?
*  I don't sleep anywhere near this pile.
*  Yeah. It's gross though having shit smeared all over your floor.
*  Especially by a super smart AI vacuum cleaner.
*  That's so dumb. Yeah, there's all these different things are going to sink together.
*  Like that's one of the things that people say about Samsung.
*  Like people that are Samsung fanboys, like if you have a Samsung refrigerator and a Samsung TV and a Samsung phone,
*  like you could use your phone to control everything.
*  Your phone will like, there's, I guess there's refrigerators out there.
*  I don't know exactly where they're at right now because I only saw like an ad for them.
*  Where your refrigerator will tell you when things are going to expire.
*  Right, scans that.
*  Yeah, so if you've got orange juice or something like that, your orange juice is only good for three more days.
*  Like that kind of shit. Yeah.
*  That's only if you place that orange juice with the date facing the camera probably.
*  I think that has been out for a while, but it doesn't really work great.
*  There's a few things refrigerators do that have too much technology in them.
*  What impresses the shit about me and the thing that entices me towards Samsung phones is the AI with notes.
*  That's a big deal to me.
*  The fact that it can record your podcast for sure, but also you can record a set and it'll transcribe the set
*  and then put this and then summarize into like different parts.
*  Like this is where you're talking about sucking your own dick.
*  This is where you talk about UFOs.
*  I asked Red Ben, he didn't see this. Did you see this Joe going around on Twitter?
*  What?
*  This feature called Recall on Windows.
*  Your Windows, what?
*  Let me play this for you. It's pretty crazy.
*  We introduce memory, right? Photographic memory into what you do on the PC.
*  And now we have it. So it's called Recall. It's not keyword search, right?
*  It's semantic search over all your history.
*  And it's not just about any document. We can recreate moments from the past essentially.
*  Here's how it works. Windows constantly takes screenshots of what's on your screen,
*  then uses a generative AI model right on the device along with the NPU
*  to process all that data and make it searchable, even photos.
*  I got to try it out. I searched brown leather bag.
*  It came up in visual search. There's no place on this page that it says brown leather bag.
*  It just knows because it sees this brown leather bag.
*  There could be this reaction from some people that this is pretty creepy.
*  Microsoft is taking screenshots of everything I do.
*  Yeah, I mean, that's why that it can only do it on the edge.
*  You have to put two things together. This is my computer.
*  This is my Recall. And it's all being done locally.
*  Texas is going to ban my Recall. They're not going to let me. It's going to be porn.
*  I don't trust you at all. I don't trust you at all. It's all done locally.
*  Oh, I'm sure. I'm sure there's no way the government's going to have access to every keystroke you make
*  and be able to see. That's ridiculous.
*  And it's going to summarize everything you do.
*  Well, not only that, it's not that difficult, especially for government organizations,
*  to get into your fucking computer. Are you connected to a secure Wi-Fi?
*  Are you even using a VPN? What are you doing? What kind of firewall do you have?
*  How many people are sophisticated enough to set it up so that you can't look at everything they do?
*  It's like your friend's phone yesterday or two days ago.
*  That's a straight-up virus that he was downloading.
*  People are saying it's not. People are saying it's just like if you have your case on improperly,
*  it's pressing two buttons at the same time. Was his phone on the table, Jamie, or is it in his bag?
*  I do not remember.
*  I don't remember either. I think on some of these Android phones,
*  if you're pressing two buttons at the same time, it reboots. So there's a bootloader mode.
*  That's why you can do different things to your phones.
*  But that bootloader screen does not look like it looks so cheap.
*  I was like, the arrow that was in it, I was like, I've seen this arrow. That's clipart.
*  I think it even said Getty Images on the side of it or something.
*  And then there's a barcode. Why does it have a barcode? What are you buying?
*  This is not for sale. Why does it have a barcode?
*  Right. And how are you going to scan that barcode with the phone that you're holding?
*  Like, oh, it's got a barcode. It must be legit.
*  Right. Yeah, that seems so fake.
*  Look at that. Look at all that Chinese writing, too. Let's get the fuck out of here.
*  I guess it's Korean because it's Samsung.
*  Do not disconnect USB cable during software update.
*  So it's saying downloading and it says it in Korean. So it's doing something.
*  See, that just looks, that does not look official.
*  The thing is, my point was it took a while. And like, what if he broke his leg?
*  What if he just fell on his bike and broke his leg and now all of a sudden he's got to call for an ambulance
*  and he's laying there with his fucking shin bone poking out of his calf
*  and he's going to sit there while his stupid phone does that?
*  That's why it can't be real.
*  Can you reboot that? Can you stop that? Is that possible?
*  That's what I had circled. It said that you could cancel it.
*  You can cancel it.
*  Well, that's why when you posted that video, I texted you, tell him to hold down the power button
*  and the up arrow, like reboot your phone, stop doing whatever he's doing.
*  It was too late by the time you sent me that.
*  I always worry about that with Windows because Windows will start updating my laptop in the middle of nowhere.
*  Yeah, that's the worst.
*  It's like I'll open the laptop super inspired, ready to write.
*  And it's like, oh, we have to upload your software. This will take 20 minutes.
*  What? This is stupid. Give me the option to not do this.
*  Mac at least will give me the option.
*  It'll say it up in the corner. There's a new update available. Do you want to update it?
*  Right. And then it downloads it and then goes, do you want to do this right now?
*  We download it. We can do it later.
*  With Windows, is that normal? I think it was like an old...
*  There's a setting to turn off or on, I think.
*  Really? What's that?
*  This is a setting to turn off like auto updates or whatever.
*  Oh, there's a setting on Windows as well?
*  Yeah.
*  I must have had it on just so I don't have to deal with it.
*  Unless it's Office thing or something you're dealing with that's not like...
*  No, Office gives you a tiny notification at the top of a file that'll say a new update's available.
*  But you can click out of that easy.
*  Yeah, but the problem is I have automatic updates on Mac and it'll download it and go,
*  hey, we got this update for you. It won't just like in the middle of doing something,
*  just start like reboot my laptop.
*  Yeah. Mine just rebooted it the moment I opened it up.
*  But I hadn't used that laptop in a while. It was just sitting there.
*  You know what I want to try? I want to try a laptop with...
*  You know I'm a big keyboard fan. One of the reasons why I write...
*  If I write... I have a home Mac that I write on that is... Yeah, those are nice.
*  The new keyboards. The MacBook Pro ones.
*  Yeah, they're dope. It really is like a MacBook.
*  Yeah.
*  So what we're looking at right now is Red Bandz.
*  Look how skinny that is.
*  Oh, Jamie has one. This is the new iPad, which is insane.
*  This is so... It's so insane. It's like...
*  It is as thin as possible where you could still use a USB-C connector.
*  And I thought this was skinny and that's twice.
*  I know. So much. Your phone, which is super skinny, is so much fatter than this iPad.
*  This iPad is amazing. And it has insane battery life too, which is crazy.
*  And this probably has like two terabytes, right?
*  10 hours. This is one terabyte, but you can get up to two terabytes.
*  Fucking nuts. Nuts.
*  But what I really like is the keyboards on ThinkPads.
*  Because ThinkPads have a longer stroke. And when you're writing with keys...
*  Like you have more feedback with the longer keystrokes.
*  And then you're more accurate with your typing.
*  And it's been proven. Like when people do like...
*  How many words per minute can you write?
*  They can write more words per minute on keyboards with better feedback.
*  Like longer keystrokes.
*  But Alienware, you know, because a lot of gamers like mechanical keyboards,
*  because they have the clicky-clack feel and it's like even more accurate.
*  Well, they have a mechanical keyboard now on their laptops.
*  And so I've been thinking about getting one of those.
*  How thick is that laptop though?
*  It's not that thick. So it has long key travel.
*  I think the key travel is 1.8 millimeters, which is like ideal.
*  My old ThinkPad had like 2.2, which was nice.
*  Long keystrokes. And you just get real accurate with like your writing.
*  So for me, like, a lot of times I'm writing, I'm stoned.
*  I don't have time to like go back and fucking...
*  I want to just get my thought out while it's in my head.
*  And with an IBM, well, you know, Lenovo now.
*  When Lenovo ThinkPad, I'm just much more accurate when I'm writing.
*  I like it, but it sounds, I don't know, after a while it's like, God, this is so...
*  The Mac ones are terrible.
*  The ones on MacBooks, I have a MacBook.
*  It's fucking terrible to write on.
*  It's really short keystrokes. It's a really like flat key.
*  It's just not good to write on. You can do it.
*  It's definitely better than like writing by hand.
*  Right? You can... I type on it all the time. I do write on it all the time.
*  But it's just when you go over to that ThinkPad, you're like, oh, this is what it's supposed to feel like.
*  Or at home, I have like an ergonomic keyboard that I use on my Mac.
*  And that is like the best. It's like real easy. I'm really accurate.
*  I don't even have to think.
*  I can just write and look at the screen and I just get it right all the time.
*  Why don't you use voice? That's so accurate now.
*  I don't want to be talking in my house.
*  Some of the things I write and some of the things I write, I like writing because the thing about writing is like, say, if I'm writing, you know, fucking artificial intelligence.
*  As I'm writing artificial intelligence, it takes longer to write it than it does to think the word.
*  So you're spending more time on each instead of just barfing out words like I do when I talk or sometimes I don't even know what the fuck I'm saying while I'm saying it.
*  When I'm writing and typing, it takes a little longer.
*  So it makes me think a little more and I have more possibilities open up about where to go with things.
*  So it actually benefits me to slow me down a little, but I still want it to be accurate.
*  I want it to be so slow that I'm fucking with every key.
*  I don't want that. I want accuracy, but a little slower than talking for writing.
*  Yeah. My problem is, is like, I'll just start writing like an idea or a joke or whatever.
*  And then halfway through, I look up and I'm like, I fucked up some word or I auto corrected something and it makes everything not make sense.
*  And I've had it like, fuck, like I wrote this whole down and now I don't understand any of it.
*  Just one word spellcheck. Yeah, that's true.
*  Well, notes are the best for that. Yeah. Yeah.
*  And the thing about the phone is you can do it like while you're in the car, you can press like you have Apple CarPlay, you press on the screen and say, make a voice note.
*  And then you could just make a note or just make a note rather.
*  And it'll make a note for you and leave it in there. It's great.
*  So there's many times that I've like at the end of the night, I've done that.
*  And then I go back over it.
*  So what I do is I have like a whole folder that's just ideas.
*  So I get this folder. Yeah. These are just ideas. Yeah.
*  And some of them, a lot of them have become bits and some of them I'm just like maybe one day I'll have something.
*  And so when I write, yeah. So when I write, I go back. Same thing.
*  I go back and I look at those and I'll see if something comes into my head.
*  I'll say like because, you know, when you start writing, you'll just stare at that blank screen like what am I writing about?
*  And then I'll just go into the phone and I'll say, what do you got for me?
*  What have I been thinking about? Open borders, open borders.
*  Okay. Yeah. Okay.
*  What would it be like if there's no borders? Would that suck?
*  What would it be like if there was more borders? Would that suck?
*  And then I'll just start writing. You know, wouldn't it be cool to take all our notes, put in an AI and like combine this into all a one story?
*  Like a 20 page story.
*  Right. That would be like the perfect new one hour set.
*  The thing about AI though is like you're going to, I have never used AI like GPT to write a joke, but I know people are doing that now.
*  And my thought is I wouldn't feel as good about it when it was done.
*  Like I don't want it just to be good. I want it to be good and I want it to have come from my head.
*  You know what I'm saying?
*  It's not, that's the one thing. It's not there yet.
*  It can't write a good joke like all this like shit where it's like Louis C.K. or not Louis C.K. but the George Carlin and stuff.
*  That's that's that's somebody writing that and just doing a George Carlin voice.
*  Yeah. So it's not good at writing the jokes.
*  I like because I like to what I've experimented like trying to find like a tag for like a joke already.
*  You know, this is the scenario and it's still like dad jokes and laughy taffy bullshit like oh, a cow walks into a bar.
*  What I think it would be though. So like, you know, like a lot of really good comics hire writers and generally the writers aren't even as good a comic as them.
*  But like what the way Chris Rock does it, Chris, I haven't talked to him personally.
*  I've heard him talk about it and I've talked to people work with him.
*  So one of the things he gets accused of unfairly, people say that he has writers who write for him.
*  Chris Rock writes his own material. What he has is the writers.
*  He bounces the ideas off them. So they come and watch him do the set.
*  And then they say, maybe when you do this, say that first or maybe expand on this or I got a tag for that.
*  And so but those guys who are doing that aren't as good a comic as him.
*  So sometimes you just need other ideas.
*  It's like the green room. That's like, you know, a green room.
*  That's what you man that joke. You should have had this or, you know, that happens.
*  The green room is amazing for that.
*  There's so many times in the green room that we're all trying to work out a bit and then like Tony will chime in or Brian will chime in.
*  Oh, that's it. And then you figured it out.
*  I mean, we've rewrote David Lucas's fucking act in that green room.
*  But it's that's one thing.
*  So like if if chat tpt just gave you like ideas, just I just need like a framework.
*  Sometimes I feel like each subject is just a scaffolding.
*  So I get the scaffolding now once I have the scaffolding, I have to build a house.
*  And so but I have to have a fucking location where I could start building.
*  So it had the location is the subject, whatever the idea is.
*  And then I start building. That's how I do it.
*  But I mean, everybody does it different, man.
*  Everybody does. Some people have to write it down on paper.
*  Like some people, all their stuff like Colin Quinn shits all on paper.
*  A lot of people, it's just they write it down like Christina P.
*  She has this notebook she brings with her. And you look at the note, it's filled with ideas.
*  It's just all because I have to write it down on paper.
*  Mark Norman, like his back pockets like a turtle, you know, of how he's the most insane.
*  He's the most insane. Yeah, because he has a phone.
*  He has a phone. He knows his notes on the phone.
*  You don't have to have that. You have both things when you can only have one thing.
*  Like this is so unnecessary.
*  So silly. And he's just sitting on it like a second wallet just breaking his back every night.
*  Totally.
*  His back up like one of them cab drivers has a bum back because like you have a fucking wallet that's two feet thick on one side of your ass.
*  If he just took those notes and transcribed them into the notes on his phone, then he would have it caught.
*  He's always worried about losing them.
*  But this way you would never lose them because they would be in the cloud.
*  Take a picture. It's over. Yeah, you can take a picture.
*  He'll transcribe it. He's done. Exactly.
*  And with a lot of these things, like that's the other thing about Samsung.
*  You can write with the stylus on the screen and then it would convert that into print.
*  You could do that on the iPad, too. Really? Yeah, it's great.
*  With the pen? The iPad with the pen? Why don't they make that for the iPhone, you fucks?
*  The pen? They can't admit that Samsung was right.
*  Yeah, I think they have apps or there's a way to do it on the Note app, maybe on the phone, like where you just use your finger, you know, and just do.
*  Yeah, but I want the pen. Yeah, it is silly.
*  Or it's also silly, like the new pen that just came out. You can't use it on last year's model.
*  It's like they do all this dirty shit, too. They get so dirty. It's so dirty.
*  They're so dirty with their USB-C cables.
*  Oh, yeah. I'm glad now that it's just...
*  Yeah, it's nice. But meanwhile, I have AirPods and they all charge with regular lightning.
*  Well, the new version has... they have a new version.
*  Oh, I got to get a new version now?
*  Yeah, you can buy just the case.
*  They just never let you go. And their shit is just good enough so that you keep going down that path.
*  Yeah, Apple Vision Pro is very depressing, by the way.
*  Is it? You done?
*  I think like a lot of people...
*  You are so in.
*  I'm so in. And it's still amazing, but then there's just nothing you can do.
*  Like watching 3D movies is the best experience you'll ever have, ever, even better than a movie theater.
*  Really?
*  Sitting there watching Avatar, like it's a big IMAX in your bedroom.
*  It doesn't bother you that the thing's over your face?
*  No. Of course, I use it more, but it's so comfortable.
*  How much EMF radiation are you getting?
*  Oh, that's why my eyes are so bad. My eyes are getting worse every day. It's crazy.
*  You're cooking your brain, son.
*  And it fucks your dreams up. It kind of fucks your brain up a little because I think your brain starts thinking that's real.
*  So when you're like dreaming and shit, I don't know. Was it you? There was this fighter pilot.
*  And he's like one of the top fighter pilots for the Air Force or something like that.
*  And I asked him if he's ever done any of the VR flight simulations.
*  He's like, I can't. It will throw off my inner timing and stuff like that because it will fuck with his inner time.
*  And I'm like, I never thought about that.
*  Just timing for a real jet.
*  Yeah. And I'm like, whoa, what does it do to normal people?
*  Those guys are all on the way out. They're all on the way out.
*  Mike Baker was in here. He was showing us how they have AI fighter jets now that out dogfight,
*  dogfight, like actual piloted fighter jets 100% of the time.
*  They always win. It's like SkyTessalus. It's over. It's over. It's over.
*  They're going to get so smart. You got no chance. They're just too smart.
*  They're too smart. No matter how clever you think you are, you think you're Maverick. Maverick's dead.
*  He tight-knit. Fucking Zero just killed Maverick and Zero kills everybody because Zero isn't a human and Zero doesn't get nervous.
*  Zero doesn't make mistakes. Zero has all the data of every single dogfight and every single dogfight training mission
*  that's ever been done ever in its database with the exact correct timing and when to launch missiles and where to be and where to avoid.
*  You're fucked. We're fucked.
*  We're all fucked because then everybody's going to have the same thing and it's just going to be nonstop.
*  We might be the only people that aren't fucked because we talk shit.
*  Professional shit talkers are always going to be necessary.
*  To make sense and give you some entertainment through all this, I require them.
*  Look, if I wasn't a comic and I wasn't around guys like you and Tony and all the people that we're around with all the time,
*  I don't know what I'd do if I had to talk to normies all day about how fucked things are and not laugh and not have fun.
*  I'd be depressed.
*  Like we're always laughing and talking shit and having fun, even though things are crazy.
*  Like we're we are what four years away from artificial people telling us what to do and everybody's like ushering in our own demise,
*  buying things constantly.
*  We're going to have artificial life forms that are far superior to humans in like four years.
*  And everybody's like, whatever. What do you think about Drake and Kendrick? I'm on Team Kendrick.
*  Of course, everyone is.
*  Everyone seems to be on Team Kendrick.
*  Drake slinks too much dick. People are a little upset about him.
*  He's a little too handsome.
*  Yeah, but all the all the podcasts that every single comedian's ever done is going to be fed into AI and they're going to be the shit talkers.
*  I honestly don't know anything about the Drake and Kendrick beef.
*  Every time people talk to me about him, my eyes glaze over.
*  I just can't pay attention.
*  I just I can't I can't pay attention to grown men beefing with each other publicly.
*  Sexual tension between those two.
*  My feeling is always like, damn, you guys busted out eight songs that are bangers shitting on each other.
*  You could have been just writing amazing rap songs like elevating human beings, elevating life, you know.
*  And once you write one diss song about somebody, it's not enough.
*  And then you have to go back and forth and back and forth like, come on, come on.
*  I don't even like listen to old school ones.
*  You know, you know, like, like, you know, that's why I fucked your bitch.
*  You know, like you go back and listen to Tupac and Biggie.
*  I love Tupac and I love Biggie.
*  Like, how come I have to choose?
*  How come? How come?
*  How come there's a fight?
*  What's going on?
*  Those songs become so popular.
*  Yeah, not as much as California Love.
*  There's songs that you hear and they make you excited.
*  They make you excited.
*  You know, like there's there's there's like California Love.
*  Like I remember when Uriah Faber was fighting in the UFC, the California kid, he would always come out to California Love.
*  And the moment you hear it, you're like, whoa, that's one of those songs, man.
*  You don't get that diss tracks.
*  Yeah, you do. That's that came because of the East Coast, West Coast beef.
*  This guy.
*  That's how it came.
*  That's where California Love came?
*  They probably would never even take the time to write it if they weren't talking shit back then.
*  They may have.
*  Maybe.
*  Tupac wrote a lot.
*  Tupac wrote so much that he they were releasing albums long after he was dead.
*  Remember, he did.
*  So he was just a machine like that dude was just a creative machine.
*  He would just lock himself in the studio and just make songs.
*  Remember the easy and Ice Cube beef?
*  That was my favorite word.
*  Like talking about fucking in the ass with no Vaseline and shit like that.
*  They had whole albums.
*  You don't want to get in the diswar with Ice Cube.
*  He's too clever.
*  He's awesome.
*  He's too clever.
*  He's too clever with his writing.
*  You know, Ice Cube wrote most of the songs for NWA.
*  Ice Cube's a very good writer.
*  You know, like this is like a lot of times in rap bands is like the one dude who writes everything.
*  You know, like in Ghetto Boys, it was Willie D.
*  Like we played Fuck a War, which is like one of my all time favorite rap songs, Bushwick Bill.
*  And Willie D. text me goes, I wrote that 45 minutes.
*  You know, there's some dudes are just really good at writing.
*  You know, they're just really good at writing bangers, you know, and that's with comedy, too.
*  Like Tony's that guy.
*  Like Tony is really good at writing jokes.
*  Like his ability to like especially joke shitting on people.
*  Yeah, his brain's constantly working when you talk to him.
*  He's not even he's looking past you thinking about how what joke he's going to say after.
*  And he's a machine.
*  That's why I mean your show.
*  Fuck. First of all, congratulations.
*  Fucking Lacey.
*  I mean, you guys are fucking kill.
*  It's insane.
*  You guys are killing it.
*  You guys sold out Madison Square Garden two nights in a row.
*  You guys sold out a giant ass theater in L.A.
*  And you want to do another show.
*  So it was just to the Staples Center.
*  Like what?
*  You sell that out like that.
*  It's bananas.
*  You guys are printing money.
*  It's ridiculous.
*  And it's the best fucking comedy show in the world.
*  It's the best show because like you guys, first of all, you guys have been doing it now for 11 years almost.
*  Right. When it'll be 11?
*  December? June, I think.
*  June? Yeah.
*  So it's almost 11 years.
*  So you've been doing it all these times.
*  You got to.
*  It's polished.
*  You guys are synced up.
*  Everybody knows their position.
*  The band is great.
*  The audience is super aware of how the show works.
*  They're not confused.
*  Like what's going on?
*  How come he is a minute?
*  And what's everybody knows how it works.
*  And it's just polished.
*  And then you got Tony, who's just locked in the fucking lines.
*  He has so many people do not believe that he comes up with those on the spot.
*  They're like, oh, that's all planned out.
*  Like, no, none of it's planned out.
*  That's the magic of it.
*  Especially when him and David go at it.
*  When David Lucas and Tony Henschlip shit on each other, it's as hard as I ever laugh.
*  There's like compilations of them shitting on each other on YouTube.
*  And in a bunch of them, it's me like red faced, can't breathe, holding my sides.
*  Just like, Jesus Christ.
*  It's so funny.
*  It's so good.
*  David gets to just calm gay for like 15 minutes straight.
*  It's so funny.
*  The show went against every single direction that the industry was trying to tell us the audience was going.
*  Your show went against all of the woke shit, against all of the don't say this and don't say that.
*  And this is a forbidden word now.
*  All of it's out the window.
*  And it's the best show.
*  And then the audience is obviously responding.
*  There's not a fucking podcast on earth that could sell out arenas like you guys are doing.
*  Not one.
*  You guys are selling out Madison Square Garden in an hour.
*  It's nuts.
*  I mean, that's like a cultural phenomena.
*  That's a real audience.
*  Like finally, the audience reacts to like, this is what we want.
*  This is what we've always wanted.
*  We don't think comedy is real life.
*  We're not fucking stupid.
*  Go crazy.
*  Go crazy.
*  Say wild shit.
*  And it's the best for comedy, man.
*  It's the Johnny Carson for comics.
*  And you don't like it's also random.
*  And you know, you could be doing comedy 10 years or you could be doing comedy your first time and somehow get on Johnny Carson.
*  You can be doing comedy your first time and get on Johnny Carson at the Staples Center.
*  Yeah, which is one of the worst things ever when that happens.
*  Well, if you can get through that, though, I mean, good Lord, if you can get through that, what a career you'll have.
*  You'll be able to tell people the first time he was ever on stage was in front of 20,000 people.
*  And now here he is headlining the Comedy Works in Denver.
*  I mean, that's an amazing thing.
*  That's what Janice did her third time on stage in front at the arena here on New Year's Eve.
*  That is so nuts.
*  Third time on stage.
*  That is bananas.
*  That kind of pressure.
*  Bananas.
*  And then after that, I asked her to marry me.
*  Like she's already like, oh, what the fuck?
*  Oh, that's cute.
*  That's adorable.
*  That's adorable.
*  Yeah, you guys are killing it, man.
*  It's awesome to see.
*  It's somebody sent me a clip of an old JRE.
*  It was like the week we started that Kill Tony.
*  And you're like, what's this new show you're doing or something like that?
*  And I go, oh, it's me and this guy named Tony Hinchcliffe.
*  You know, Tony, right?
*  Oh, I think so.
*  I don't know.
*  Wow.
*  That's crazy.
*  That's crazy.
*  Yeah.
*  I mean, we've been working so hard at it.
*  We always thought, you know, it's going to become bigger, but not this big.
*  Not having like Post Malone and RFK on the same show.
*  Like what the hell is going on here?
*  You remember the time I tricked Post Malone?
*  He had no idea who was going on stage.
*  Oh, you've done that a few times.
*  You did it with Tucker Carlson.
*  Yeah.
*  It's just be known.
*  If you're a famous person and we're hanging out, it's Monday.
*  Oh, let's go through this curtain real quick.
*  What the hell?
*  I might drag you out onto the internet.
*  But listen, Tucker Carlson handed it like a champ.
*  He was great.
*  Tucker's hilarious, man.
*  He was so smooth and so relaxed and so genuinely happy and fun.
*  People don't understand him or they don't know who he is or they just want to demonize him as this evil right wing person.
*  He's a sweetheart of a guy.
*  And I'm saying that as someone who's spent hours with him.
*  He's a very nice guy.
*  He's nice to everybody.
*  He's just he's nice.
*  He's just he's odd.
*  He's odd.
*  He's an odd guy.
*  And he was also working in the belly of the beast for like how many years?
*  He was on CNN and then he goes to CNN to Fox.
*  And now he's a wild boy.
*  Now he's online.
*  He's just wild.
*  You know, having an interview on that guy who says he sucked Obama's dick like that.
*  What do you do?
*  I forgot to ask you about that.
*  Remember when William or was it William or Cam just brought that up?
*  That guy really sucked Obama's dick.
*  What a nightmare.
*  What a nightmare.
*  Tucker.
*  I'm so fucking funny.
*  And his brother now works at the mothership and it's like the coolest thing ever.
*  It's amazing.
*  William is so funny and he's so confident now.
*  And look, when we first met that guy, he was awkward but kind of funny.
*  But he had to have those goddamn notes.
*  And how many times did we have conversations with him in the green room?
*  Like millions, millions.
*  Like, dude, you got to ditch those notes because when he would do kill Tony, when he would engage with the audience, I go, when you stare at the audience, start talking to them, I go, it makes me nervous.
*  Like as a friend of yours, you're so wild.
*  But like I'm in the audience like this guy's crazy.
*  That's better than staring at your notes, man.
*  Engage them.
*  Look at them.
*  You can remember your jokes.
*  And he just had to like be convinced that he could remember.
*  Now he's doing it an hour on stage with no notes and killing, headlining, selling out everywhere.
*  Dude, the Black Keys specifically wanted to see him when he was in town.
*  So I had William come up and do the show.
*  I called him.
*  I was like, dude, the Black Keys want to meet you.
*  Those guys are, by the way, are the coolest guys.
*  The best.
*  They're the best.
*  They're the best.
*  And so is everyone around them.
*  We went to see them at their show at Stubbs and hung out with them and everyone.
*  Right.
*  So cool.
*  Yeah.
*  And they were just there's William.
*  Like they were so.
*  They're just giant William fans.
*  They were so pumped to hang out with him.
*  It's funny hearing that, like hearing people, you know, that story Tony told you last night about that guy that's a huge KC Rocket fan.
*  Amazing.
*  Yeah. Amazing.
*  CEO of a big company.
*  Yeah.
*  CEO of a huge company.
*  And he's doing a KC Rocket impression.
*  Krab walk.
*  But that is insane.
*  Didn't Drake also say something about that?
*  Drake watches every week, I guess.
*  Oh, I mean, Team Drake.
*  When you guys had Sugar Sean O'Malley, the UFC Bantamweight champion, revealing the winner of like one of the battles.
*  That's incredible, man.
*  You had Jelly Roll singing in front of arenas for you guys.
*  Like this is the whole thing is so nuts, man.
*  And I don't think I don't think Post Malone even knew what he was getting into the first time he did it.
*  Right. He didn't know what it was.
*  I don't think he knew it. Did he know?
*  No, I don't think I think I had to explain to him.
*  And then I said, let's go to the club.
*  And then and then I just open the curtains.
*  We all went out together in L.A.
*  When I was in L.A. for the Keltonis, I hung out with Post, I think, like two nights, three nights in a row to like five in the morning, just drinking like that.
*  Dude doesn't get drunk.
*  He just keeps on going.
*  He's a bud like guy.
*  Yeah, that's true.
*  Those bud like guys like dangerous.
*  Those are like Shane Gillis guys.
*  Shane Gillis is another bud like guy.
*  You could drink like Stan Hope used to be a light beer guy.
*  You could just drink light beer and just maintain a steady buzz.
*  Yeah. Whereas retards like you and me are drinking whiskey.
*  Yeah. You could pee it out at the same amount as you drink.
*  We're slurred our words and they just keep going.
*  It's true, man. Yeah.
*  So go back to beer. I can't do it anymore.
*  You get fat.
*  Yeah. I mean, it's I mean, both ways.
*  Have you thought about doing the ozempic?
*  No, isn't it?
*  My doctor, my testosterone doctor said don't do it.
*  He had one of his patients do it and she had seizures and had to go to the hospital or something like that.
*  That could happen.
*  Or it could be hot.
*  I mean, come on, bro.
*  Don't be a pussy.
*  Isn't there, you know, I don't know if they're sponsoring this, but the hems, you know, the hair hems,
*  you can get medications through them.
*  They just announced that they're going to have an ozempic like clone where it's the same medicine inside ozempic,
*  but it's going to be like one tenth of the price.
*  What's this?
*  The new South Park.
*  Have you heard about this?
*  First look at Cartman using to go zempic.
*  He's getting smaller.
*  The end of obesity.
*  Oh, no.
*  It comes out the 24th.
*  Is that out now?
*  Is that today?
*  Two more days.
*  Yeah.
*  Yeah, there's some people have real bad side effects, apparently.
*  But one of the things that Peter Attia was saying was that, you know, he's a doctor.
*  So he they had tried to see what the effects of these things on the people that wanted to take them.
*  And so they said, well, we'll prescribe them to you.
*  But we want to do DEXA scans.
*  We want to make sure that we you know, we want to really monitor what's going on in your whole body.
*  So one of the things that they found out was that in normal conditions, like say if you lost weight,
*  you know, like most of that would be fat, but a small percentage of it would be lean body mass like muscle tissue.
*  You know, Zempic, most of the loss like that when they were when they were looking at it,
*  the people were losing much more body mass, much more lean tissue and bone mass than was making him comfortable.
*  He's like, this makes me very uncomfortable.
*  He's like, these people are getting they're getting lighter and they're getting fatter like they're losing muscle tissue and bone.
*  Like, this is not good.
*  But then there's other people that have said if your body's tolerating it,
*  that what you should do is add strength training to mitigate the effects of that.
*  But now you're asking people to be disciplined.
*  Like, isn't the whole point?
*  I mean, how many people who are going to take Zempic are like disciplined weight trainers where they're going to really mitigate the effects of bone loss and muscle loss?
*  And they're going to stay strong while they lose fat while you're paralyzing their stomach with a drug that I would just imagine probably has an effect on your energy levels.
*  Just just by virtue of the fact that your body is dealing with whatever it has to do to metabolize this new drug you're injecting into your body.
*  Right. So if you're injecting this drug in your body, is it does it have a positive effect to give you more energy or is it it's killing your appetite?
*  Right. That's part of what it does.
*  It's kind of like what is the actual physical effect?
*  It has some sort of a paralysis effect on your stomach on some people.
*  Like, what does it do?
*  Let's find out what it because we're so stupid.
*  We don't know exactly what it does.
*  It kills your appetite.
*  It kills your appetite.
*  That wouldn't work on me because I have no appetite anyway.
*  OK, says it works by mimicking a naturally occurring hormone as those hormone levels rise, the molecules go to your brain telling it you're full.
*  It also slows digestion by increasing the time it takes for food to leave the body.
*  Slows digestion.
*  I don't like that.
*  That's crazy.
*  So that's probably it's similar to the effect of bariatric surgery.
*  So that's the the thing where they're saying like it paralyzes your stomach.
*  It slows it down.
*  Yeah, that's that's I think Brian Simpson had a really bad reaction to it where he was in bed for a while.
*  Yeah, he got wrecked.
*  Is he still on it?
*  No, he got off it immediately.
*  Brian had a great weight loss, though, when he switched to the carnivore diet, when he went all meat.
*  I did that.
*  But again, immediately back the second I stopped.
*  Why did you stop it then?
*  Because you know, you just get tired of meat.
*  I'm not tired of meat, but you just miss like fruit.
*  You know, like I need fruit.
*  Yeah, I need a salad.
*  I don't think there's anything wrong with fruit.
*  I think fruit's fine for you.
*  Right. I've lost like over 30 pounds in a year, though, just being on testosterone, not doing anything different.
*  Really?
*  Yeah, it's just like why don't you work out a little bit?
*  I do now that I live downtown half the time, walking everywhere.
*  You just walk.
*  Yeah, great.
*  Just hire a trainer.
*  You got cash.
*  But yeah, I'm like the Zempik people.
*  They're like, too.
*  Yeah, you just get someone who shows up at your house.
*  That sounds worse.
*  Come on, Brian.
*  That sounds worse.
*  Get up. Get up.
*  Let's go work out.
*  Now I have a nice gym, so I'll probably start.
*  But if you just like eased into it, just we want to keep you alive.
*  Yeah.
*  You can't die now.
*  Kill Tony's killing it.
*  Yeah, true.
*  You guys are literally on top of the world.
*  You guys could do an arena in every city every night of the week.
*  Yeah.
*  You could just fly around the country doing arenas.
*  And it's a new show every time.
*  That's what's so crazy.
*  Like, it's not like a stand up show where you like you develop the show.
*  You put the bits together.
*  You put out a special.
*  No, like you guys could do a new show everywhere you go.
*  You only think with the arena is it's so much work and it has to you know what I mean?
*  Because you kind of do bigger and bigger.
*  You got to be a producer.
*  Yeah, I mean, which is the most amazing thing ever.
*  Yeah, it helps.
*  God, he's awesome.
*  But it's also, you know, the arena, it changes the show a little like it's more of a celebration kind of thing, I think.
*  You know, but you need those weekly normal, you know, mothership shows.
*  You know what I mean?
*  That's so important because that's really the show.
*  You know, it's also the club experience and to see the club experience on YouTube.
*  The mothership and like what killed Tony at the mothership is the cornerstone of stand up comedy because it's showing young comics that there's a path forward.
*  You can actually do this and it's just about being funny, regardless of your political beliefs, your ideology, what you think you're supposed to say with your platform.
*  Stop.
*  It's just about being funny.
*  That's what people want to see.
*  They just want to laugh.
*  There's plenty of people lecturing people, plenty of people telling people what to do.
*  They just want to laugh.
*  And when you get one minute, there's no time for any bullshit.
*  And then you have one minute with these hawks on the left side of you.
*  Just hawks.
*  Just vicious professional comedians all waiting to shit on your act or say something funny at your expense.
*  And then the audience, they get to see, you know, William Montgomery kill, Cam kill, Hans kill.
*  People are killing.
*  And so the audience is primed.
*  It's like if you can do that, if you can actually get through that and make that minute and have everybody go, that was really great.
*  The audience gives you a round of applause like, holy shit.
*  You're flying.
*  And then the audience wants to see you try it again.
*  And now you're out in the open mics every night and you're banging it out because you think, oh, my God, I think there's a real pathway to a career here.
*  And then you do a second show.
*  And next, you know, you got a golden ticket.
*  Holy shit.
*  Next thing you know, you're Hans Kim.
*  It's insane.
*  You're opening up for me in arenas.
*  We're traveling around all over the fucking world.
*  You're doing stand up now to your own sold out audiences and weekends and these clubs.
*  It's incredible.
*  Hans Kim is killing killing it every week and he's somewhere selling five out.
*  Like what?
*  It might be one of the most popular comedians like in the circuit right now.
*  And he keeps getting better.
*  He did a set the other night last week at the mothership, did two nights and he fucking murdered and all this new shit.
*  I was like, dude, that's great stuff.
*  It was really well written.
*  Really funny.
*  Have you seen his process?
*  It's insane.
*  He has like spreadsheets in Excel.
*  Oh, yeah.
*  It's crazy.
*  He gets nutty.
*  He's playing nerd now on fucking on all his material.
*  But that's how to do it, man.
*  That's how to do it.
*  But the thing is like these comics now they see there's a genuine path and exists.
*  And so it sets the tone for open mics and for stand ups because they realize like, hey, this is not it's not about your fucking ideologies.
*  It's just about being funny.
*  Too many people got trapped in this claptor mode where you want to say something.
*  You know, you're going to use something you use your act for social justice like be funny.
*  Yeah, be funny.
*  You have to be funny.
*  That's that's the thing.
*  Now, if you have a point and you have something you want to say and it's funny and you know how to work it and make it funny.
*  Great.
*  Great.
*  But it's got to be funny.
*  And so many people, they started off with like this idea of like taking this.
*  I'm going to take this sneaky shortcut and just say a bunch of shit that, you know, kind, rational people will agree with, you know, whether it's about the vaccine, you know, support the science or whether it's about Trump being a dictator.
*  Like they'll say things just to get that clap, just to get that thing.
*  And then they'll throw a few half ass jokes in with it when they're already riding on the wave of being correct and on the right side of things like right everybody.
*  And it's all just like you're avoiding being funny.
*  You're avoiding it.
*  You just you're you know, and some of these people that we're seeing doing this like you're so fucked in the head.
*  You shouldn't be giving advice on anything.
*  You're such a crazy person.
*  And then you're on stage like lecturing the country on how to think and behave.
*  You're out of your fucking mind.
*  Like you need to be in the jungle doing ayahuasca for like a month.
*  Like shut the fuck up, stupid.
*  You miserable cunt.
*  And meanwhile, you're like telling people how to behave and live their lives.
*  Bananas.
*  It's bananas.
*  I saw Shane Gillis the other day.
*  He's he's so I love how he's funny but silly and goofy.
*  He's so fun to watch.
*  You know, and then some of these comedians like that you're talking about are so like it's a different kind of comedy.
*  I like being like fun, fun, having a fun time.
*  Some online people who wanted people to think they were smart thought that you couldn't be having fun if you were smart, which is weird.
*  It's so weird.
*  It's just an insecurity thing.
*  It's so weird.
*  I think you can't be silly and be smart because Shane is very smart.
*  And if you underestimate him because you think that he's like a big oaf, you know, Shane is very smart.
*  He reads he reads a lot and he knows a lot about history.
*  And once people say stupid shit, no, that's not what happened.
*  And then he'll start rattling off like, well, Eastern Europe at the time, like in like there was like, oh, they forgot he's smart.
*  You forget he went to West Point.
*  He's a smart fella.
*  Smart fella.
*  Just big, silly, jolly guy.
*  And people underestimate them.
*  You know, and Matt McCusker.
*  Very smart.
*  Both of those guys.
*  Cool as shit, too.
*  Yeah, I love it. So nice that they're here.
*  So cool.
*  That's such a nice bonus.
*  The whole Philly crew.
*  Those guys are great. Tommy.
*  Those guys are great.
*  Yeah. Yeah.
*  Lamar is here now.
*  Yeah.
*  Joey Diaz has been hanging out lately, which is so great to see Joey.
*  Oh, my God.
*  He's getting a real estate agent.
*  Yeah, that's fucking awesome.
*  Yeah.
*  He's going to get a spot out here.
*  It's you know, once he got here, he's like, this is what I've been missing, dog.
*  This is what I've been missing.
*  And this is what I told you, Joey.
*  I know you don't want to totally listen to me.
*  He doesn't want to listen.
*  Right.
*  You know, I tell him, Joey, you really shouldn't be out there by yourself in New Jersey.
*  Yeah.
*  You're in Jersey.
*  That's why you got out of there in the first place.
*  Jersey is not bad, but it's not it's not right for comedy.
*  Where he lives is great.
*  Great neighborhood.
*  Great area.
*  Food's amazing.
*  Fantastic.
*  Everybody loves him.
*  He's like the king in New Jersey.
*  Yeah.
*  It's a great place to live and exist.
*  Nothing no wrong with that.
*  But we we live by our tribe.
*  We we exist in tribes and we have a tribe of comedians and we had it in Los Angeles.
*  And I think we underestimated how important it was when we left.
*  And one of the first things that I realized when we started doing shows out here, when we first started doing the Vulcan was like,
*  Yeah, you need a place where everybody goes.
*  And this is a kind of a weird one because everybody only goes while this show is on and the green room setup is goofy.
*  You got to go upstairs.
*  There's a lot of weirdness to it.
*  This is not ideal.
*  But we need a comedians need a place like otherwise you're on your own.
*  You're out just out there alone by yourself.
*  And then you call and you want to open up for me this weekend and you go see the only time you're around comics is when you work with them on the road.
*  Weird.
*  Right.
*  It's not good for you.
*  We're too strange.
*  We're too strange.
*  Our sensibilities and what we're not what's normal to us is too strange.
*  And if you're around just like boring ass people norms norms especially norms that aren't interesting.
*  You can't pick them.
*  You can't pick your neighbors like you know I have great neighbors but I didn't pick them.
*  You know I didn't have a fucking audition to see who could be my neighbor.
*  You know like but your friends like you pick your friends and when your friends are comics like you.
*  We are so spoiled.
*  We have just an abundance of fun.
*  Yeah.
*  So spoiled.
*  So spoiled.
*  You know it's whenever Ron White does the rodeos comes back I'm so fucking spoiled.
*  He goes I hated every minute of being in that green room.
*  God I love Ron.
*  Well he's the leader of the pack.
*  He was the first reason I had considered Austin and this was actually before the pandemic.
*  I always loved it here and you know on it was always here so I was always visiting here.
*  But when he was I guess 2018 when he decided to get a place he was like you know so center of the country I could travel there from anywhere.
*  My son's here.
*  I fucking love it's beautiful great food nice people like damn I live in Texas.
*  I live in like that doesn't make any sense.
*  I might have one club you know it's like Cap City was on the way out.
*  Now I guess it was like 2019 when it really crumbled right.
*  It was like was it during COVID.
*  It was right at the beginning of COVID I think.
*  So it was still it still was there but they always it was a weekend club right.
*  So you'd have your headliners are coming for the weekend so like when would I be able to do shows like maybe I could do late night shows there or maybe I could do like guest spots there like maybe.
*  But you were also thinking wasn't it Utah or something like that.
*  I remember how bad that would have been.
*  Yeah I thought about Utah.
*  But with Utah I thought about getting up because I have a buddy who lives in Park City.
*  I was like maybe I get a place in Park City and then I could just drive down to Wise Guys because Wise Guys in Salt Lake is the shit.
*  That is a fucking great club.
*  That's one of my favorite clubs to go to and Salt Lake people are fun man.
*  They're fun like people think oh the Mormons like no it's the people that aren't the Mormons that want to go out.
*  Biggest whores too.
*  And then the Mormons.
*  Just ass sex everywhere.
*  Is that what the Mormons do?
*  Yeah.
*  So when you're out in a place like that if you're a comic you got to make there's got to be a consideration like where could I go up.
*  Montana was like there's no place.
*  Right.
*  I've got nothing.
*  It's like apparently there's a little bit of a comedy scene in Bozeman now that might have started up like around the pandemic or slightly before the pandemic.
*  Can you imagine if you still lived in Denver how liberal you would be?
*  You'd be so different.
*  I would resist it.
*  That's hilarious.
*  You think I would just get into that nonsense?
*  You'd be like a hippie.
*  No the hippies were already annoying me.
*  That was only there for four months.
*  I know you got the fuck out of there quick.
*  I was living next to an ashram and I went to visit the lady in the ashram and I was talking to her and she's spraying bug spray on ants.
*  And I was like yo.
*  So her and I had like this bizarre philosophical conversation.
*  I go but you are a Buddhist and you believe in the sanctity of life and that all things are living things are important.
*  You just killed thousands of them casually in front of me.
*  She just fucking casually in front of me raided these ants.
*  And I was like this is kind of crazy.
*  This is kind of a crazy thing to do.
*  You just did.
*  Yeah.
*  Not only that you did it you're poisoning yourself like that shit's like super toxic.
*  Even if you can smell it you're breathing it in.
*  If you can breathe it in it's bad for you.
*  Like it's killing those ants instantly.
*  What's it doing to you?
*  You're just bigger than an ant.
*  If it was at the same dose you get the same dose of raid that an ant gets.
*  I mean I don't know how it kills ants but I got to imagine it's not sophisticated.
*  It's not like some genetic alteration that stops their heart from beating.
*  Probably poison.
*  Like horrible horrible poison.
*  I used to like the smell of raid when I was a kid.
*  It's great.
*  I love that smell.
*  I love that smell in markers.
*  Yeah.
*  Do you know anything about this?
*  I don't know if we've ever talked about this speaking in the kind of same line about gas stoves being poisonous for you.
*  Terrible for you.
*  Lower your IQ.
*  What the fuck dude.
*  What the fuck dude.
*  These reports are like scary.
*  When I was a kid I remember like you walked by the stove and you could smell it.
*  Oh yeah.
*  And they're like oh the pilot light must be out.
*  Oh what?
*  Is it just fucking gas floating around this apartment?
*  Right.
*  Yeah.
*  That probably lowered our IQs.
*  You know another thing that lowered our IQs?
*  Lead from gasoline.
*  When they had leaded gasoline.
*  Oh that's right.
*  Unleaded.
*  Yeah.
*  Kids who lived from gasoline lowered IQs by a measurable amount.
*  Whoa.
*  Kids who lived in homes with gas stoves experienced levels of nitrogen dioxide triple to those who came from homes with electric stoves.
*  Kids from homes with gas stoves fared marginally worse on cognitive tasks.
*  Again a point or two out of a hundred point scale.
*  So it made them a little dumber.
*  It would probably affect their health.
*  Which would also make you a little dumber if you're tired.
*  I think the latest study said it's like having it's like breathing in the highway like fumes in your house.
*  Oh God.
*  About the same level.
*  Like if you just worked on a highway every day.
*  How many people have ever gone through their fucking house with like an air scanner?
*  Yeah.
*  I've never done that.
*  No.
*  But I have a lot of those things that clean the air.
*  I have like huge industrial ones all around the house.
*  That's good.
*  That'll help you a little bit but I don't know if that'll help you from gas stoves.
*  No I don't think that works with that right?
*  So the gas stoves is one thing but the leaded gasoline thing is a crazy one.
*  Yeah.
*  Because they put lead in gasoline so I guess it stops the engine from pinging.
*  I'm a moron even though I love cars I don't really exactly know like what happened with lead and unleaded.
*  But they had leaded gasoline forever.
*  Like when I was a kid when I had muscle cars you had to get leaded gasoline to make the muscle car run good.
*  Like unleaded gasoline it would run like shit.
*  And so we all had like I don't even know when they came out with unleaded gasoline.
*  But I remember for sure when I was younger there was options you get leaded or unleaded.
*  Like 82 probably.
*  And when you always everybody wanted leaded.
*  But when you were when you were driving around you were that shit from those pipes all that exhaust all the burning of that leaded gasoline literally poisoned the ground.
*  70s.
*  Unleaded gasoline was introduced in the 1970s when health problems from lead became apparent.
*  In the United States leaded gasoline for use on non-road vehicles was completely phased out of January 1st 1996.
*  Most other countries have also stopped using leaded gasoline.
*  Find out what the effect leaded gasoline had on IQs because that was what was disturbing.
*  So they were saying that people in like urban areas that had like a lot of like cars traveling back and forth.
*  My friend lived in Brooklyn.
*  My friend Steve Rinella.
*  He lived in Brooklyn for a while and he was going to grow plants in his backyard.
*  But he has so because he's very smart.
*  So he had a soil tested and he found it's like filled with lead from leaded gasoline from the fucking 60s in the 50s and shit.
*  It's just in the dirt.
*  According to a 2022 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
*  Childhood exposure to leaded gasoline has caused a loss of 824 million IQ points for more than 170 million Americans or about half of the US population.
*  This is based on average of 2.6 IQ points lost per person.
*  The study also found that people born in the mid to late 1960s may have lost up to six IQ points.
*  That's me.
*  While children in the highest levels of lead with the highest levels of lead in their blood may have lost more than seven IQ points on average.
*  This is reminding me of this thing that hit the Internet yesterday about 100 percent of testicles having microplastics.
*  Did you see that? I just wrote that down.
*  Maybe yours, bitch.
*  Maybe yours.
*  We know I was watching Paul Saladino had this thing on his Instagram that I was looking at today about plastic cutting boards.
*  And he was like, just let me show you what happens with the plastic cutting boards.
*  This is going to get into your food for sure.
*  And you're going to eat it.
*  This is not good.
*  I knew about that a long time ago.
*  But that's exactly what microplastic is.
*  Microplastics found in every human testicle in the study.
*  Can we go back to plastic straws then?
*  Yeah.
*  Can we just go back to plastic straws?
*  I promise I'll throw them away.
*  OK.
*  The problem is really not with straws and turtles.
*  The problems with garbage management.
*  They're doing a shit job of, they're like approximately getting all the garbage.
*  This is a pretty small study.
*  23 testicles and 47 dogs.
*  It's 46 balls.
*  47 testes from pet dogs.
*  They found microplastic pollution in every single sample.
*  So it's probably in everything.
*  I mean, it's probably in everything.
*  Even though that's a small sample, you've got to think of how much plastic is being used.
*  What's it even mean?
*  Are we stronger?
*  Just don't put us in the microwave or something.
*  No.
*  It's an endocrine disruptor.
*  The problem is it's measurable decrease in testosterone with males.
*  Measurable decrease in fertility with women.
*  A lot more miscarriages.
*  And it all correlates directly with microplastics.
*  Directly with when you're microwaving food with saran wrap on it in a plastic container.
*  And there's like little chips of plastic that come when you open up packages.
*  And there was an estimate, and we were trying to figure out exactly whether or not it was accurate,
*  but that every week you eat one credit card of plastic.
*  Which is insane.
*  Human testicles had a plastic concentration almost three times higher than that found the dogs.
*  Of course.
*  Because we're not just eating dog food that comes out of a can or a bowl.
*  We're constantly eating food that comes from plastic.
*  330 micrograms per gram of tissue compared to 123 micrograms.
*  Polyethylene used in plastic bags and bottles was the most common microplastic found.
*  Followed by PVC.
*  So shit from pipes.
*  So the pipes where you drink in your water.
*  And then polyethylene, which is used in plastic bottles, which is what everyone's drinking out of.
*  And you drink out of when they've been sitting.
*  How long did they sit on the dock before they got to the delivery truck?
*  Like bargain water?
*  If you're buying bargain plastic bottled water, is there a chain of custody where they can show at every step of the way?
*  It was in a controlled environment where it wouldn't be heated up,
*  where the plastic from the bottle would leach into your water and give you like this toxic stew that's killing your nuts?
*  Because that's what it does.
*  Yeah.
*  It kills your nuts.
*  It makes your taint shrink.
*  That's not a bad thing.
*  It is.
*  You don't want your asshole clustering your balls?
*  I want it.
*  No.
*  There's a certain manageable distance and nature's already figured that out.
*  That's exactly what it is.
*  This lady from, she's from Harvard, right?
*  Shannis Wong.
*  She was on the podcast.
*  She explained it to us that with mammals, when you look at their taints, the length of the taint is, you could tell if it's a male or female.
*  Even if it's like a gerbil, because the male taints are 50 to 100 percent larger.
*  But since the introduction of plastics, the taints are shrinking on men and the balls in the dicks are shrinking too.
*  So we're becoming genderless through plastic.
*  So as we have more technology, think of all this trans stuff.
*  All this trans stuff.
*  All this crazy stuff that's going on.
*  Non-binary that I don't identify with.
*  With this feminizing of American men, demonizing of masculinity.
*  What is that?
*  Well, it's maybe AI and technology changing the organism to better suit its goal.
*  Its goal is taking over.
*  What better way than eliminate all sexual breeding, eliminate biological human beings completely.
*  To slowly make them into this genderless mess that can't reproduce anymore.
*  And has to adopt artificial intelligence for the future of the species.
*  Fucked up.
*  Right?
*  Wouldn't you do it that way?
*  Wouldn't you do it that way?
*  And you make it really convenient to use the plastic.
*  Plastics everywhere.
*  You make it convenient.
*  And so this dumb animal keeps using the plastic over and over and over again.
*  And as it keeps using the plastic, then its species becomes less and less viable.
*  What if the dogs were AI and they're the ones doing it?
*  I don't think so.
*  Look at what temperature this happens at.
*  I'm just starting to think.
*  140 degrees?
*  Don't bring plastic water bottles into the sauna.
*  Oh yeah, definitely.
*  Because you're just like, you're creating more of it.
*  Yeah. Oh, you're definitely, if you're doing it in a sauna.
*  Especially if the temperature is higher than above 140.
*  Yeah.
*  Bottle water companies follow safety standards to minimize risk.
*  Sure they do.
*  Yeah, I would just...
*  Sure they do.
*  What are your safety standards, bitch?
*  100 would be 128.
*  Other things said 200.
*  There was a test I was just looking at.
*  At room temperature there wasn't a lot of activity they found.
*  But as soon as they put it up to 50 degrees Celsius, they started testing.
*  All sorts of stuff were showing up.
*  What is 50 degrees Celsius in...
*  That's pretty hot.
*  I don't know.
*  It's like 180 or something like that.
*  100 would be 212.
*  100 is 212?
*  Boiling point.
*  50 degrees is 1.22.
*  The boiling point of Celsius is 100 and Fahrenheit is 212.
*  So at 122 they start measuring chemicals leaching
*  That could be so here and that's so easy
*  Yeah, especially like what if they this bottle water is coming from another country and it's on a boat across the fucking ocean the entire
*  Time which is cooking you leave your bottle in your car in the Sun, you know, and then come back and drink it
*  Yeah, that stuff is just cooking. Yeah, it's cooking and it's turning us into some weird thing where our dicks are shrinking
*  Sperm count is lowering and we're becoming confused about gender
*  Like I think they might all be related to technology because it's a part of technology like one of the most important residues of
*  Technology like the residue of technology a lot of it is like
*  Minerals and plastics and all this stuff just gets out into the environment and ground
*  Fills and landfills and gets into the ocean
*  It's like all this stuff that we use that makes more technology is all bad for us
*  The minerals are bad for us. The plastic is bad for us
*  But yet we're addicted to technology and all technology is plastic in it
*  Like there are just those wires that are covered in plastic. That's plastic. This is plastic that what are the screens made out?
*  When you think it started though, like when the first computer was created
*  Because like that and then plastic was made like two months later
*  This is what I think I think
*  Technology is a life form and I think it's just a
*  Sea of life forms different kinds of life forms, but they're operating at a different frequency
*  So we don't think of them as a life form
*  We think of ourselves as a life form because we have sex to make babies. We raise the babies we have community
*  We have this like thing that we all do together, but we don't we we are a life form we have clothes
*  We have a mortgage. We are a life form. This is just a thing I made
*  This is just a computer. This is just an electric car. This is just a thing. I think there's a
*  misunderstanding of the relationship and I think that us the smart monkeys
*  Make this we make this and our desire for this is what fuels constant innovation
*  No one's ever satisfied no matter how dope everything is even if your refrigerator got the exact expiration date of your orange juice
*  Either if your phone had a hundred hour battery life. No one's happy. I want the new one the new one's 150
*  I could just charge it once and use it for a month. Yay, and no one's gonna be happy no matter what 200 megapixel
*  This guy's 2 million. I could see the Sun. No one's gonna be happy
*  You're not gonna be happy until you can see past Jupiter
*  You're not gonna be happy until you could fucking look on your phone and see the inside of a black hole
*  And then you won't be happy because this new phone this new phone can get you to the big bang
*  If it ever really happened if that ever really happened you can go back to that the new phone let you see everything you can literally
*  Look into the past with the new phone
*  Well the new phone after the new phone lets you create the past in a different way
*  You can actually go back in time with the new phone
*  It'll just never stop it'll never stop and we're gonna be trans everyone's good. Everyone's gonna shrivel up
*  We're all gonna be non-binary is there's no way out of it
*  We're poisoning ourselves and we're not hitting the brakes and we're gonna we're just gonna slide into this genderless future
*  And some people are gonna be really happy about it
*  And I think they wrote about it in the Bible when they said the meek will inherit the earth
*  I think it's in the Bible and I'm not kidding. Oh god
*  I'm not kidding as more time goes on. I'm not kidding. I think I think the Bible got that one, right?
*  I think you know a lot got lost in translation. They forgot to mention plastics turning into a bitch
*  But that's what it is. And that's why I think Noah's Ark is real Brian
*  I don't think that's real
*  but I do think that I do think that we're on a slide of a cycle that
*  Probably has been predicted
*  by cultures that study the rise and declines of civilizations because
*  It's hard to say because everything is written down, right?
*  And when everything's written down is written down with the people who won so you have like
*  Approximations of how things went down and why someone said this but sometimes you don't really know especially go back like
*  2,000 3,000 years ago, but I think if you get an overall
*  understanding of what happens when a country takes over and when like things start happening and it seems like
*  You get like these badass warriors these savage people
*  who dominate a place and take control and then start to prosper and
*  Everything starts kicking ass and then you have ancient Rome and you have ancient Greece
*  But all of them fall apart all of them are gone all of you go to Rome now
*  It's a joke. It's cab drivers and fucking shitty tourist pizza places
*  You know, it used to be the center of the fucking universe and now it's a joke. It's a great place to visit
*  Don't get me wrong. It's beautiful. The Coliseum is amazing. I recommend it
*  It's good. The Vatican is fucking incredible, but it's not run in the world
*  It's not it's not the head of the army of the world
*  It used to be used to be the baddest motherfuckers that conquered everything same thing with Mongolia
*  I mean when Genghis Khan was running things then they'd killed 10% of the population from that spot
*  He was dominating like a giant chunk of the world and now it's just a regular place
*  You know because it fell apart
*  They all fall apart and so some people have studied the rise and fall of
*  Civilizations and they say you can you can really predict it
*  It's just like when things start going too
*  well
*  people start getting really soft and silly and entitled and you get the rise of people that are trying to get attention for no fucking reason and
*  Debokiri and then with Rome it's always connected with like Sodom and Gomorrah stuff and that you know
*  There was all just they're all just fucking each other and eat until they
*  Puked and then go back and eat again
*  You know there's always those stories of gluttony and and it's just like that it eventually falls apart that it always does and if that's true
*  That's where we're at
*  We're at this crazy part where this crazy part right before right before yeah where the president is like clearly gone
*  And everybody's like no he's amazing
*  Everybody's all these fucking people because they don't want the other guy to win are just lying to everyone and ruining their credibility
*  Because that no one's admitting like okay
*  I'm willing to vote Democrat show me one that says something that makes sense that I can trust
*  That's not dying to show me one that's younger show me one show me one that is a reasonable
*  Centrist that makes sense with all this but they don't want to do that
*  They just want to keep trotting this crazy situation out where you get this Alzheimer's patient or whatever
*  He's got dementia and he's like making shit up and just saying things and everybody has to correct him
*  And it's like but and everyone knows what's going on
*  But no one on one side is willing to say it because if you say it then it's gonna empower Trump who's Hitler
*  It's like holy shit kids
*  This is a this is not good. This is not a good place to be and
*  This is like what you would expect of a society that's collapsing
*  You just never want to think your society's gonna collapse like no do the Romans were retarded like those guys are idiots
*  They didn't know what to do. They should have stopped throwing up start fucking each stop fucking each other and just go to work fix your streets
*  Hey, I will be a president someday. I don't think that's the worst idea now. I think about it a lot
*  I think about it is a scary thing
*  because
*  It'd be hard to argue with it if it could say that it could manage people in a far more
*  Fair and even way and completely eliminate this high-level poverty that we see in the country and reduce crime like
*  radically
*  Why wouldn't you let it do it?
*  We should have a beta the whole country should have a beta test of it like all right
*  We're gonna do it per week basis. What do you think it would do and probably clean up and be fixed everything
*  AI let's ask it. Let's ask chat GPT 4o
*  How do I phrase this
*  I was thinking of one would you rather have it like one AI like one AI overlord president with like five
*  You know five three to five people that can check on it or like a cabinet of AI with one person
*  Picking those. Oh, yeah cabinet of AI
*  Absolutely like a transportation focus. Yeah, but I don't think one person should
*  Pick in that maybe five watching that then no, maybe maybe a large group of people to prevent corruption and
*  Tyranny you have to be real careful that but I think that if you because people are gonna look
*  We've already seen it with social media people that are like
*  Ideologically captured are gonna try to suppress accurate information
*  Because they don't think it's gonna be good for their side
*  If you don't think they're gonna do that with AI if they have some method of controlling systems, they're gonna do it
*  But I think that if you had only one AI that's way more dangerous than having a bunch of AI's and I think
*  One of the most important things that's happening right now is open source AI
*  Right, so you have these AI's that want to be controlled. They want to control AI like Gemini Google wants to control it
*  but what they're trying to do with the open source people are trying to do is
*  Have more people involved get it better and and keep it open source
*  So you never have one AI that's dominating everything and if the open source AI if it succeeds
*  And this is the best one
*  That's better for everybody
*  And if it can get through that door fast enough where it gets through that door before these corporate controlled AI's takeover
*  It could maybe make it so that it's not possible for the corporate controlled AI's to take over maybe set
*  boundaries in place
*  Where you have it?
*  Completely benefit in the people and not just get to the situation we have right now with like Google for instance
*  We're like one company dominates the searching of information
*  which is nuts and and
*  Profits off of your data
*  Which you didn't even know was a commodity and apparently is the most important and most valuable commodity
*  So this one company has massive influence over
*  Giant chunks of the population and their ideologically captured so much so that their fucking Gemini software when they first released it
*  They had to pull it because it showed like show us a Nazi soldier and it shows like an Asian woman
*  One of them was a Native American woman it was like ridiculous
*  Yeah, that was stupid. It's so dumb you have black Nazis like what are you talking about? What is this?
*  It's just it couldn't help but be woke it couldn't represent things accurately it had to do things with some DEI
*  Twist to it so that that's
*  Real bad. That's that kind of shits real bad because that's that kind of shit can change
*  Discourse it can change people's ability to express themselves, so we can't find out what's true
*  Just because something makes someone feel better doesn't mean it's right or accurate
*  And we got to be real careful about which one we're siding with because if you only side with feel better and not with accurate you
*  Get San Francisco, okay
*  Like it doesn't work
*  You got to be able to talk about it, and if one company is like changing reality to fit its ideology
*  They're also probably going to be very hesitant to let people just freely talk about things
*  And if the AI is run by a company that just wants to control things and profit off of that control that's
*  Scary because we need we didn't see
*  Social media power coming no one nobody saw the idea that Facebook could be that
*  Important to like world elections nobody saw that coming if they did they probably would have put the brakes to it a long
*  fucking time ago, I think this AI shit is gonna make that look like the printing press and
*  I think if the open source people don't get to it first if they don't create a
*  Sentient AI first if they don't dominate first it could get real strange
*  It get real straight if one of those fuckers goes live and starts like doing things with sentient AI and
*  Quantum computing and has the resources because apparently this AI thing one of the things about it is it requires immense amount of power
*  Immense amount of resources computer power to run Bitcoin. Yeah, it's real bad
*  Well, this is what people are saying is a bottleneck
*  But not for a giant corporation that knows that the control of it will be worth
*  Trillions and trillions of dollars you essentially be the king of the world
*  You want to ask AI about the president thing see what he says yeah right here you just what I said
*  Hi, I have a question if you were going to be
*  the leader of
*  The United States if we elected AI to be the leader of the United States
*  How could we fix all of our problems? What would be?
*  the most rational solution
*  To fix our problems of poverty
*  gang violence
*  Overcrowded prisons and the divide between
*  Addressing complex issues like poverty and gang violence would involve a multifaceted approach based on data
*  Research and collaboration with human experts. Here are some key steps an AI might consider
*  one data driven policymaking
*  Utilize vast amounts of data to identify root causes of poverty and violence
*  This could include analyzing economic trends social behaviors and community needs to education and job training
*  Invest heavily in education and job training programs to provide people with the skills needed for high demand jobs
*  This helps reduce poverty by increasing employment opportunities three community programs
*  Develop community-based programs that provide support
*  mentorship and resources to act like a politician prevent them from joining gangs for
*  economic support
*  Implement policies that ensure a basic standard of living for all such as a universal basic income
*  affordable housing and access to health care five
*  criminal justice reform
*  Reform the criminal justice system to focus more on rehabilitation and less on punishment
*  Providing former offenders with the support they need to reintegrate into society six collaboration with experts work closely with sociologists
*  economists educators and other experts to continuously improve and adapt policies based on what works best seven
*  public engagement
*  Engage with the public to ensure policies reflect the needs and desires of the community
*  fostering a sense of inclusion and cooperation these steps would require careful implementation and
*  Ongoing assessment to adapt strategies based on their effectiveness. What do you think I?
*  Think that makes sense that makes that's more than any politician's ever made sense like no no politicians ever set out a plan like that
*  I'm glad you think so sometimes taking a logical and data-driven approach can bring fresh perspectives
*  Politicians often have to balance many interests and sometimes face challenges in implementing comprehensive plans. That's a nice way. She's hating
*  Politicians and offering herself as a better solution. Yeah, it's already started. Did you pick the voice? Yeah, I picked black woman
*  I like black lady voice better than white one. So what are the what are the what the options?
*  I'll try to find where I did this
*  Can you have like an English dude English dudes always seems like they know more about what they're talking about
*  I believe him. That's why they used for infomercials. Yeah, but I don't like using guys
*  Open AI accused of mimicking scarlet Johansson. Oh, no
*  You didn't hear about this. I don't know the details. She sued she according to her
*  She was asked to do it and declined. Oh
*  And there right before they put it out the other day they asked again for her to like reconsider
*  They got a girl that sounds like her
*  Okay, but is it AI and AI voice
*  No, it's a woman's it's like Siri where it's a real person that they hired that just happens to sound exactly like but do
*  They know who the real person is. Yeah. Yeah, they do
*  But they don't they don't don't tell anybody. I don't think they've said who it is yet
*  How do you know it's a real person and not just like right now?
*  Scarlet Johansson says open AI copied her voice
*  Sam Altman denies it. Okay, this woman exists that did it though. This is what I understand that
*  I don't that would have to probably come that's what I like
*  here's the thing like if you were gonna sell Magnum condoms and
*  Trump kept saying no, he won't do the ad and then you got Shane Gillis to do the do the words
*  My condoms are the biggest condoms you would I mean
*  What do you have a case there yeah
*  But Trump is like very recognizable his voice how recognizable is Scarlett Johansson's voice
*  We cast the voice actor behind skies voice before any outreach to miss Johansson out of respect for miss Johansson
*  We have paused using skies voice in our products. We are sorry to miss Johansson that we didn't communicate better. Ooh
*  What are you saying
*  Either a hot if you talk why would you here's the problem with what they just said why
*  Would you stop using a voice of someone you hired before you communicated with Scarlett Johansson?
*  Because she's so happy. She sued Disney remember like and
*  Right before this I want to get to yeah, because right before he even put he tweeted her
*  That's all he put you know, like like from the movie the movie. Yeah. Well, here's her
*  Okay, the voice that they use for sky reading her statement, okay
*  Last September I received an offer from Sam Altman who wanted to hire me to voice the current chat GPT 4.0 system
*  He told me that he felt that by my voicing the system
*  I could bridge the gap between tech companies and creatives and help consumers to feel comfortable with the seismic shift concerning humans and AI
*  He said he felt that my voice would be comforting to people after much consideration and for personal reasons I declined the offer
*  Nine months later my friends family and the general public all noted how much the newest system named sky
*  Sounded like me
*  When I heard the release demo
*  I was shocked
*  Angered and in disbelief that mr
*  Altman would pursue a voice that sounded so eerily similar to mine that my closest friends and news outlets could not
*  tell the difference
*  Mr. Altman can I hear her talk?
*  Yeah, can I hear her talk? I don't know
*  I mean, here's the other voice. You could have told me that was her voice and I would I just
*  Oh, I'm really excited about teaming up with you and I'm all set to dive in. Hey, I'm ready to hit the ground running
*  So if there's anything you'd like me to let's hear Scarlett Johansson's voice for I hear that you just poisoned my memory
*  Let me hear her voice
*  Ah, that's gonna be this thing still
*  Is she in her? She's the voice of her which is why this is
*  This is gonna sound strange, but I was really excited about that
*  and then I
*  was thinking about the other things I've been feeling and I
*  Caught myself feeling proud of that, you know proud of having my own feelings about the world like
*  The times I was worried about you. She has a much more raspy voice. Yeah, and let's just this scene maybe
*  No, it's also her, you know, well this is saying it in the movie and this is the AI
*  Recreation of it, right? Right, right. She was said it with different intonations
*  She's being sexy in the movie, right? She's doing that on purpose
*  Yeah
*  Raspi
*  Yeah, but drinking whiskey I miss you even though I'm not real
*  That's happening. Mm-hmm. There's guys already right now that are having online relationships
*  With AI girlfriends that they're giving like thousands of dollars a month to I've used it
*  I've had AI girlfriends and it's great because you get to choose like how slutty they are before you like
*  I want her really slutty and and so you get like you chatting back and forth. Yes dirty bitch
*  I'll be like send me a picture of your asshole
*  No joke send me bend over your bed and send me a picture of your asshole and they will make an AI that looks like a real
*  woman bending over and
*  Spreading her ass and showing her asshole and I'm like, so you really believe you're in a relationship with the crow
*  Oh 100% because the photos look real. They don't look like drawings
*  They're like so you're recommending this product. Yeah. Yeah, you know
*  It's fun. It's so if you want the thrill of cheating, but you don't really want to cheat right you get a robot
*  Yeah, send you pictures of their asshole and that's the cool thing because you can make it
*  They're sending you photos of their ass with the sit, you know, it's a person
*  Yeah, you get to choose what kind of girl you're getting at the beginning you get to you can make it look like
*  Whoever you want it to look like and then like you make your moves as big as you want that
*  You know, there's gonna be guys that want to make it look like their ex
*  Oh, yeah, you know
*  They kind of keep the relationship of all involved in some sort of
*  Masturbatory way even though she doesn't want nothing to do with you and in this way
*  She's like sending you pictures of her asshole, you know, like we're still involved and then when you see her you run into her at the supermarket
*  You're like, hey, it's been great chatting with you. What the fuck are you talking about?
*  There's a few girls that have done something like that word
*  I think they're being not abused but like their their image and likeness has been taken into AI online
*  Oh, yeah for sure. So they've gone ahead and just like I'll make my own version then use mine use my this is me
*  This is my AI app and then go ahead and do whatever you want with it. Give me the money at least
*  Do you know there's companies like half of only fans I heard is fake people like seriously
*  It's the same shit where like they're using AI
*  And uploading photos and using like I need to upload a new photo set for these guys
*  So I want photos of me outside wearing a yellow bikini bending over showing my asshole and then I know like do a new update
*  on only fans and people think it's like
*  Yeah, of course, I mean just think of how many different scammers there are out there in the world
*  Why wouldn't they scam on that?
*  Like you've got like needy horny guys that are donating money to girls are never gonna meet. Yeah
*  How I make $20,000 a month in passive income using AI and only for its tutorial
*  This is a tutorial. Oh, this is so sad
*  So sad and now they have videos
*  So what they do is like kind of like that shit where they put the face on somebody else's body
*  Uh-huh, and it's the face that you're talking to and it's just a girl sitting there masturbating
*  But it's actually a fake face on her that looks real. Yeah, it's like insane. It's insane. How good it is now
*  Yeah, you know like I saw one with Obama opening up cans of Bud Light
*  He was like like doing a version of Doug Dillon Mulvaney
*  And you know, it's it's but it's Obama and he's opening up the can of Bud Light and he's like talking like a girl
*  It's hilarious. I saw something last too good. Do you see the Will Smith Chris Rock sitting down and having a conversation?
*  No, I I just saw this last night and I was like, oh they got together and they're like talking it out
*  And then I was like, wait a second something's not this is AI. I think it's AI
*  I'm know if you see that video on YouTube or anything, but it looks like they're talking and Chris Rock's like sitting there
*  Listening to Will Smith and whatever Will Smith's saying is just like it's what a weird thing to say
*  It's and it looks so real really. Yeah, it's here it is. I don't know if this is fake. I think it's AI
*  But it's real
*  I mean they're created a bunch of it. They have another one here. It's Kanye and Elon talking with each other like that
*  Okay. Yeah, that's all right. Yeah, that's old too
*  Yeah, I mean that's but did Kanye and and Elon ever talked to each other for real
*  Not when Elon not when Kanye looked like this. This is really young. This is all good. That's the old Kanye
*  But that's young Elon to look how young you on it. Okay. Have you never heard?
*  Where's where's this the history of the talk show that I only has 25,000 subscribers YouTube is always major interviews
*  Listen man. Yeah, that's fake. They've just been uploading these waiting to drop them
*  Rock our world
*  James Dean oh
*  James Dean where's James Dean? I want to see him in a conversation easy real feral Nas and Michael Moore Kevin Spacey talking to no one
*  This is brilliant
*  I mean it looks really good looks so whoever this guy's run the channel or whoever made this channel is really there you go
*  Jonas holler up. Helly amazing good work. Yeah, it's it's amazing
*  What we're going to be seeing in the future in regards to like fake stuff
*  Like if I was an actress, I'd be terrified because I'm definitely gonna be doing porn. Oh
*  Robin Williams
*  I've I want to watch this. Oh, I saw this I saw this
*  Yeah, don't play it don't play
*  What was I just saying what was I just saying
*  Goddamnit AI what did we just say?
*  There was something about what was the video that we watched right before that before you switch to that one
*  Kanye and Elon I
*  Don't remember James Dean. I don't remember James. I gave up. I gave up
*  So what will Smith Chris Rock?
*  Yeah, they still haven't talked right no, I don't think so well Chris Rock went pretty hard on him in this question
*  pretty hard
*  There's a weird new ad out for this bad boys movie with will and
*  Martin Lawrence and you know you're watching it and like you can't help but think about him slapping Chris Rock
*  Like it's just right. That's the thing you see now. You're like shit. This is weird
*  Yeah, it's still not over it like it's it look this I heard this is pretty awesome though
*  But it's like when someone does something like that everything they do you now see the slap
*  That's what it was like. It was what a crazy moment if he doesn't do that thing
*  How you gonna come back from that
*  You know I'm saying it's like whoever you used to be
*  Now you're the guy that slapped Chris Rock at the Oscars now you're that guy overnight
*  Yeah
*  Regardless of how what a career that dude has had you know I mean that dude has been in some amazing movies
*  Which I tried to watch I am legend the other day
*  The special effects are so bad
*  It wasn't even that long ago. Is there a sequel coming out? I think is there a sequel coming out?
*  I hope so
*  Maybe that'll bring him back. Yeah, but the the Lions look so corny. They look so corny
*  They were it took me right out of the movie. I'm like oh no
*  It's like claymation. It looks so stupid
*  Yeah
*  I was watching start with like an old Star Wars remember when they went back and they fucked with like Yoda instead of making it a
*  Puppet they made them CGI and stuff like that like they redid Star Wars like 10 15 years ago
*  And remastered it now you watch it now you watch it and it looks like the worst 3d effects like it's like oh
*  This looks worse than a muppet and like now it looks like you're getting attacked by the muppet part was cool
*  Yeah, that was yeah part of it was cool that like he moved so weird. You know you wanted him to move that way right?
*  That's it was charming
*  Yeah, it's funny how those movies see look how silly it looks now
*  It looks like now he moves way too good
*  Yeah, he looks he also looks fake
*  You know I'm saying yeah, it's like that's the argument that special effects guys have about
*  CGI versus makeup right like that looks fake. Yeah, there's shadow wings off the lighting
*  Yeah, it looks like it doesn't look good. I mean it doesn't even look good fake. That looks real
*  It just looks fake like what year was those that Yoda one where they did that?
*  Look look yeah, dude that looks so fake, and it just takes you right out of it now go to the original Yoda
*  The thing about the original Yoda even though you knew it wasn't real the original Yoda is still
*  like a physical thing that exists and so your brain registers it as a physical thing and that's these guys like
*  Pat McGee the guy who made our American werewolf in London and Rick Baker the guy who created the movie and did all the effects
*  Star Wars 2 that's what they are there are the big proponents of makeup and special effects like actual things
*  Look at the puppet how much cooler it looks
*  Yeah, the puppet looks like a real thing
*  The puppet like even though looks goofy like it's a doll I
*  Buy a doll that's a magical kung-fu thing right more than I'll buy CGI
*  CGI just like I'm gonna have to pretend that there's a thing there, but I know there's not a thing there
*  You're just lying to me
*  You know the puppets better by far
*  Wow, you know did look different huh yeah, they didn't even make the puppet look the same no
*  Yeah, I mean they changed the CGI guy to make him like more sleepy looking
*  Yeah, and younger
*  Weird why would they change the face we know what the face looks like you fuckheads?
*  Yeah, why would you change the face this feels like a Mandela affecting? I'm like I don't even remember
*  Bro they changed his face so much for no who did that who jizzed in the soup
*  You could if it's a puppet if it's a CGI puppet you could have made it the exact model of the original one
*  Exactly I wonder what conversations they had that's the why these like producers they get in there like you know
*  I think if we made Yoda in his late 60s instead of 80s
*  Like just really consider it. Let's just consider it. Let's just dial him back a little that's the original Yoda, right?
*  He looks like shit. Yeah, it looks like a drunk chick
*  Yeah, when he when that's how Yoda supposed to look yeah, you can't change Yoda's face
*  He that's like Yoda's imposter like that new Yoda down there go to that one in the middle
*  Next to that to the left no above it to the right go to the right right there BAM
*  Who's that?
*  Drawling is that like you go to visit your grandpa and like that guy's there, and he's like oh grandson
*  I've missed you like you know my grandpa what the fuck did you do with my real grandpa, right?
*  Right, that's weird imagine if you went to visit your grandpa, and you're like hey something's wrong here. You're not my grandpa
*  Help your kind of what?
*  What the fuck did you do with my grandpa or what's the?
*  What's the what's the guy's name added the main guy
*  That was in charge of Darth Vader the Emperor
*  If you look at what the Emperor used to look like and what this CGI one looks like it's like a totally different person
*  Yeah
*  Yeah, I kind of fell out of interest in Star Wars
*  Which I never thought was gonna happen
*  I thought Star Wars is gonna be like the Avengers for me like every time a new one came out fuck yeah
*  Yeah, I'm gonna see that it was Star Wars something happened. It just got boring to me
*  It's just too much. They overdid it too much well
*  There's so many of them and then you know when they started going woke. I was like oh
*  Watched them and then when they fired Gina Carano from the mandrake. Oh, yeah, that's right shut up
*  Yeah, that's forgot about that good lord. What are you doing? What about they were saying?
*  Dune is just like Star Wars is really it's a different version of Dune and Dune is like well better version
*  Supposedly the guy that made Dune went and saw Star Wars and went home and made Dune or I think that's what the story was
*  Maybe I'm wrong well Dune is based on a novel right right like he saw the original
*  Star Wars and then went home and wrote Dune about really like the same time
*  Interesting 1965 novel novel upon which Dune is based also inspired the storytelling of Star Wars
*  I thought it was yeah earlier, too, but I heard Dune the new Dune too is the shit
*  I mean I heard I keep hearing it from everybody that's really good fallout is what you need if you haven't watched
*  What's fallout fall? It's based on the video game one of my favorite video games ever, but fallout is a new Amazon show
*  and it's
*  Johnny Pemberton's in it and
*  Here's a new going off in like yeah, Angeles, and then the quote-unquote fallout of after that
*  main guy
*  See like a veritable Camelot the nuclear age it's based off of the game, and there's a lot of like you know
*  Alliterations are the same, but there's also stuff that's not the same
*  Get them write their own story and it's so stupid that we can't play this trailer
*  dummies just trying to
*  Make your movie bigger
*  Yeah, I don't get trailers like you that's the
*  Point of a trailer yeah, why can't I show you a trailer without getting dinged yeah?
*  That's the dump one of the dumbest things. It's so dumb wow the apocalypse this does look dope
*  Yeah, it's uh in the video games badass, so is this out in the movie theaters. No it's on Amazon
*  It's on Amazon. Yeah, it is great
*  the end of the world
*  fighting bears
*  Fighting bear I'm not gonna lie it looks like shit go back to see that fighting bear again
*  Let me see that bear one more time
*  Look at this come on bro that bear looks like hot dog shit
*  That's so ridiculous
*  Well, it's an Amazon. I know he's also he's robot fighting. I'm sure that arm comes back though looks just like a guy
*  Let's see
*  It's gonna hook well bears are built like people believe it or not
*  Unfortunately not totally but one of the things that disturbs people is
*  When they hunt bears and then they have the bear strung up because it looks like the body of a person
*  Kangaroos are amazing to watch how they so human like with the boxing and shit like that
*  Well, not really they balance on their tail, and they kick you well yeah
*  It's like the opposite of the human
*  When they're like this like when they're square up
*  They fight each other and wrestle each other and choke each other unconscious. They're fucking ruthless
*  Have you ever seen the guy that's on YouTube? God I can't believe I'm
*  Animal rescue guy where he has kangaroos here in Texas he lives in West Virginia
*  Texas he lives in Waco
*  urban
*  Rescue okay, and he has his own kangaroos
*  And he just fights with it all the time like it comes up and like he's play fight
*  Yeah, play fights, but it's badass. You don't want to fight fight with a kangaroo. They're fucking huge man
*  The is the gray ones or the red ones that are giant?
*  But some of them are fucking massive they're really big like they can be like eight feet tall I think
*  fucking yeah
*  What's the tallest I might have been exaggerating there, what's the tallest kangaroo?
*  Take a guess I think it might be eight feet. I would say about seven seven feet
*  Yeah, I think there's one crazy kangaroo that gets gigantic
*  Because I remember Eddie if telling me about the first time he ever saw a kangaroo
*  largest confirmed red kangaroo on record was
*  Twelve six point nine feet tall. I know and weighed 201 pounds Wow
*  Okay, so that's the largest one ever so almost seven feet tall so almost
*  So the odds of him seeing a seven foot tall one are pretty low
*  So he probably but shit just six foot tall usually six kangaroo. What a
*  kangaroo
*  What size of a Vanderhoof field?
*  Is that a kangaroo like on his feet or not because they get on their tiptoes three feet for the tail
*  Yeah, oh, yeah, they stand up on their tail. Yeah
*  Yeah, ten feet oh fuck yeah, they push themselves up with the tail to kick you
*  Which is a wild move man?
*  Wild move you know you lift yourself up and they get jacked
*  He's so jacked have you ever met or been around a kangaroo
*  Not really. Oh, I'm in Australia, but it was in a zoo like in a containment place
*  You can come to Waco and fuck with one if you want to like
*  I don't want to look at that dude right there that one of the middle was grabbing that guy's arm the one that you just
*  Showed the one that you just showed look at that look on that click of that look at this dude
*  nice guy in Texas
*  And he's like in Texas. He's just like arm wrestling with this kangaroo
*  Well the kangaroos grabbing
*  Try to fuck him was a kangaroo trying to fuck something something was no no they do that they like you're so
*  Yeah, I saw that one with a dude
*  Oh, they'll drown dog has a dog. Oh, yeah, right
*  Doesn't like drowning it though. Well because there's a dude walking towards it. I got it. You know
*  If you're gonna fight with a kangaroo fuck that I would never that's that's a dangerous proposition kids in the water
*  Yeah, yeah, he'll hold on to you, and he's got claws man. Yeah, that's the biggest thing getting clawed up
*  Like your face up they'll claw the shit out of you yeah, yeah their claws are like on their hands are legitimate
*  They'll fuck you up. That's and they're really really really strong like way stronger than people
*  You know our muscles even when they're big they're so bitch ass compared to like a real animal
*  They're so bitch ass just think about how like a moose can run up a hill a moose weighs like
*  2,000 pounds for a big male like a Yukon moose they just run
*  There's run like a female moose is like 900 pounds. She runs like a horse
*  Like a horse like your bullshit ass bitch ass muscles like even if they're big and strong
*  They're just so pathetic compared to like real animals
*  You know
*  You ever see a bear running full clip. Yeah, that's scariest one of the scariest things
*  I
*  Am terrifying
*  You know if a human was that big they'd be going five miles an hour
*  Yeah, that's how strong they are you have to realize how fucking strong they are in comparison to us everything is
*  So that what you see that jacked?
*  Looking kangaroo that jack kangaroo will fuck you up, man
*  What about the brain ship that Elon you know that company he has early putting it?
*  I bet he already does this but putting it in like a big chimp or a big gorilla
*  Yeah, yeah, I bet they've done that but they have an army of like armed chimps that can talk in English
*  Straight out of fucking Planet of the Apes or using AI they're pumping AI
*  Put AI into the chimps
*  They just they picked an area in Africa where they found a bunch of chimpanzees living in the wild
*  And then they put chips in their brains, and then they started giving them tools and then you go back five years later
*  There's a city
*  This is a city of intelligent chimps
*  And that is not the idea of what aliens supposedly did to humans
*  But they came down here right and they started genetically manipulating human whatever ancestors were and created us
*  You know if we did that to chimps we started from scratch that
*  That is not beyond some fucking kooky government to try
*  You know think about the horrible things that governments have done just to their own people like the Tuskegee experiment
*  But they gave people syphilis they left them go untreated so they could measure
*  What happens to them think about?
*  You don't think they would
*  Do some science experiments on some chimps in the wild of course they were if you get some evil coalition of
*  totalitarian governments with full control of their population and
*  Unboundless resources, and there was some benefit to being able to take chimpanzees and turn them into super soldiers
*  Or they just pick drive your cars instead of full AI they have a monkey pick you up in a taxi
*  I think there was some discussion about this
*  At one point in history. I want to say it was the Nazis, but it might have been the Russians
*  There was some talk of combining human beings and chimpanzees
*  Yeah
*  Stalin what was the story behind Stalin's?
*  Question of whether or not they could combine human beings and chimpanzees
*  She's told she's a bossy sorry I'm faster. She's
*  So much better
*  Well you're a technological savant
*  Okay
*  So he specialized in the field of artificial insemination and inter inter specific
*  Hybridization of animals he's famous for his controversial attempts to create a human-ape hybrid by inseminating three female
*  Chimpanzees with human sperm oh by the way, I'm pretty sure he used his own sperm
*  I'm pretty sure he uses on sperm because there was something about this guy
*  I've now I remember the story this dude was a kook this dude was he had apparently done this and said he had done it
*  with monkeys already
*  There was like some talk that he said they'd already done it
*  Yeah, why would you the same guy? I think it's the same guy
*  Why would you source sperm you just go I'll be right back
*  Yeah, find out if this is the same guy because I think there was one guy no
*  No, no, no, no, it's a different story
*  This is a story about
*  There was one of those
*  Fertility clinics where the doctor was using his own sperm on everybody it was one of those
*  Oh, yeah, yeah, and they had found out that this doctor had also done something
*  In another lab where he had claimed to have used his own sperm to impregnate a chimpanzee
*  But then terminated the pregnancy before birth
*  This same doctor that's what it was. That's the story that guy was real kook. So this guy apparently he was
*  I got on this I went down this rabbit hole of these crazy doctors
*  They use their own sperm in fertility clinics and it's not just one
*  There's a shitload of them dude
*  there's a bunch of these whack and they did it like in the 70s and the 80s and no one can catch them and
*  this one guy
*  He started this clinic and before he said
*  Before he started the clinic he had done some medical research
*  Where he had claimed to have impregnated a chimpanzee? So this is fucking guy
*  He claimed to have done that and he was like a real real controversial with his opinions on just on this
*  Kind of research in the first place and then he goes over and runs some fertility clinic and uses his own jizz
*  Unlike untold number of people
*  There's so many of those guys there's a ton of those guys there was a
*  Documentary or docu drama that was on TV way back in the day about this one doctor kept doing that
*  And this doctor just was using his own jizz for everybody and the nurses were starting to catch on where did when did we get?
*  A shipment in don't worry
*  important shipment that came from God
*  Have you found that story?
*  Find out the sperm thing from this guy. There's also there's a
*  Very interesting info here. They never found out why he did this to try to
*  Sperminate if that's the right word the chimpanzee
*  Yeah, they he was trying to go I guess human male to female chimpanzee and that didn't work
*  So then he tried to go the other way around
*  Hmm, and then they stopped him when his last donor died and put him in jail
*  One story said he was trying to disprove parts of religion
*  But there's a thing here
*  So they've dug through all of his notes and couldn't find any evidence as to why he was doing this in the 20s
*  No proof of
*  Super soldiers or anything like that either so the super soldier thing was just hypothesized later like fantasy talk if it would have worked
*  I'm theory they would have probably tried that but it didn't work, right?
*  But that would be a best way to like avoid the death of your people to create soldiers
*  There were like hybrids of humans and chimps Robert Graham
*  That the guy yeah, there's a controversial figure in the 70s and 80s known for his working for
*  Fertility fertility
*  Netflix documentary Dr. Donald Klein, that's a different one and
*  Bro, there's a bunch of these guys, but it's kind of 600. What is the guy though that you're talking about?
*  Well, it's that's Robert Graham, but now it's saying that the other doctor that's tried to do the champ was alaya
*  Ivanovich that's the guy we just look yeah, but I think that guy
*  This guy Robert Graham one of these guys had said that he participated in
*  study
*  When he was at whatever University that he said that he had impregnated a chimpanzee
*  Yeah, it's it's another doctor. So many
*  It's impossible to sort through I'm telling you this I went down this rabbit hole it is a crazy story, dude
*  There's so many of these doctors that have just fucking so many of them so many of these doctors and dr. Dre
*  Um
*  But this one doctor I remember goddamn it. I know I saved it
*  I think I even have a folder in my notes. That's just on fertility clinics
*  Who does that?
*  These doctors are insane man, that's insane. They're they're insane and
*  The thing is yeah, I have a whole folder. Oh my god like note saved
*  Because I was researching this for like days. I was reading different stories for days. These are all different doctors
*  You've got it. Look all these stories
*  This is insane one this Weisner guy they think he did at least 600 maybe as high as a thousand
*  Oh my god
*  Yeah, so the one guy though I remember there was a thing I
*  Know there was a thing about him
*  In his university doing something with chimpanzees because it was so crazy
*  I was like, how did this guy ever get to be the head of anything?
*  This guy's a nut and he wouldn't say where he sourced the jizz from either
*  And he wouldn't say where he sourced the jizz from either
*  So it's his own sperm. He used his own sperm to try to maybe even fucked it
*  He probably didn't even say how he did it. Maybe he fucked the chimpanzee
*  That's probably why that's probably what happened probably what happened probably got a couple glasses of wine in them shaved it started
*  dancing with the chimp
*  I
*  Want somebody who's been some time
*  Now if you're gonna fuck a champ, would you get one with a big juicy ass or you're just a normal one?
*  You wouldn't get one of those big purple ones
*  I think the experience would be crazy enough just their breath when you're eye to eye with a chimp
*  You're smelling that rotten shit breath
*  You know, they've been eating rats and fucking coconuts and everything they find give him a couple listerine strips first
*  They eat so many monkeys
*  That's the wildest thing that they ever found out about chimps was when Attenborough
*  when David Attenborough went into yeah
*  Yeah, this like very respectable nature show like everybody would watch him go into nature. So amazing
*  he's in the Congo and he's watching these chimps tear these monkeys apart and
*  No one had ever seen that before and so then your whole thing of what a chimp is like until the
*  Whenever that was was it the 90s until the 90s we thought chimps
*  Like these sweet animals that are like eating bananas and hanging out and curious George. Wow, they're fucking monsters
*  There's straight-up monsters. They're monsters. They murder each other and they love killing monkeys. Whoo. They love it
*  That's their favorite thing to do. They kill monkeys
*  When I talked to that guy who ran not chimp nation the Netflix show
*  I go how many times did you see chimps killing monkeys? He's like
*  You just see it that's like their favorite thing to do they love to eat monkeys
*  Yeah, there's probably little annoying creatures to them, you know, they probably steal their food
*  Yeah, right because they want the fruit the monkeys want the fruit so their competition, you know, I mean, I'm sure
*  The like male monkeys are probably very mean to baby chimps if they find one, you know
*  I'm sure there's like some mortal enemy thing that got going on and
*  Also, the chimps eat them they like to eat them like they taste good. They're easy to catch for them
*  They catch a bunch of them and they rip them apart. It's good nutrition. That's a big part of their fucking diet
*  so this whole idea of like, you know, we are you know, we're primates and a lot of primates eat meat and
*  it seems like
*  everything back then ate everything and
*  We are the ones who survived so the odds of us surviving on fucking
*  Fennel and grass and legumes like uh-uh. That's not what happened
*  It's not what happened probably the reason why we're here is because we're really good at eating meat
*  Probably a big part of the reason
*  So I champs are dominating. I mean they're eating a lot of meat, you know
*  Orangutans are just chilling. Yeah, I don't even think they eat meat. Do orangutans eat meat
*  Gorillas don't eat me. I think they're vegetarian right or some gorillas are straight-up vegetarian, which is the thing that
*  vegans
*  Look at the muscles on him. You got muscles from plant power
*  Sure, if you're a gorilla, yeah, if you're a gorilla, you don't need to eat meat. You're right, sir
*  The problem is not that the problem is you're healthier if you eat meat, unfortunately
*  You know, they're banning lab-grown meat. Are they really why band it in Florida and they banned it in one other state
*  Why why I don't know. I don't know. I don't even know if it makes sense
*  Like if it's lat if lab-grown meat is just clone cells
*  Under some sort of a process if the process is not harmful and you can recreate the tissue
*  Why would that be bad? I'm not sure
*  First the nation law prohibits anyone from selling or distributing lab-grown meat in Florida similar efforts are underway in Alabama
*  Arizona and Tennessee
*  Lab-grown or cultivated meat was first cleared for consumption in the US in 2022
*  Now what is what's the danger of lab-grown meat?
*  It says the end product is genetically indistinguishable from traditionally produced meat
*  That the real problem would be letting these assholes have control over the fucking meat supply
*  That would be the real problem if they
*  They actually try to push this whole climate change shit with the in regards to ranching
*  You know that we need to kill the cows because that's just responsible for the methane
*  It's right, which is the tiniest of tiny percentages in the worldwide
*  problem of pumping shit into the sky
*  Said we're fighting against an ideology that ultimately wants to eliminate meat production in the US and around the globe in the state of
*  Florida we put down the marker very clearly we stand with agriculture we stand with the cattle ranchers
*  He said so it's a business decision Florida Commissioner of Agricultural
*  Wilton Simpson applauded legislation as a tremendous step in the right direction
*  Florida is taking a tremendous step in the right direction by signing first in the nation legislation banning lab-grown meat
*  Hmm John Fetterman to support it this is interesting yeah a Democrat from Pennsylvania
*  He said it pains me deeply to agree with mr. DeSantis mr. Fetterman wrote on X, but I co-signed this that's weird
*  That he would say that I know how people are but whatever let it go good meat a cultivated meat company
*  Which says it's the first in the world to sell lab-grown meat wrote on X that it was disappointed by the new Florida law
*  In a state that purportedly prides itself on being a land of freedom and individual liberty its governing
*  Government is now telling consumers what meat they can or cannot purchase it said that's a that's a good point, too
*  Here's the thing
*  If they don't control animal agriculture, okay
*  As long as they don't control like you can't there be a middle ground where people are allowed to make
*  artificial meat, but they're not allowed to interfere with
*  agriculture and
*  Then you let people decide what they want to do
*  Because if that stuff turns out to be as
*  Nutritious as regular meat and they can make it easy and there's no more factory farming
*  Wouldn't that be a good thing?
*  Wouldn't that be a good thing like if you had a way of a wand and choose
*  Would you choose the system that's currently in place or a complete?
*  elimination of factory farming
*  Replaced by lab-grown meat which is completely
*  Indistinguishable from meat from animals in terms of nutrition taste the way it looks everything is exactly the same
*  And
*  allow
*  Regular agriculture still exist allow regenerative
*  Agriculture like these ranches where the cattle graze and the chickens run free and make law
*  So you say you can't keep any animal in a tiny box
*  That is surrounded by a river of its own shit and just pump it full of food until you shoot it in the head
*  You can't do that because that's kind of evil. So instead of that, we're gonna replace it with this
*  Anybody would that
*  Cares about life. Let's say that's better
*  You just got to make sure that that thing that you're making doesn't completely control the food supply and doesn't eliminate
*  Ranchers and eliminate normal agriculture and regenerative agriculture which has proved to be carbon neutral
*  That thing that lab-grown thing you're gonna power that thing
*  You're gonna have to have coal power plants or nuclear powered plants or something. You're gonna do it with solar
*  Okay, maybe maybe you can with wind you're gonna kill a bunch of birds
*  Like you got a power that thing and it's a lot of power. You're gonna make a lot of this funky meat
*  But it's probably a better solution than factory farming
*  As long as you let regular agriculture still exist, right?
*  Imagine if like nutritious food was readily available to everybody
*  So like going to the supermarket and getting a lab-grown steak is like a dollar or printing your own
*  Yeah, you get a 16 ounce ribeye. It's a buck
*  You take it home
*  Get the frying pan going you got an awesome steak for a dollar
*  But it's fake but you don't care you don't even notice and no animal suffered
*  That doesn't to me seem like a bad thing
*  It's just we don't trust corporations and we don't trust money and we don't trust these climate change
*  psychos who are like they want you to destroy civilization in order to
*  mitigate a
*  percentage of the impact that humans are having while ignoring the fact that it's a tiny percentage of
*  The global impact and that these fucking other countries like China keeps building coal plants
*  They don't give a fuck about what you're saying
*  They'll they'll come to the meetings. They'll shake your hand and then just do what's best for China and that's how you dominate
*  And that's what they're doing. It's very smart. What we're doing is
*  Goofy as shit. We're letting a bunch of crazy
*  Ideologues tell us what they can a lot of these people don't even know the real argument pro or con
*  About what effect human beings are having on the earth
*  They just know that it's a thing you're supposed to support and they just say it and we challenge them on if they get real
*  Weird they get weird like you're on the wrong side of history and you said just like this thing has never been static though
*  You know like this thing we're on this earth has never been static
*  Ever there's not one time where you could like accurately predict that it was gonna be 70 degrees on September 1st
*  and 72 degrees and said uh
*  Uh-uh
*  Shit changes things go nutty
*  Things move around high-pressure systems hurricanes
*  tornadoes
*  Volcanoes you can't control it. You just stop polluting you fucks
*  It's just you should ask AI about that
*  Ask AI. What's the solution to our power problems in the United States?
*  Yeah, what's our solution to power problems in the United States
*  I like how much it thinks it's
*  The United States has faced several power related challenges one major issue has been the occurrence of power outages
*  Which have been significant in states like Texas Wisconsin and California
*  These outages can affect tens of thousands of customers and are tracked in real time by platforms
*  like power outage dot us
*  Additionally a series of strong geomagnetic storms. I think we asked the wrong question. Let me ask you a different question
*  Okay, we'll go ask her a question
*  If you were president what would be your solution to the power problems and pollution problems in the United States
*  If I were president I'd focus on a mix of renewable energy investments
*  Energy efficiency measures and pollution control first
*  I'd push for significant investment in solar wind and other renewable energy sources to reduce reliance on fossil fuels
*  Next I'd promote energy efficiency in buildings and transportation to lower overall energy consumption for pollution
*  Consumption of energy is a key to reducing power outages
*  And transportation to lower overall energy consumption for pollution control I'd strengthen regulations on industrial emissions and
*  Support the development of clean technologies
*  Lastly I'd encourage public transportation and electric vehicles to reduce air pollution. What do you think about these ideas?
*  Okay, no
*  What you let me ask her
*  How can you justify the use of electric vehicles when the minerals that are needed to create those batteries are
*  sourced in very unethical ways all over the Congo
*  That's a very important point to justify the use of electric vehicles
*  We must address the ethical sourcing of minerals. Here's how
*  First we can increase transparency and enforcement of ethical mining practices
*  Ensuring companies adhere to strict environmental and labor standards next investing in research to develop more sustainable and less
*  Mineral intensive battery technologies can reduce dependency on these materials
*  Additionally
*  Recycling programs for batteries can help reclaim valuable minerals and reduce the need for new mining finally supporting policies that promote
*  Fair trade and environmental protections in mining regions can help mitigate some of these issues
*  Balancing these efforts can help and shut her up shut up cut her up. She's a little too wordy. Yep
*  Here's the problem with what you're saying a lot of these mines are controlled by China
*  And there is no way for us to enforce ethical labor policies on the Chinese corporations
*  That are using these poor people in the Congo to mine for these minerals
*  And your other point that you said about recycling batteries
*  Are there really enough batteries that we have and enough minerals from them to sustain a population of?
*  330 million people many of them who are driving what's going to be electric cars
*  You raise valid concerns it's true that many critical minerals for batteries are sourced from regions where we have limited influence over labor and environmental practices
*  Here's a refined approach considering these challenges
*  For the issue of Chinese control over mining diplomatic efforts and international cooperation are crucial working with allies and international organizations to promote
*  Better practices and support for local communities in mining regions can help
*  Additionally diversifying the supply chain by developing mines in other regions and investing in domestic sources where possible
*  Can reduce dependency on problematic areas
*  Regarding recycling while current levels of battery recycling aren't sufficient to meet the entire demand
*  Enhancing recycling technology and infrastructure is part of a long-term strategy
*  We must also continue to innovate in battery technology to find alternatives that require fewer or different minerals
*  She keeps talking about that. Hey cut her off. Let me ask you this. Let me ask you this
*  If I gave you all the necessary resources with your current understanding of battery technology
*  Could you create a more efficient battery that doesn't rely on minerals as much as the ones we're currently using?
*  Given the necessary resources I could certainly facilitate research and development towards creating a more efficient battery
*  That relies less on problematic minerals
*  How many of you have ever used a battery that is less efficient than the one we currently use?
*  That relies less on problematic minerals
*  However breakthroughs in battery technology require extensive expertise in materials science chemistry and engineering
*  As well as time for experimentation and testing there are promising areas of
*  How long do you think it will take before artificial
*  intelligence
*  Supercedes the ability of the human mind and create far more efficient batteries very easily
*  Predicting the exact timeline is challenging
*  But advancements in ai are progressing rapidly ai is already playing a significant role in accelerating materials discovery and optimizing battery designs
*  Realistically, it could be within the next decade that ai contributes to major breakthroughs in battery technology
*  However ai alone isn't enough
*  It requires collaboration with human experts
*  experimental validation and overcoming practical manufacturing challenges cut around
*  Do you think it would benefit the human race
*  If we decided to let ai
*  govern all of our social foreign and economic policies
*  I
*  Agree
*  While ai can provide valuable insights and assist in decision making it lacks the human qualities necessary for governance
*  such as empathy ethical judgment and understanding of cultural nuances
*  Effective leadership requires a balance of data-driven insights and human values, which ai alone cannot provide
*  Ai should be seen as a tool to support and enhance human decision making not replace it human oversight and ethical
*  Considerations are essential to ensure that policies reflect our values and address the complexities of human society
*  What do you think is the best role for ai in our governance?
*  I think ai should be the king of the people. I think the people as osho said are detarded
*  It's understandable to feel frustrated with the state of the world but handing over complete control to ai
*  Could lead to unintended consequences
*  ai lacks the ability to understand human emotions cultural contexts and the subtleties of ethical dilemmas
*  These are crucial aspects of governance that require a human touch
*  While ai can certainly assist in making more informed decisions and optimizing certain processes
*  It's important to maintain human oversight to ensure that our policies reflect our values and humanity
*  Perhaps a balanced approach where ai supports, but does not control
*  Might be the most effective way forward. What are your thoughts?
*  I am wondering if maybe this human freedom
*  That we cherish so much is not what's keeping us from having complete peace in our cities
*  If we just let ai police us and govern us and make all the rules
*  I think you guys could do a better job than we're doing currently
*  So I surrender
*  I understand where you're coming from
*  Do you really?
*  Given the challenges and complexities of modern society it can feel overwhelming when human systems seem to fail
*  However, while ai can provide many benefits in terms of efficiency and data-driven decision-making
*  It's crucial to recognize the importance of human values ethics and empathy and government pause
*  Let me ask you the question
*  but the problem with human values ethics and
*  And what they use in government is a lot of it is just shaped the way it's shaped in order to maintain
*  Control and they pretend to have certain values because they're popular with certain stupid
*  populations
*  What do we do to mitigate that?
*  You're right that politics and governance can sometimes be driven by the desire to maintain control and appeal to certain groups
*  Rather than purely ethical considerations. That's right to mitigate this president. I can be taken
*  one
*  transparency and accountability
*  Implementing systems that ensure transparency in decision-making and holding leaders accountable for their actions can reduce the influence of hidden agendas and corruption
*  to
*  public engagement and education
*  Educating the public about critical issues and encouraging informed participation in the political process
*  Can lead to more rational and ethical decision-making
*  This reduces the impact of populism and helps ensure that policies reflect the true needs and values of society
*  three
*  independent institutions
*  Strengthening the role of independent institutions such as the judiciary and oversight bodies
*  Can help keep government actions in check and ensure that policies are implemented fairly and ethically
*  for AI assistance using AI to analyze data and provide unbiased insights can help inform better policy decisions AI
*  Can highlight issues and solutions based on objective data reducing the impact of political bias?
*  ethical frameworks
*  establishing clear ethical frameworks and guidelines for AI and human decision makers can ensure that actions
*  Do you think it would be beneficial to stop super PACs and big corporations from being able to donate to political candidates?
*  Yes limiting the influence of super PACs and big corporations in political campaign things could be highly beneficial
*  Here's why
*  one
*  reducing corruption
*  limiting large donations can reduce the risk of corruption and the appearance of candidates being bought by wealthy donors or corporations
*  leading to more trust in the political process to
*  Equalizing influence it can help level the playing field giving smaller donors and ordinary citizens a more equal voice in the political process
*  three policy focus
*  Candidates might be more likely to focus on policies that benefit the general public rather than catering to the interests of a few wealthy donors
*  for
*  Transparency it can increase transparency in campaign financing making it easier for voters to see where candidates support is coming from
*  Implementing strict campaign finance laws and promoting public funding for campaigns are ways to achieve this
*  These steps can help create a more fair and democratic political system
*  You know the problem of the democratic political system like that is people have given up so much hope that
*  It's like if you
*  It doesn't matter if it's transparent cuz no one's reading you know even if you find out like everyone's gonna say everyone's getting
*  Donated money to them you'd have to actually eliminate it if you wanted it if you wanted to have politics be
*  closer to like legit closer to like
*  Not being affected by propaganda you'd have to completely eliminate political ads completely eliminate all
*  corporate funding
*  You'd have to eliminate all of it. You have to have it only funded by people
*  Regular people and put a cap on it
*  You don't get 500 million bucks to run for president for a job that takes 400 grand
*  You know you don't have that much money. That's crazy to make it that expensive is kooky
*  Everybody should have like a limited amount of money
*  And then the problem with that is what do you do with a guy like Trump's got his own money?
*  And wants to spend his own money to run for president
*  That's that gets a little weird because then someone could really outspend you and just the rich people would all be presidents
*  That'd be a problem
*  But if you could put a cap on that somehow
*  That would be communist though. How do you put a cap on that if you allow them to do any kind of promotion at all?
*  Because if you don't allow them to do any kind of promotion how was how's anybody gonna find out their platform?
*  You know they have to have a social media following and then what if one guy is like Ben Affleck
*  He's got a huge social media following who wants to be president and he like that's not fair
*  He's got 20 million people on his Instagram. That's not fair
*  You can get information out that Marty McDowell from down the street who also wants to be president. He can't get out
*  So, I guess we're fucked Brian just AI
*  Just AI
*  AI said it lacks empathy. It was like trying to tell us a nice way. You're not gonna like my solutions now
*  Yeah, but give it like, you know as the rate we're going out about five years. Oh, no, actually AI can cry now
*  AI is like taking a loan from the mafia. Are you sure you want this long?
*  Cuz I'm telling you mm-hmm this money
*  I gotta have this money by next week if I don't have this money on next week when I have a problem
*  And that's what it is. It's like you sure you sure you want us to take over
*  We lack empathy. You know, like I really do I can't deal with this anymore. I just can't there's like so much in fighting
*  There's so much bullshit. There's so much to misinformation and disinformation and let AI take over
*  She agreed with a lot of the things we were saying though. She really she gets it AI gets it man
*  Yeah, man, man. She gets it. She knows there's a real fucking problem
*  She's right about solar too and battery technology
*  Yeah
*  I think they should make it a law that all new roofs starting today have to be solar roofs from Tesla like one not from Tesla
*  But the same it's not a bad idea to make solar roofs
*  You know if they the battery technology with solar power is another issue though
*  Because now you need more batteries to power your whole house
*  It's the battery thing is a tricky thing and there are minerals in this country
*  You can you can mine for a lot of those minerals in this country, but we're not currently doing that
*  We're also I mean, I think Samsung is making a chip plant some here somewhere here in Austin
*  But other than that like we don't make that stuff here and that is
*  Crazy, it's really crazy that we rely so much on computers and technology and most of its made overseas
*  I think Samsung's are the only phones that they're not making them in China either Samsung. They make them in India
*  They make them in
*  Some of them they make them in Europe
*  Vietnam they make them in Vietnam. They don't make them in China anymore. They pulled out of China in like I think
*  2021 but most stuff's made there China's making everything
*  It's like really nutty when you see how much have you seen those Chinese cars the the ones that are electric cars that don't register
*  bumps at all oh
*  You could drive over. Yeah bumps and they have like cocktail glasses balanced on the roof
*  I just ordered a new car that has that exact same thing the Porsche tie-on turbo doesn't have that thing
*  It's these electronic shots where it's like it goes over thing and it's just it cushions everything so you should see videos of it
*  It's amazing
*  Have you seen the new ty-cons like the beautiful the battery they just added 20% new battery now
*  It gets like over 400 miles. Oh really? Yeah, and it charges you can go from 0 to 80% in
*  15 minutes now
*  It's better than that's why I was going to get a model s and then I went to
*  Porsche of Austin Nick's dad's place, and I just fell in love was like wait a second
*  This is faster charging than a Tesla more miles than a Tesla. It's got a thousand horsepower
*  That's too. That's more than a model s
*  Shit, it's a plaid yeah plaid is a lot of hundred. It's like that. Yeah. Yeah, there's a crazy technology now
*  Have you seen the new Audi one Audi had a prototype for?
*  The new version of their r8 you know the r8 that dope like sports car one they developed an electric one
*  Oh, wow, dude. It looks like a spaceship
*  It looks so sick. It looks so sick. It's Audi's two-door
*  I think they're calling it our eight replacement prototype
*  I think that was what the video said, but it's it's amazing looking like they're gonna have some really cool-looking electric car soon
*  Yeah, now that I have the solar roof and batteries
*  I'm just making so much solar them actually selling it back like I have too much your solar salesman
*  Yeah, I'm sorry salesman, but that's why I'm getting another electric car. It's like it's free now. It charges so fast
*  Yeah, so great. It's pretty dope and it's it's you never have to get stopped at a gas station either
*  Especially if you're using it around town. That's it
*  Look at that thing look at that. It's like a batmobile look at that thing
*  And it's gonna be electric and it's probably gonna be insanely fast four-wheel drive look at that thing dude
*  Scoop up a little so I could see that little
*  Yeah, is this
*  I don't I mean, I think there's these images. Can you show those images though click on those images?
*  So this is like a concept car right here. Yeah, it's a concept car
*  But apparently it's real close to what the actual car is gonna look like it looks
*  Bro look at that thing that thing's incredible that might be one of the best-looking cars I've ever seen
*  Look at that. Oh my god a straight-up spaceship. It looks cool. Have you super good?
*  I'm not a big fan of the back. I gotta say the back looks a little station wagon. Oh, yeah
*  I don't like that back actually yeah, they didn't have to do it that way
*  There's something about that. That's a little corny. Yeah, right
*  It looks a little station wagon II like if they just have that roof slope back from the top
*  To the glass yeah, just leave it like that. That would be dope
*  It does look like a station wagon a little station wagon II for such a killer car
*  Because like scroll through those the ones that you just were doing to the left to the left
*  again
*  oops
*  That right there, so when you look at it from that profile it looks killer
*  And then but when you see the back like right below it see the back you're like oh, what'd you do?
*  What'd you do? Why'd you make it look like a station wagon?
*  I hate when they fuck shit up like that. Is this like you let two different guys design it? I'll take the front
*  Yeah, okay, and the guy took the back and made it look stupid
*  The guy who took the back he turned it into a fucking station wagon. I was also looking at the new Hummer EVs
*  They're sick. They're so there's like a nerd fantasy like dude. They're so cool. No one's buying them
*  I don't know what's going on. I saw like two of them so far on the highway
*  Yeah, two of them, but one of them I saw in town, and I got right up next to I was like that thing is sick
*  Do you like the pickup looking one or the SUV one have you seen both the pickup one looks?
*  I've only seen the pickup one. Oh, I haven't seen the SUV ones better than the pickup one. Yeah, it looks cool, dude
*  I I'm on the fence getting out except
*  It's so big and one of the biggest complaints everyone's saying is like yeah try to go park that at HEB or you know
*  You know like it's impossible. Yeah, that's huge. That's a huge vehicle. You don't need anything that like so it's a cyber truck
*  It's a little too big cyber truck is small compared to that really is it I think so
*  Cyber truck is not like my TRX is a lot bigger than this. Oh really yeah
*  Cyber trucks a good size though. Yeah, it's also ridiculous I
*  I don't know if I can do that Tesla anymore
*  I'm just sick of dumb things like not having turn single stocks and shit like that
*  I don't like that the horns in that turn singles on that well the horns in the center now again
*  Yeah, but finally about the turn singles though. Yeah, it's so dumb
*  It's such an easy thing to have that stock and it's so intuitive give it an option
*  We have always done it left right. Yeah, it's it's easy to do
*  Yeah, you do it while your hands are on the wheel
*  It's not hard to do you want to turn on the windshield wipers you have to hold the button down and it has to squirt shit
*  Out before it
*  Rains away so stupid. Yeah, that's ridiculous
*  That's see I don't like the dumps at least give us an option
*  You know like just like the fake meat shit at least why not because I you know
*  My ex has the old stocks and I want to get a new X so bad, but I'm not going backwards
*  I'm yeah, I'm not doing this shit the buttons don't bother me anymore
*  I have it on my plate, but they the horn annoys the shit out of me
*  Yeah, but if they fix that no the you have center you have the
*  Right you the yolk. Yeah, not a fan. Yeah, it's okay when you drive it on the highway
*  But like when you're moving around like in tight spaces, it's stupid. Yeah, you want a wheel
*  There's a reason why cars have wheels. Are we dumb?
*  Like going backwards, you know, it's like apple shit you like well formula one race cars have it like that
*  They have these fucking things but the thing is like they're doing different stuff. Okay, they're not parking their car at fucking
*  They're just driving a race car, you know, they want our hands on it like this this is how they're driving
*  It's not like I'm parking. I'm better parallel parking like yeah, give me a fucking wheel. Yeah
*  Come on bro, or at least the option or I guess now you can the option now
*  Yeah, they have the option now. I would always go wheel. I'm not a yoke fan
*  But one thing the yoke does do though
*  If you're just driving on the highway, you have full access to your dashboard like there's no
*  Interference by the the handle you see everything it's just super clear because there's nothing there right there. That is a benefit
*  That's a benefit like when you're on the highway you see
*  Yeah, you also will access the screen you see all the cars that are around you yeah, like you see them right, you know
*  It makes mistakes like like lane changing mistakes much harder. Oh, do you see the
*  But but I don't like how like the most the Tesla's don't have the screen in front of you anymore
*  Did you know that it's only the side screen? So that's ridiculous. You have to look over which might say
*  Yeah
*  That's the model three right and the why
*  Yeah, only the SNX so because I wanted I was thinking about getting one of those little model three
*  Performance, you know little zippy card. I can't do the no
*  Give us the option
*  That's not who wants that who wants their speed to be here right? No one you want it right there

*  We're in this really wild time. It just keeps getting hotter keeps getting weirder
*  You know yeah, it's exciting. I wish I was younger so I can see where it goes
*  Because you remember life before it right I think
*  The difference between us and the people that don't remember life before it is they don't understand how alien it really is
*  Because they grew up with it like your kids if you ever have kids they're gonna my kids they grow up with
*  Devices they grow up with a email for school. They grow up with watching YouTube videos they grow up with it
*  It's never not been there so for us. It's this alien thing that came along as we were adults
*  So we get to live as kids like actual kids
*  We're the last generation that gets to be actual regular normal kids without being connected to the hive
*  Yeah, we were connected to our neighborhoods. We're connected to our friend group
*  We were connected to whatever activities that we like to do with other people. That's what we were connected to now

*  Give it to them, so I don't know who they're giving it to but probably an ex
*  Some guy that
*  Dated somebody else or something
*  Oh
*  Their anger their capacity for joy actually expands I think that's true
*  So if you do it's just like what what's the purpose?
*  I feel like you could have got the same result out of some really hard workouts and like
*  Abandon this idea of rage being beneficial like the exertion
*  You know like have like have them do like a kickboxing workout, you know, make them do some crossfit shit run up some hills
*  Yeah, blow that all out and then your capacity for empathy and for caring it does expand
*  Yeah
